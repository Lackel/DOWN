The use of convex relaxations has lately gained considerable interest in Power Systems. These relaxations play a major role in providing quality guarantees for non-convex optimization problems. For the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is known to produce tight lower bounds. Unfortunately, SDP solvers still suffer from a lack of scalability. In this work, we introduce an exact reformulation of the SDP relaxation, formed by a set of polynomial constraints defined in the space of real variables. The new constraints can be seen as cuts, strengthening weaker second-order cone relaxations, and can be generated in a lazy iterative fashion. The new formulation can be handled by standard nonlinear programming solvers, enjoying better stability and computational efficiency. This new approach benefits from recent results on tree-decomposition methods, reducing the dimension of the underlying SDP matrices. As a side result, we present a formulation of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law in the SDP space and reveal the existing link between these cycle constraints and the original SDP relaxation for three dimensional matrices. Preliminary results show a significant gain in computational efficiency compared to a standard SDP solver approach.	1.3
In this work a classical derivation of fractional order circuits models is presented. Generalised constitutive equations in terms of fractional Riemann-Liouville derivatives are introduced in the Maxwell's equations for each circuit element. Next the Kirchhoff voltage law is applied in a RCL circuit configuration. It is shown that from basic properties of Fractional Calculus, a fractional differential equation model with Caputo derivatives is obtained. Thus standard initial conditions apply. Finally, models for bioimpedance are revisited. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1.3
This paper presents an investigation on high energy rate micro forming (HERMF) of a thin aluminum foil using a high velocity forming (HVF) technique. A model is proposed for the work of deformation and efficiencies involved in every stage of energy transfer. The forming action has been achieved through incident shockwaves, which cause plastic deformation in the blank to take the shape of the die cavity. The shockwaves are generated by a rapid capacitive discharge of energy across a fuse wire inside the water. The paper presents an analysis to predict the amount of energy required for a desired depth of hemispherical deformation, based on the principles of plastic deformation and volume constancy. The energy transferred from the capacitor bank to the fuse wire is modeled using Kirchhoff's voltage law and the Joule heating principle. An indigenous micro-electro-hydro-forming (EHF) setup developed in-house is used to validate the analytical model developed through a set of experiments. Readings are optimized against the number of parameters present in the entire process. Validation for the suggested analytical model is carried out by comparing theoretical and experimentally measured values of the depth of deformation of a 20-mu m thick aluminum foil. The results obtained are encouraging, and the highest error in the predictive ability of our model was found to be 30 %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at analytically modeling the depth of deformation for a given value of supplied electrical energy in the micro-domain.	1.3
In photogrammetry, remote sensing, computer vision and robotics, a topic of major interest is represented by the automatic analysis of 3D point cloud data. This task often relies on the use of geometric features amongst which particularly the ones derived from the eigenvalues of the 3D structure tensor (e.g. the three dimensionality features of linearity, planarity and sphericity) have proven to be descriptive and are therefore commonly involved for classification tasks. Although these geometric features are meanwhile considered as standard, very little attention has been paid to their accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we hence focus on the influence of discretization and noise on the most commonly used geometric features. More specifically, we investigate the accuracy and robustness of the eigenvalues of the 3D structure tensor and also of the features derived from these eigenvalues. Thereby, we provide both analytical and numerical considerations which clearly reveal that certain features are more susceptible to discretization and noise whereas others are more robust.

The Euler number of a binary image is an important topological feature for many image processing, image analysis, pattern recognition, and computer vision applications. This paper proposes a new run-based Euler number computation algorithm. The conventional run-based algorithm processes rows of the given image one-by-one from top to bottom in a single phase. For each row, it finds the runs in the row and records the start and end locations of each run to compute neighbor runs. In contrast, our algorithm calculates the Euler number of an image in two phases. In the first phase, we process odd rows alternately to find runs and only record its end location. In the second phase, we process each of the remaining even rows to find runs and calculate neighboring runs between the current row and the rows immediately above and below using the recorded run data. Using this method, the number of accesses required to compute the Euler number decreases in almost all cases. Analysis of the time complexity and experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms conventional Euler number computation algorithms.	0.0
How can individuals be convinced to act on climate change? It is widely assumed that emphasizing personal responsibility for climate change is effective at increasing pro-climate behavior whereas collectively framing the causes of climate change diffuses responsibility and dampens the incentive for individual action. We observe the opposite result. Here we find, across three experiments, that emphasizing collective responsibility for the causes of climate change increases pro-climate monetary donations by approximately 7 % in environmental group members and by 50 % in the general public. Further, highlighting collective responsibility amplifies intent to reduce future carbon emissions. In contrast, focusing on personal responsibility for climate change does not significantly alter donations to climate change advocacy or the intent for future pro-climate behavior. These effects replicate and persist multiple days after treatment.	2.4
Since the proposal of a fast learning algorithm for deep belief networks in 2006, the deep learning techniques have drawn ever-increasing research interests because of their inherent capability of overcoming the drawback of traditional algorithms dependent on hand-designed features. Deep learning approaches have also been found to be suitable for big data analysis with successful applications to computer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In this paper, we discuss some widely used deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized. Applications of deep learning techniques on some selected areas (speech recognition, pattern recognition and computer vision) are highlighted. A list of future research topics are finally given with clear justifications.	0.0
In this study we examined prosocial compensating behavior towards socially excluded ingroup and outgroup members by using a 'Prosocial Cyberball Game' in 9-17 year old Dutch adolescents (N = 133). Results showed that adolescents compensated for the social exclusion of an unknown peer in a virtual ball tossing game, by tossing the ball more often to that player in compensation conditions compared to the fair play condition. The proportion of tosses towards the excluded player did not significantly differ as a function of the group status of that player. Although compensating behavior towards ingroup versus outgroup members did not differ, the underlying motivation for this behavior may vary. More empathic concern was associated with more prosocial tosses towards an ingroup member, while more self-reported bullying behavior was associated with less compensating behavior in the outgroup condition. These findings may have practical implications for programs intending to change bystander behavior in bullying situations. (C) 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

Establishing correspondences is a fundamental task in many image processing and computer vision applications. In particular, finding the correspondences between a non-linearly deformed image pair induced by different modality conditions is a challenging problem. This paper describes a simple but powerful image transform called local area transform (LAT) for modality-robust correspondence estimation. Specifically, TAT transforms an image from the intensity domain to the local area domain, which is invariant under nonlinear intensity deformations, especially radiometric, photometric, and spectral deformations. Experimental results show that LATransformed images provide a consistency for nonlinearly deformed images, even under random intensity deformations. LAT reduces the mean absolute difference by approximately 0.20 and the different pixel ratio by approximately 58% on average, as compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the reformulation of descriptors with LAT shows superiority to conventional methods, which is a promising result for the tasks of cross-spectral and modality correspondence matching. LAT gains an approximately 23% improvement in the correct detection ratio and a 10% improvement in the recognition rate for the tasks of RGB-NIR cross-spectral template matching and cross-spectral feature matching, respectively. LAT reduces the bad pixel percentage by approximately 15% and the root mean squared errors by 13.5 in the task of cross-radiation stereo matching. LAT also improves the cross-modal dense flow estimation task in terms of warping error, providing 50% error reduction.	0.0
This study examined the role of children's trust beliefs and trustworthiness in the development of prosocial behavior using data from four waves of a longitudinal study in a large, ethnically-diverse sample of children in Switzerland (mean age = 8.11 years at Time 1, N = 1,028). Prosocial behavior directed towards peers was measured at all assessment points by teacher reports. Children's trust beliefs and their trustworthiness with peers were assessed and calculated by a social relations analysis at the first assessment point using children's reports of the extent to which classmates kept promises. In addition, teacher reports of children's trustworthiness were assessed at all four assessment points. Latent growth curve modeling yielded a decrease in prosocial behavior over time. Peer- and teacher-reported trustworthiness predicted higher initial levels of prosocial behavior, and peer-reported trustworthiness predicted less steep decreases in prosocial behavior over time. Autoregressive cross-lagged analysis also revealed bidirectional longitudinal associations between teacher-reported trustworthiness and prosocial behavior. We discuss the implications of the findings for research on the role of trust in the development of children's prosocial behavior.	2.4
We propose a stochastic programming-based tool to support adaptive transmission planning under market and regulatory uncertainties. We model investments in two stages, differentiating between commitments that must be made now and corrective actions that can be undertaken as new information becomes available. The objective is to minimize expected transmission and generation costs over the time horizon. Nonlinear constraints resulting from Kirchhoff's voltage law are included. We apply the tool to a 240-bus representation of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and model uncertainty using three scenarios with distinct renewable electricity mandates, emissions policies, and fossil fuel prices. We conclude that the cost of ignoring uncertainty (the cost of using naive deterministic planning methods relative to explicitly modeling uncertainty) is of the same order of magnitude as the cost of first-stage transmission investments. Furthermore, we conclude that heuristic rules for constructing transmission plans based on scenario planning can be as suboptimal as deterministic plans.	1.3
The internal quality of intact persimmon cv. 'Rojo Brillante' was assessed trough visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging. Fruits at three stages of commercial maturity were exposed to different treatments with CO2 to obtain fruit with different ripeness and level of astringency (soluble tannin content). Spectral and spatial information were used for building classification models to predict ripeness and astringency trough multivariate analysis techniques like linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (LDA and QDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, flesh firmness was predicted by partial least square regression (PLSR). The full spectrum was used to determine the internal properties and later principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select optimal wavelengths (580, 680 and 1050 nm). The correct classification was above 92% for the three classifiers in the case of ripeness and 95% for QDA in the case of astringency. A value of R-2 = 0.80 and a ratio of prediction deviation (RPD) of 1.86 were obtained with the selected wavelengths for the prediction of firmness which demonstrated the potential of hyperspectral imaging as a non-destructive tool in the assessment of the firmness, ripeness state and astringency level of 'Rojo Brillante' persimmon.

Several studies show that there is a connection between religion and prosociality (e.g., Saroglou, 2013). To investigate whether there is a causal relationship between these two variables, a growing number of scholars employed priming religious concepts and measure its influence on prosocial behavior (e.g., Pichon, Boccato, & Saroglou, 2007). In the recent development of religious priming, Ritter and Preston (2013) argued that different primes (agent prime, spiritual/abstract prime, and institutional prime) may also have varying influence on prosocial behavior specifically helping an ingroup or an outgroup target. With this in mind, a 2 (social categorization of the target of help) by 3 (agent prime, institutional prime, spiritual prime) experiment was conducted to directly investigate this hypothesis. Results suggest that priming religious concepts especially the spiritual prime can increase prosocial behaviors. However, no significant effect was found on the social categorization which implies that Filipino participants elicit prosocial behavior regardless of the social categorization (be it ingroup or outgroup) of the target of help. The present study's findings contribute to further the literature on religious priming and its influence on prosocial behavior.	2.4
During the folding process substrates are exposed to high-localized stresses, which in the case of coated papers and boards, can lead to decreased aesthetic features or complete loss of functionality. Production efficiency of the folding process could be improved by an automated, computer vision-based inspection system. For such a task, different existing computer-aided fold-crack evaluation approaches were analyzed. A detailed research was conducted to propose an image processing based fold cracking assessment via finding optimal sample preparation and digitization techniques and developing an algorithm for the digital image analysis and feature extraction. The analysis of the applicability of different sample preparation and digitization parameters, as well as the proposed digital image feature, was done by correlation evaluation, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and corresponding post hoc tests. The results indicated that the developed algorithm fulfils the set requirements and the proposed feature of digitized samples faithfully describes the analyzed fold-cracks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction. The perception of a direct gaze that is, of another individual's gaze directed at the observer that leads to eye contact is known to influence a wide range of cognitive processes and behaviors. We stress that these effects mainly reflect positive impacts on human cognition and may thus be used as relevant tools for therapeutic purposes. Objectives. In this review, we aim (1) to provide an exhaustive review of eye contact effects while discussing the limits of the dominant models used to explain these effects, (2) to illustrate the therapeutic potential of eye contact by targeting those pathologies that show both preserved gaze processing and deficits in one or several functions that are targeted by the eye contact effects, and (3) to propose concrete ways in which eye contact could be employed as a therapeutic tool. Discussion. (1) We regroup the variety of eye contact effects into four categories, including memory effects, activation of prosocial behavior, positive appraisals of self and others and the enhancement of self-awareness. We emphasize that the models proposed to account for these effects have a poor predictive value and that further descriptions of these effects is needed. (2) We then emphasize that people with pathologies that affect memory, social behavior, and self and/or other appraisal, and self-awareness could benefit from eye contact effects. We focus on depression, autism and Alzheimer's disease to illustrate our proposal. To our knowledge, no anomaly of eye contact has been reported in depression. Patients suffering from Alzheimer disease, at the early and moderate stage, have been shown to maintain a normal amount of eye contact with their interlocutor. We take into account that autism is controversial regarding whether gaze processing is preserved or altered. In the first view, individuals are thought to elude or omit gazing at another's eyes while in the second, individuals are considered to not be able to process the gaze of others. We adopt the first stance following the view that people with autism are not interested in processing social signals such as gaze but could do so efficiently if properly motivated. For each pathology we emphasize that eye contact could be used, for example, to enhance sensitivity to bodily states, thus improving emotional decision making (in autism); to lead to more positive appraisal of the self and others (in depression); to improve memory performances (in Alzheimer disease) and, more generally, to motivate the recipient to engage in the therapeutic process. (3) Finally we propose two concrete ways to employ eye contact effects as a therapeutic tool. The first is to develop cognitive-behavioral tools to learn and/or motivate the recipient to create frequent and prolonged eye contact periods. The second is to raise awareness among caregivers of the beneficial effects of eye contact and to teach them the way to use eye contact to reach its optimum effects. Future investigations are however needed to explore the ways in which eye contact effects can be efficiently integrated in therapeutic strategies, as well as to identify the clinical populations that can benefit from such therapeutic interventions.

1. Metabolism of ABT-107 was investigated in in vitro hepatic systems, in rat and monkey receiving [C-14] ABT-107, and in vivo plasma in rat, dog, monkey and human. 2. In in vitro hepatic systems, ABT-107 was primarily cleared via oxidative metabolism, and proceeded via two parallel pathways. Pathway 1, ABT-107 was oxidized at the nitrogen of quinuclidine moiety to form M1. Pathway 2, oxidation occurred at indole-containing moiety to form M2. Metabolism via N-oxidation was predominant in dog and rat, while in monkey and human, metabolism proceeded primarily via oxidation of indole-containing moiety. 3. ABT-107 was extensively metabolized in vivo in rat and monkey. M1 was primarily found in rat urine and bile; whereas, M2 was the major metabolite in monkey urine and feces. M1 was the predominant circulating metabolite in dog and rat. M2 was the primary circulating metabolite in monkey and human. 4. Enzymatic studies suggested M1 formation was primarily mediated by renal FMO1. CYP3A4, 1A2, 2J2 and 2D6 were primary enzymes catalyzing M2 formation. 5. Biotransformation of ABT-107 in human and monkey is markedly different from that in dog and rat, suggesting that monkey is an appropriate model for predicting human biotransformation and toxicology of ABT-107.	6.2
Gabriel Abend discusses his interest in the sociology of morality and the main ideas of his book The Moral Background: An Inquiry into the History of Business Ethics [Abend 2014]. According to Abend, the business ethics discipline and its growing popularity at business schools deals not only with the tension between making money and being ethical, but with the preconditions which enable moral life: the moral background. Abend states that studying moralities and moral action in the social sciences is usually viewed through the lens of the first one, behavioral level, and the second one, normative level (moral and immoral behavior and norms, respectively), which, taken together, constitute first-order morality. Abend also points out that the moral background should be suggested as the third level, or second-order morality, which underlies and supports first-order morality through six dimensions. These include: the reasons for first-level morality support, the existing concepts repertoire, the subject of the moral evaluation, proper moral methods, the objectiveness of morality, and metaphysical conceptions. Some of these dimensions have a society-level organization, such as the conceptual repertoire for speaking about moralities in different languages, and some dimensions have an individual-level organization, such as the objectivity or relativity of first-order morality. Abend identifies two types of moral background that he describes as the Christian Merchant and the Standards of Practice. The Christian Merchant type can be characterized as an ethics of being, developing certain features of character and moral objectivism. The Standards of Practice is an ethics of doing, which sustains moral relativism and emphasizes moral actions with no particular attention to their motives. The Standards of Practice type has found its way into business schools' curricula as a business ethics discipline that believes morality can be taught by using case studies. This approach, while maintaining the principles of corporate social responsibility, can have negative effects on society and the economy. As long as corporations suggest that ethics pays and act morally only to make a profit, there is a risk that without the payoff, they will stop acting morally. This fact causes questions to surface, not only about corporate social responsibility and ethical behavior in business, but ultimately about values and the place of morality in society at large.	2.4
AZ31 alloy has been tested as a biodegradable material in the form of endomedullary implants in female Wistar rat femurs. In order to evaluate the accumulation of potentially toxic elements from the biodegradation of the implant, magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn) and fluorine (F) levels have been measured in different organs such as kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen and brain. Several factors that may influence accumulation have been taken into account: how long the implant has been in place, whether or not the bone is fractured, and the presence of an MgF2 protective coating on the implant. The main conclusions and the clinical relevance of the study have been that AZ31 endomedullary implants have a degradation rate of about 60% after 13 months, which is fully compatible with fracture consolidation. Neither bone fracture nor an MgF2 coating seems to influence the accumulation of trace elements in the studied organs. Aluminium is the only alloying element in this study that requires special attention. The increase in Al recovered from the sampled organs represents 3.95% of the amount contained in the AZ31 implant. Al accumulates in a statistically significant way in all the organs except the brain. All of this suggests that in long-term tests AZ31 may be a suitable material for osteosynthesis.	6.2
This paper discusses an effort to enhance the learning and affective experience of students in a laboratory module in metabolism through the use of the How People Learn framework, which is grounded in educational theory and research. The laboratory, which was a component of a systems physiology course in biomedical engineering, was modified such that some students had educational experiences informed by How People Learn principles while other students encountered a more traditional laboratory. Students were compared on a number of dimensions including knowledge acquisition, ability to use information to solve problems, transfer, and perceptions of their course experience. Several differences were observed between groups, with students in the How People Learn group out-performing controls on measures that required a deeper ability to use the material, but not differing in basic acquisition of information. Implications for the development of similar laboratories are discussed.	6.2
The feeling of synchrony is fundamental for most social activities and prosocial behaviors. However, little is known about the behavioral correlates of this feeling and its modulation by intergroup differences. We previously showed that the subjective feeling of synchrony in subjects involved in a mirror imitation task was modulated by objective behavioral measures, as well as contextual factors such as task difficulty and duration of the task performance. In the present study, we extended our methodology to investigate possible interindividual differences. We hypothesized that being in a romantic relationship or being a professional musician can modulate both implicit and explicit synchronization and the feeling of synchrony as well as the ability to detect synchrony from a third person perspective. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find significant differences between people in a romantic relationship and control subjects. However, we observed differences between musicians and control subjects. For the implicit synchrony (spontaneous synchronization during walking), the results revealed that musicians that had never met before spontaneously synchronized their movements earlier among themselves than control subjects, but not better than people sharing a romantic relationship. Moreover, in explicit behavioral synchronization tasks (mirror game), musicians reported earlier feeling of synchrony and had less speed errors than control subjects. This was in interaction with tasks difficulty as these differences appeared only in tasks with intermediate difficulty. Finally, when subjects had to judge synchrony from a third person perspective, musicians had a better performance to identify if they were present or not in the videos. Taken together, our results suggest that being a professional musician can play a role in the feeling of synchrony and its underlying mechanisms.	2.4
alpha-Linolenic acid (alpha LNA; 18 : 3n-3) is essential in the human diet, probably because it is the substrate for the synthesis of longer-chain, more unsaturated n-3 fatty acids, principally EPA (20 : 5n-3) and DHA (22 : 6n-3), which confer important biophysical properties on cell membranes and so are required for tissue function. The extent to which this molecular transformation occurs in man is controversial. The present paper reviews the recent literature on the metabolism of alpha LNA in man, including the use of dietary alpha LNA in beta-oxidation, recycling of carbon by fatty acid synthesis de novo and conversion to longer-chain PUFA. Sex differences in alpha LNA metabolism and the possible biological consequences are discussed. Increased consumption of EPA and DHA in fish oil has a number of well-characterised beneficial effects on health. The present paper also reviews the efficacy of increased alpha LNA consumption in increasing the concentrations of EPA and DHA in blood and cell lipid pools, and the extent to which such dietary interventions might be protective against CVD and inflammation. Although the effects on CVD risk factors and inflammatory markers are variable, where beneficial effects have been reported these are weaker than have been achieved from increasing consumption of EPA+DHA or linoleic acid. Overall, the limited capacity for conversion to longer-chain n-3 fatty acids, and the lack of efficacy in ameliorating CVD risk factors and inflammatory markers in man suggests that increased consumption of alpha LNA may be of little benefit in altering EPA+DHA status or in improving health outcomes compared with other dietary interventions.	6.2
The Good Behavior Game (GBG) is a classroom management strategy that uses an interdependent group-oriented contingency to promote prosocial behavior and decrease problem behavior. This meta-analysis synthesized single-case research (SCR) on the GBG across 21 studies, representing 1,580 students in pre-kindergarten through Grade 12. The TauU effect size across 137 phase contrasts was .82 with a confidence interval 95% CI = [0.78, 0.87], indicating a substantial reduction in problem behavior and an increase in prosocial behavior for participating students. Five potential moderators were examined: emotional and behavioral disorder (EBD) risk status, reinforcement frequency, target behaviors, GBG format, and grade level. Findings suggest that the GBG is most effective in reducing disruptive and off-task behaviors, and that students with or at risk for EBD benefit most from the intervention. Implications for research and practice are discussed.	2.4
Tilapia are generally known to be warm water fish widely distributed across the tropics. In particular, the maternal mouth brooding tilapia of the genera Saroterodon and Oreochromis have successfully adapted to a wide range of water bodies because of their plastic feeding habits and wide tolerance to varying environmental conditions (TREWAVAS 1982). The Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus occurs in almost all rivers and lakes of Ethiopia. It is the most important commercial fish, constituting over 60% of the commercial catch of the capture fishery in the country (REYNTJENS & WUDINEH 1998). Investigations on the fatty acid composition and lipid quality of fishes have been well documented mainly from marine and freshwater systems of the temperate regions (PUUSTINEN et al. 1985, AHLGREN et al. 1994, 1996). Most studies can be broadly examined either from an ecological point of view or in relation to human health. From the medical point of view, two of the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 omega 3) common in fish and fish oil have several biochemical effects on human metabolism. Fish oil rich in EPA and DHA can lower blood lipid and reduce the risk of getting coronary heart disease (MEDIORUS et al. 2007). From an ecological view point, it is important to know the origin of these important PUFA in fish and other animals at higher trophic levels. Information on the transfer of fatty acids from the lower trophic levels beginning from the phyto-plankton can be obtained by quantifying the levels of important fatty acids across the food chain. These fatty acids can serve as biomarkers to elucidate the transfer and conversion of individual fatty acids (NAPOLITANO 1999). Marine fish have been reported to have higher PUFA content than their freshwater counterparts (NAPOLITANO 1999); however, AHLGREN et al. (1994) and references therein think that the difference between marine and freshwater fish is related to other factors, such as feeding and type of fish, rather than the difference in salinity. In our earlier work we also found that tropical fish can be equally important to temperate fish in terms of PUFA content (ZENEBE et al. 1998a). Data on the fatty acid content of tropical fish are scarce and are mostly limited to fish from South America (CLEMENT & LOVELL 1994, ANDRADE et al. 1995). In our earlier study we reported the fatty acid composition of O. niloticus collected from the rift valley lakes located at lower altitudes (ZENEBE et al. 1998a, 1998b). In this study I report the fatty acid composition of the same fish taken mainly from the highland lakes located outside the Rift system of Ethiopia. This information will provide broad comparisons and more comprehensive data on the fatty acid contents of O. niloticus collected from the wild in Ethiopian lakes	6.2
The paper describes an approach for recognizing a person entering a room using only door accelerations. The approach analyzes the acceleration signal in time and frequency domain. For each domain two types of methods were developed: (i) feature-based - use features to describe the acceleration and then uses classification method to identify the person; (ii) signal-based - use the acceleration signal as input and finds the most similar ones in order to identify the person. The four methods were evaluated on a dataset of 1005 entrances recorded by 12 people. The results show that the time-domain methods achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the frequency-domain methods, with signal-based method achieving 86 % accuracy. Additionally, the four methods were combined and all 15 combinations were examined. The best performing combined method increased the accuracy to 90 %. The results confirm that it is possible to identify a person entering a room using the door's acceleration.	4.0
Image set representation and classification is an important problem in computer vision and pattern recognition area. It has been widely used in many computer vision applications. In this paper, a new image set representation and classification method has been proposed. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) a new image set representation model, called attributed covariate-relation graph (ACRG), has been proposed for image set representation and modeling. ACRG aims to represent image set with an attributed graph model which involves both image features and their spatial structure simultaneously. (2) A new graph data based sparse representation and classification method, called Graph Sparse Representation Classification (GSRC) has been proposed to achieve ACRG classification. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed ACRG representation and GSRC classification.	0.0
Berta et al's uncertainty principle in the presence of quantum memory (Berta et al 2010 Nat. Phys. 6 659) reveals uncertainties with quantum side information between the observables. In the recent important work of Coles and Piani (2014 Phys. Rev. A 89 022112), the entropic sum is controlled by the first and second maximum overlaps between the two projective measurements. We generalize the entropic uncertainty relation in the presence of quantum memory and find the exact dependence on all d largest overlaps between two measurements on any d-dimensional Hilbert space. Our bound is rigorously shown to be strictly tighter than previous entropic bounds in the presence of quantum memory, which have potential applications to quantum cryptography with entanglement witnesses and quantum key distributions.	0.3
Context-awareness is a key feature of Ambient Intelligence and future intelligent systems. In order to achieve context-aware behavior, applications must be able to detect context information, recognize situations and correctly decide on context-aware action. The representation of context information and the manner in which context is detected are central issues. Based on our previous work in which we used graphs to represent context and graph matching to detect situations, in this paper we present a platform that completely handles context matching, and does so in real time, in the background, by deferring matching to a component that acts incrementally, relying on previous matching results. The platform has been implemented and tested on an AAL-inspired scenario.	4.0
Despite extensive literature on parental monitoring, few studies have focused on father-youth solicitation in particular and none on solicitation via communication technology. To address this gap, this study explored the relationships between fathers' online and in-person solicitation of their adolescent and emerging adult children, and the youth's internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. A sample of US fathers (N = 158) reported on solicitation patterns, use of technology, and their child's behaviors. The results revealed differences by demographics, and an inverse trend between online and in-person solicitation in relation to internalizing, externalizing, and prosocial behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that online solicitation of information from the youth's friends was related to greater internalizing and externalizing, and less prosocial behavior. These findings support research suggesting that some forms of online solicitation may be interpreted by adolescents and emerging adults as intrusive and a violation of privacy.	2.4
In this paper, we analyze the security of a recent image encryption algorithm based on an improper fractional-order chaotic system suggested by Zhao et al. The fatal flaw in the cryptosystem is that the keystream generated depends on neither the plain-image nor the cipher-image. Another main issue with this algorithm is using the same key (the last key in the keystream) in all encryption equations. Based on these points, it is easy to recover the plain-image and the keystream by applying chosen plaintext attack in only one plain-image. Both mathematical analysis and experimental results confirm the feasibility of this attack. As a result, the cryptosystem under study is not suitable for cryptography.	0.3
Background: Wnt signaling plays an important role in development and maintenance of many organs and tissues. The most-studied secreted Wnt inhibitors are sclerostin (SOST), Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1), and secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP-1) which play important roles in bone turnover. The present study investigated the relationship between serum Wnt inhibitors and diseases with excessive ossification structures, such as ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and ossification of yellow ligament (OYL). Methods: Twenty-five patients with AS, DISH, OPLL, or OYL were recruited in this study. Fasting peripheral blood samples were collected from all patients and nine controls. Various biomarkers of bone turnover including osteocalcin (OSC), osteoprotegerin (OPG), SFRP-1, DKK-1, and SOST were investigated. Results: Our data showed that serum levels of OSC were higher, but Dkk-1 levels were lower in AS, DISH, OPLL, and OYL patients than those in the controls. Serum levels of SFRP-1 were significantly higher in DISH patients than those in the controls. Serum levels of SOST were significantly higher in DISH and OPLL patients than both levels in the controls. Serum levels of OPG were lower in AS patients than those in the controls. Serum levels of OSC were higher in the OPLL patients than those in the AS patients. Serum levels of DKK-1, SFRP-1, SOST, and OPG were not significantly different between the different disease groups. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, both OSC and DKK-1 levels are correlated with the clinical conditions associated with excessive ossification, indicating that blood OSC and DKK-1 levels may serve as diagnostic biomarkers for AS, DISH, OPLL, and OYL. These findings may also help discover potential drug therapies for management of these diseases in the future.	5.3
The theory of chaos and chaotic neural networks (CNNs) has been widely investigated in the past two decades. However, most researchers in this area have merely focused on how to make full use of CNNs to solve various problems in areas such as pattern recognition, classification, associate memory and cryptography. The philosophy of how to design a CNN is seldom discussed. In this paper, we present a general methodology for designing CNNs. By appropriately choosing a self-feedback mechanism, and also including coupling functions and an external stimulus, we have succeeded in proving that a dynamical system, defined by discrete time feedback equations, does, indeed, possess interesting chaotic properties. To the best of our knowledge, the results presented here are novel and pioneering.	0.3
Dynamic projection mapping for moving objects has attracted much attention in recent years. However, conventional approaches have faced some issues, such as the target objects being limited to rigid objects, and the limited moving speed of the targets. In this paper, we focus on dynamic projection mapping onto rapidly deforming non-rigid surfaces with a speed sufficiently high that a human does not perceive any misalignment between the target object and the projected images. In order to achieve such projection mapping, we need a high-speed technique for tracking non-rigid surfaces, which is still a challenging problem in the field of computer vision. We propose the Deformable Dot Cluster Marker (DDCM), a novel fiducial marker for high-speed tracking of non-rigid surfaces using a high-frame-rate camera. The DDCM has three performance advantages. First, it can be detected even when it is strongly deformed. Second, it realizes robust tracking even in the presence of external and self occlusions. Third, it allows millisecond-order computational speed. Using DDCM and a high-speed projector, we realized dynamic projection mapping onto a deformed sheet of paper and a T-shirt with a speed sufficiently high that the projected images appeared to be printed on the objects.	0.0
Bent functions are actively investigated for their various applications in cryptography, coding theory and combinatorial design. As one of their generalizations, negabent functions are also quite useful, and they are originally defined via nega- Hadamard transforms for boolean functions. In this paper, we look at another equivalent definition of them. It allows us to investigate negabent functions f on F-2n, which can be written as a composition of a univariate polynomial over F-2n and the trace mapping from F-2n to F-2. In particular, when this polynomial is a monomial, we call f a monomial negabent function. Families of quadratic and cubic monomial negabent functions are constructed, together with several sporadic examples. To obtain more interesting negabent functions in special forms, we also look at certain negabent polynomials. We obtain several families of cubic negabent functions by using the theory of projective polynomials over finite fields.	0.3
In 2014, FDU-PB-22 and FUB-PB-22, two novel synthetic cannabinoids, were detected in herbal blends in Japan, Russia, and Germany and were quickly added to their scheduled drugs list. Unfortunately, no human metabolism data are currently available, making it challenging to confirm their intake. The present study aims to identify appropriate analytical markers by investigating FDU-PB-22 and FUB-PB-22 metabolism in human hepatocytes and confirm the results in authentic urine specimens. For metabolic stability, 1 mu M FDU-PB-22 and FUB-PB-22 was incubated with human liver microsomes for up to 1 h; for metabolite profiling, 10 mu M was incubated with human hepatocytes for 3 h. Two authentic urine specimens from FDU-PB-22 and FUB-PB-22 positive cases were analyzed after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis. Metabolite identification in hepatocyte samples and urine specimens was accomplished by high-resolution mass spectrometry using information-dependent acquisition. Both FDU-PB-22 and FUB-PB-22 were rapidly metabolized in HLM with half-lives of 12.4 and 11.5 min, respectively. In human hepatocyte samples, we identified seven metabolites for both compounds, generated by ester hydrolysis and further hydroxylation and/or glucuronidation. After ester hydrolysis, FDU-PB-22 and FUB-PB-22 yielded the samemetabolite M7, fluorobenzylindole-3-carboxylic acid (FBI-COOH). M7 and M6 (hydroxylated FBI-COOH) were the major metabolites. In authentic urine specimens after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis, M6 and M7 also were the predominant metabolites. Based on our study, we recommend M6 (hydroxylated FBI-COOH) and M7 (FBI-COOH) as suitable urinary markers for documenting FDU-PB-22 and/or FUB-PB-22 intake.	6.2
The increasing population living in cities is leading to higher resource utilization, which strains the cities' ability to focus on sustainability. Adoption of different technologies can transform cities into smart cities that utilize energy in a more efficiently. This paper presents results from a technology assessment tool developed together with six mid-sized European cities. The main areas of focus have been evaluated based on the cities' priorities: transportation (both public and private) and consumers' perspectives on the use of smart electricity meters. The use of electric vehicles in Sweden, and a techno-economic evaluation of biogas-derived biomethane and electricity use in public transportation have been analyzed. The main conclusions show an overall higher efficiency for biogas-derived electricity use in electric buses; a need for higher consumer engagement through more detailed information provision for both increasing EV market penetration and electricity savings; and a need to establish detailed technology assessments for successful technology adoption in cities.

Green energy has gained significant research attention across the globe due to its ability to reduce environmental damage. However, for complete acceptance of green energy, only government regulations are not enough; the willingness to use green energy and contribute to the wellbeing of the environment should spring from within consumers. Such willingness may be developed by enhancing consumers' perceived value of green energy. However, in order to do so, it is necessary to assess existing levels of consumers' perceived value towards green energy. The present study develops a multidimensional green perceived value scale to measure existing levels of consumers' perceived value. The scale considers green perceived value as a multidimensional second order construct comprising functional value, social value, conditional value and emotional value dimensions. Such an attempt has not been made before which highlights the originality value of the present study. The scale can be used to assess consumers' perception towards green energy. Such information would help in formulating strategies that encourage consumers to voluntarily adopt green energy. The study also reveals that it is not only the financial aspects that lead consumers to decide on adoption of green energy; consumers are also driven by emotional and social considerations. Thus, policy makers could formulate pro-green energy programmes and mass messages that appeal to consumers' sense of responsibility to voluntarily adopt green energy without having to rely on financial incentives. Researchers could examine the considered dimensions of the scale further with respect to other constructs related to consumer behaviour. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
Intelligent (or smart) environments are usually developed for indoor applications, like ambient assisted independent living of seniors or handicapped persons in their homes, but users would appreciate intelligent support of various human activities also in outdoor spaces, e.g., in streets, forests, or elsewhere in open nature. Extensive usage of wireless sensor networks combined with cloud-based services and possible wearable equipment seems to be usable and efficient there. The purpose of the paper is to sketch a vision of an intelligent, knowledge rich outdoor environment, illustrated on the example of a ski resort. Such a knowledge rich outdoor environment (e.g., ski resort, or sea resort, among others) could be based on exploitation of sophisticated wireless sensor networks sending the data to an appropriate cloud with mobile access to all the necessary information.	4.0
The case study presented in this paper aimed at discovering opportunities for ambient intelligence and new interaction methods for a future remote crane-operating environment. The theoretical objective was to carry out an experience-driven research project in an industrial work context, and the practical objective was to create and evaluate a future-oriented science fiction prototype. The work was carried out in close co-operation with an industrial partner who was a domain expert in the field of crane industry. The aim was to focus on clearly defined user experience goals to which the industrial partner committed. The consequent immediate objective was to focus on two explicit experiences relating to 'Feeling of being motivated' and to 'Sense of community' that were placed at the core of the design investigations. These experiences were deliberated into a science fiction prototype entitled 'Remote operator's day in a future control center'. The science fiction prototype was further introduced to users by twofold means: as a plain, simple short story and through an interactive experience path. The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate how an emerging technology research of a new domain may employ science fiction prototyping method as a primary means of experience design investigations.	4.0
In explaining the prevalence of the overconfident belief that one is better than others, prior work has focused on the motive to maintain high self-esteem, abetted by biases in attention, memory, and cognition. An additional possibility is that overconfidence enhances the person's social status. We tested this status-enhancing account of overconfidence in 6 studies. Studies 1-3 found that overconfidence leads to higher social status in both short-and longer-term groups, using naturalistic and experimental designs. Study 4 applied a Brunswikian lens analysis (Brunswik, 1956) and found that overconfidence leads to a behavioral signature that makes the individual appear competent to others. Studies 5 and 6 measured and experimentally manipulated the desire for status and found that the status motive promotes overconfidence. Together, these studies suggest that people might so often believe they are better than others because it helps them achieve higher social status.	2.2
Purpose - Inverting electroheat problems involves synthesizing the electromagnetic arrangement of coils and geometries to realize a desired heat distribution. To this end two finite element problems need to be solved, first for the magnetic fields and the joule heat that the associated eddy currents generate and then, based on these heat sources, the second problem for heat distribution. This two-part problem needs to be iterated on to obtain the desired thermal distribution by optimization. Being a time consuming process, the purpose of this paper is to parallelize the process using the graphics processing unit (GPU) and the real-coded genetic algorithm, each for both speed and accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - This coupled problem represents a heavy computational load with long wait-times for results. The GPU has recently been demonstrated to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the finite element computations and cut down solution times. It has also been used to speedup the naturally parallel genetic algorithm. The authors use the GPU to perform coupled electroheat finite element optimization by the genetic algorithm to achieve computational efficiencies far better than those reported for a single finite element problem. In the genetic algorithm, coding objective functions in real numbers rather than binary arithmetic gives added speed and accuracy. Findings - The feasibility of the method proposed to reduce computational time and increase accuracy is established through the simple problem of shaping a current carrying conductor so as to yield a constant temperature along a line. The authors obtained a speedup (CPU time to GPU time ratio) saturating to about 28 at a population size of 500 because of increasing communications between threads. But this far better than what is possible on a workstation. Research limitations/implications - By using the intrinsically parallel genetic algorithm on a GPU, large complex coupled problems may be solved very quickly. The method demonstrated here without accounting for radiation and convection, may be trivially extended to more completely modeled electroheat systems. Since the primary purpose here is to establish methodology and feasibility, the thermal problem is simplified by neglecting convection and radiation. While that introduces some error, the computational procedure is still validated. Practical implications - The methodology established has direct applications in electrical machine design, metallurgical mixing processes, and hyperthermia treatment in oncology. In these three practical application areas, the authors need to compute the exciting coil (or antenna) arrangement (current magnitude and phase) and device geometry that would accomplish a desired heat distribution to achieve mixing, reduce machine heat or burn cancerous tissue. This process presented does it more accurately and speedily. Social implications - Particularly the above-mentioned application in oncology will alleviate human suffering through use in hyperthermia treatment planning in cancer treatment. The method presented provides scope for new commercial software development and employment. Originality/value - Previous finite element shape optimization of coupled electroheat problems by this group used gradient methods whose difficulties are explained. Others have used analytical and circuit models in place of finite elements. This paper applies the massive parallelization possible with GPUs to the inherently parallel genetic algorithm, and extends it from single field system problems to coupled problems, and thereby realizes practicable solution times for such a computationally complex problem. Further, by using GPU computations rather than CPU, accuracy is enhanced. And then by using real number rather than binary coding for object functions, further accuracy and speed gains are realized.	3.3
Different studies in the field of agricultural engineering have successfully related irrigation needs of plants with the percentage of green cover in crop images, by using simple allometric equations. Therefore, the problem of segmenting plants from soil in digital images becomes a key component of many water management systems. The development of automatic computer vision algorithms avoids slow and expensive procedures which require the supervision of human experts. In this sense, color analysis techniques have shown to yield the best results in accuracy and efficiency. This paper describes the design and development of a new web application with two different color segmentation techniques to estimate the percentage of green cover. The system allows a remote monitoring of crops, including functionality to upload images, analyze images, database storage, and graphical visualization of the results. An extensive experimental validation of this tool has been carried out on a lettuce crop of variety 'Little Gem'. The two segmentation methods - based on probabilistic color models using histograms, and clustering in the RGB space using the fuzzy c-means algorithm - are compared with respect to a manual segmentation technique which allows the human expert to validate the outcome of the process for each image. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of these two automatic methods as substitutes of the supervised process. The first method achieves a relative error below 2.4% in the obtained segmentation, while the second method has an error below 4.8%. Both techniques require less than 1 s of processing time in the server. Equations to compute the crop coefficient parameter are also included and validated for the same kind of crop.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.0
The practice of rainwater harvesting (RWH) is spreading rapidly in urban areas. This article studies the impact of a possible generalization of this practice for municipalities by proposing a new method to quantify the potential for potable water savings (PPWS) by using rainwater harvesting at the urban level. The proposed method is based on the adaptation of an already validated model assessing the PPWS for single buildings and the use of urban databases. Two concepts are introduced: (1) the building type that allows gathering all the buildings sharing common features; and (2) the equivalent building, which is used to assess the PPWS of a set of buildings (of a same building type) as if it were a single building. In the case of the municipality of Colombes (located in the suburbs of Paris), the method shows that the PPWS by using rainwater harvesting represents about 10% of the total potable water consumption: the residential buildings account for 64% of this potential. This method can be applied to other municipalities with a level of acceptable reliability with regard to the means to be implemented in terms of collecting information.	4.3
The aim of this study was to compare the data obtained using the new LIAISON (R) XL chemiluminescence system to search for HBsAg, antiHCV, and anti-HIV1-2/p24 Ag with those obtained using the VITROS system currently adopted by the Microbiology Unit of the Hospital of Legnano. Routine samples of patients who were referred by practitioners for the determination of HBsAg (1,000 samples) and/or anti-HCV (1,002 samples) and/or anti-HIV1-2 (995 samples) were simultaneously analyzed using both systems. The concordant positive and discordant samples were re-examined for confirmation by means of an HBsAg neutralization assay, anti-HCV immunoblot, or anti-HIV1-2 Western blot; HBV-DNA, or HCV-RNA or HIV-RNA was also sought in the discordant samples. Samples of patients known to be positive were tested (100 HBsAg positive, 100 anti-HCV positive, and 100 HIV 1-2 positive) as well throughout treatment, with viremia levels becoming undetectable after treatment. The HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV1-2 concordance between the two systems in routine series was respectively 99.8%, 98.5% and 99.7%, and 100% for all markers in samples known positive. The various molecular biology and confirmatory tests of the discordant samples were all negative (except for one anti-HCV positive sample). Measure of Cohen's kappa coefficient for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV gave K values of respectively 0.992, 0.946, and 0.980. In conclusion, the performance of the LIAISON (R) XL system in the routine laboratory determination for all three markers was comparable with that of the VITROS system.

Recently, some commercial websites collect browsing history and device information for use in services they provide. In this paper, we focused on font information that can be obtained via a web browser to determine what kind of software can be identified about a given device. According to existing research, it is possible to identify installed applications such as the Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Office using such font information. Thus, we have examined the fonts installed by operating systems (OS) and applications. Our results show that font information on a device can be used to identify installed applications and OS type and version.	0.4
Introduction. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)/Morbus Bechterew is a chronic inflammatory rheumatoid disease. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is involved in 4-35% of AS cases, and is correlated to the severity and extension of AS. Even though AS-caused TMJ ankylosis is exceptional, one should have high index of suspicion of TMJ ankylosis in AS for an early detection, because it is an extremely serious and disabling condition that causes problems with mastication, swallowing, digestion, speech, appearance and poor oral hygiene with heavy caries. Case report. A 54-year-old male patient sought medical attention at the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Clinic for Dentistry at the Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia, with the chief complaint of pain in the area of the upper left canine in the presence of limited mouth opening. The treatment plan consisted of upper left canine management and rehabilitation of the remaining teeth in the frontal and the premolar region in both, the upper and lower jaw. Even though molar region needed to be treated, unfortunately it was not in the treatment plan because ankylosis of TMJ made the treatment impossible. Conclusion. The patients with AS-caused TMJ ankylosis are considered a diagnostic challenge to routine dentistry. Accent should be given to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of the AS patients towards the favorable disease course and outcome.	5.3
In this paper, qualitative descriptors of images (QIDL(+)), 3D scenes (QSn3D) and movements (QMD) are proposed to be applied to ambient intelligent systems for: (i) improving human-computer interaction and (ii) enhancing their reasoning capabilities. These qualitative descriptors align with human perception and are used to produce narratives. Moreover, logic descriptions are obtained in first order logic and Prolog syntax, which enables straightforward reasoning capabilities. Finally, some use case tests carried out at Cartesium - the intelligent building at Spatial Cognition centre, at the University of Bremen are provided to show the flexibility and applicability of these qualitative descriptors. The results provided are discussed in terms of usability, logic framework used and integration of descriptors.	4.0
Human metabolism is investigated using several in vitro methods. However, the current methodologies are often expensive, tedious and complicated. Over the last decade, the combination of electrochemistry (EC) with mass spectrometry (MS) has a simpler and a cheaper alternative to mimic the human metabolism. This paper describes the development of a disposable microfluidic device with a screen-printed electrode (SPE) for monitoring phase II GSH reactions. The proposed chip has the potential to be used as a primary screening tool, thus complementing the current in vitro methods.	6.2
The aim of this study was to explore how Japanese young adults use social networking sites (SNS) and the social psychological factors that might impact their SNS security settings. A survey (N = 79) was employed to examine usage habits, actual account settings, risk perception and social cognition related to Twitter. Results indicate that there are discrepancies among privacy concerns, usage habits and actual privacy settings in Twitter users. More than 80% of respondents actually use public settings on their accounts, and a half of them disclose personal details in their profile despite believing that private information should not be disclosed on Twitter. Respondents also exhibited optimistic cognition and behavior regarding online privacy risks for themselves and negative stereotypes toward Twitter users whose accounts are protected. The possibility that these social cognitive factors have an impact on user privacy settings is discussed in this paper.	2.2
The provision of high quality urban water services, the assets of which are often conceptualised as 'blue infrastructure', is essential for public health and quality of life in the cities. On the other hand, parks, recreation grounds, gardens, green roofs and in general 'green infrastructure', provide a range of (urban) ecosystem services (including quality of life and aesthetics) and could also be thought of as inter alia contributors to the mitigation of floods, droughts, noise, air pollution and urban heat island (UHI) effects, improvement of biodiversity, amenity values and human health. Currently, these 'blue' and 'green' assets/infrastructure are planned to operate as two separate systems despite the obvious interactions between them (for example, low runoff coefficient of green areas resulting in reduction of stormwater flows, and irrigation of green areas by potable water in increasing pressure on water supply systems). This study explores the prospects of a more integrated 'blue-green' approach - tested at the scale of a household. Specifically, UWOT (the Urban Water Optioneering Tool) was extended and used to assess the potential benefits of a scheme that employed locally treated greywater along with harvested rainwater for irrigating a green roof. The results of the simulations indicated that the blue-green approach combined the benefits of both 'green' and 'blue' technologies/services and at the same time minimised the disadvantages of each when installed separately.	4.3
Medical education relies heavily on assessment formats that require raters to assess the competence and skills of learners. Unfortunately, there are often inconsistencies and variability in the scores raters assign. To ensure the scores from these assessment tools have validity, it is important to understand the underlying cognitive processes that raters use when judging the abilities of their learners. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive processes used by raters. Representative findings from the social judgment and decision making, cognitive psychology, and educational measurement literature will be used to enlighten the underpinnings of these rater-based assessments. Of particular interest is the impact judgments referred to as first impressions (or thin slices) have on rater-based assessments. These are judgments about people made very quickly and based on very little information. A narrative review will provide a synthesis of research in these three literatures (social judgment and decision making, educational psychology, and cognitive psychology) and will focus on the underlying cognitive processes, the accuracy and the impact of first impressions on rater-based assessments. The application of these findings to the types of rater-based assessments used in medical education will then be reviewed. Gaps in understanding will be identified and suggested directions for future research studies will be discussed.	2.2
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show a possibility of how new functions can be integrated in parts, created by the powder-bed-based 3D-printing technology. One big advantage of additive manufacturing technologies is the possibility to create function-integrated parts during the manufacturing process. This applies to mechanical functions like movable elements, thermodynamic functions like contour near cooling channels in a part as well as electrical functions like conductive lines and electrical components. Design/methodology/approach - A powder-bed-based 3D-printer is utilized to process polymethyl methacrylate ( PMMA) as base material. To enable new functionalities, an automated exhausting mechanism was implemented into the test system. The created cavities can be filled with new components or rather new materials. Findings - Three different approaches are shown in this paper. The first one was the integration of screw nuts to enhance bolted joints compared to threads, directly created in the part. The average tensile strength could be raised from 200 to 430 N/mm. The second approach was the integration of different reinforcement elements like carbon or metallic fibers. Here again a reinforcement of the tensile strength of approximately 27 per cent could be reached. The last approach shows a method to integrate conductive material as well as electrical components in a part to create simple electrical circuits. Originality/value - The paper demonstrates how to extend an additive powder-bed-based technology with a powder-exhausting mechanism. The possibilities of this technology are illustrated by three examples, integrating mechanical as well as electrical functions in a part.	1.2
Background: Through mounting genetic investigations, it has been established that IL12B and IL23R gene single nucleotide polymorphisms have significant associations with autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-12/IL-23 pathway plays a pivotal role in etiopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), suggested by studies both in patients and animal models. Methods: In a case-control study, 145 MS patients and 200 healthy subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms in IL12B and IL23R genes using Real-Time PCR allelic discrimination approach. Additionally, quantitative analysis of mRNA expression of IL12B in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from patients and controls was conducted through Real-Time PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay. Results: The rs6887695 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IL12B gene showed an association with susceptibility to MS. GG genotype of this variation was more frequent in patients. mRNA expression of IL12B was upregulated in patients. Expression of IL12B mRNA in both MS patients collectively and those with GG genotype for rs6887695 SNP correlated negatively with onset age of MS patients. Conclusions: The GG genotype of rs6887695 SNP in IL12B gene plays a role in etiopathogenesis of MS.	5.3
Human social perception, communication, and interaction all require the efficient analysis and representation of person-related information. Faces or voices convey a large variety of socially relevant information, including a person's identity, emotions, gender, age, attractiveness, ethnic group, or focus of attention. However, perceptual mechanisms for processing such complex social stimuli have only recently become the focus of more systematic research. This development was arguably facilitated (1) by the availability of sophisticated stimulus manipulation techniques (e.g., image-, video-, and voice-morphing, caricaturing, and averaging) allowing researchers to create completely naturalistic person stimuli in which perceptual social cues are nevertheless under precise experimental control, and (2) by the availability of methods from the cognitive and social neurosciences. Here we review the current status of the field of person perception. In doing so, we discuss selected examples of highly active areas of research and show how person perception currently has developed into a central topic within psychological research. Evidence is emerging to suggest that perceptual social cues in faces or voices are not only spontaneously used to promote first impressions about people, but also that such impressions can show a degree of validity, suggesting that faces or voices can be seen as windows to the person behind. Accordingly, we argue that progress in other fields of social cognition that deal with real or virtual agents (e.g., theory of mind research, social categorization, human decision-making) will be enhanced by considering more strongly the influences of perceptual facial or vocal person information.	2.2
Snow load strength, excellent ventilation, strong end-wall construction, structure mobility, and rainwater harvesting are high tunnel features important to urban growers; rural farmers are interested in the same features for their high tunnels. Working to include these features in a single structure for urban growers has led to innovations that benefit both urban and rural farmers; rainwater harvesting, a mobile ready base frame, all weather retractable dome(s), and a two person installation method are a few of the innovations that have been developed in Cleveland, Ohio. These innovations have been applied on small farms throughout Northeast Ohio.A serious concern for the environmental and human health is represented by the increasing copper (Cu) occurrence in agricultural soils andwaters, because of the possible food contamination and bioaugmentation along the trophic chain. The request for the decontamination of different matrices with an environmentally sustainable technology as the phytoremediation should be addressed by selecting plant materials with improved pollutant tolerance and removal capability. With this purpose, plants of the hybrid poplar clone Monviso (Populus x generosa A. Henry x P. nigra L.) were grown in growth chamber under hydroponics and exposed to excess Cu concentrations (T-1, 75 mu M Cu; T-2, 150 mu M Cu), selected as about 5 and 10 times higher than those allowed by the Italian regulation on water use. Results evidenced a notable Cu tolerance by poplar plants, particularly at the lowest Cu concentration. At organ level, the root system was themost affected by Cu treatment, especially in T(2-)exposed plants. Copper determinations revealed that the metal was mostly bioaccumulated in the roots, with a limited amount reaching the shoots. Chlorophyll content and fluorescence analyses confirmed the visible symptoms in leaves, highlighting a good physiological status in T-1-exposed plants. Contrarily, an impairment of themain processes associated to photosynthesis was observed in T-2-exposed plants also by gas exchange measurements. Remarkably, the Cu content analysis of the spiked water solutions revealed that poplar plants succeeded in removing almost the 50% of the total Cu amount added. These results strengthen the evidence that poplar plants represent a useful eco-friendly bio-tool for the decontamination of metal polluted waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.3
With rapid urbanization, highly accurate and semantically rich virtualization of building assets in 3D become more critical for supporting various applications, including urban planning, emergency response and location-based services. Many research efforts have been conducted to automatically reconstruct building models at city-scale from remotely sensed data. However, developing a fully-automated photogrammetric computer vision system enabling the massive generation of highly accurate building models still remains a challenging task. One the most challenging task for 3D building model reconstruction is to regularize the noises introduced in the boundary of building object retrieved from a raw data with lack of knowledge on its true shape. This paper proposes a data-driven modeling approach to reconstruct 3D rooftop models at city-scale from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The focus of the proposed method is to implicitly derive the shape regularity of 3D building rooftops from given noisy information of building boundary in a progressive manner. This study covers a full chain of 3D building modeling from low level processing to realistic 3D building rooftop modeling. In the element clustering step, building-labeled point clouds are clustered into homogeneous groups by applying height similarity and plane similarity. Based on segmented clusters, linear modeling cues including outer boundaries, intersection lines, and step lines are extracted. Topology elements among the modeling cues are recovered by the Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) technique. The regularity of the building rooftop model is achieved by an implicit regularization process in the framework of Minimum Description Length (MDL) combined with Hypothesize and Test (HAT). The parameters governing the MDL optimization are automatically estimated based on Min-Max optimization and Entropy-based weighting method. The performance of the proposed method is tested over the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed method can robustly produce accurate regularized 3D building rooftop models.	0.0
Visual tracking, which has been widely used in many vision fields, has been one of the most active research topics in computer vision in recent years. However, there are still challenges in visual tracking, such as illumination change, object occlusion, and appearance deformation. To overcome these difficulties, a reliable point assignment (RPA) algorithm based on wavelet transform is proposed. The reliable points are obtained by searching the location that holds local maximal wavelet coefficients. Since the local maximal wavelet coefficients indicate high variation in the image, the reliable points are robust against image noise, illumination change, and appearance deformation. Moreover, a Kalman filter is applied to the detection step to speed up the detection processing and reduce false detection. Finally, the proposed RPA is integrated into the tracking-learning-detection (TLD) framework with the Kalman filter, which not only improves the tracking precision, but also reduces the false detections. Experimental results showed that the new framework outperforms TLD and kernelized correlation filters with respect to precision, f-measure, and average overlap in percent.	0.0
For the characteristic of compact structure, low inertia, high rigidness and accuracy, parallel mechanisms are worthwhile to be popularized in the field of agricultural robotization, especially in situations that require precise movement in limited space. Focusing on the harvesting task of strawberries in ridge culture, a 4-PPPR robot manipulator with three translational DOF and one rotational DOF is devised in this paper. A type synthesis method of G(F) set theory is used to design its topology structure in 3D space. Compared to traditional machine design methods, this synthesis method allow one to decide the manipulator's configuration in a Topdown logic initially from the appointed features of the manipulator's moving platform. A software simulation is carried out to demonstrate this mechanism can meet all the movement requirements by driving the four active joints allocated on the fixed platform.	3.3
The determination of sialic acids (SIAs) has recently gained interest because of their potential role as markers of inflammatory disorders or chronic diseases. Hydrolysis of conjugated derivatives, solid-phase extraction (SPE) and derivatization steps constitute sample preparation prior to insertion of the analytical sample into a mu-liquid chromatograph-laser induced fluorescence (mu-LC-LIF) detector in the present method for the determination of two representative SIAs of human metabolism. Ultrasound-accelerated hydrolysis released free SIAs, which were efficiently concentrated in a dynamic manner using a lab-on-valve (LOV) module that allows automation of SPE for preconcentration and cleanup. This step was on-line connected with DMB-labeling of SIAs (derivatization), which was shortened from 180 min required with the conventional heating method to 20 min with ultrasound assistance. Individual separation of the target analytes was achieved within 20 min by mu-LC, while LIF detection endowed the overall method with high sensitivity. The LODs and LOQs provided by the method ranged 0.1-0.8 ng mL(-1) and 0.4-1.0 ng mL(-1) (between 0.1-0.8 pg and 0.4-1.0 pg expressed as on-column amount), respectively. High efficiency for interferents removal by SPE enabled the application of the method to four different biofluids serum, urine, saliva and breast milk for the determination of the target metabolites.

Purpose: Combined modality therapy is a mainstay option for thoracic malignancies and head and neck cancers. The integration of different strategies is based on the multidisciplinary approach of modern clinical oncology. Radiation oncologists have to be educated, trained, and updated to provide state-of-the-art care to cancer patients and thus educational meetings are crucial. Methods: The Italian Association of Radiation Oncology Young Members Working Group (AIRO Giovani) organized its 8th national meeting, focused on combination therapy in lung, esophageal, and head and neck cancer (with a specific focus on larynx-preservation strategies for larynx/hypopharynx tumors), involving young professionals working in Italy. The meeting was addressed to young radiation oncologists, presenting state-of-the-art knowledge, based on the latest evidence in this field. We performed a review of the current literature based on the highlights of the Congress. Results: The multimodality approach of head and neck and thoracic malignancies includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, but also has to take into account new information and data coming from basic and translational research and including molecular biology, genetics, and immunology. All these aspects are crucial for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer and esophageal, esophagogastric junction, and larynx/hypopharynx malignancies. The integration of different treatments in the clinical decision-making process to combine therapies is crucial. Conclusions: Combination therapy has proved to be a consolidated approach in these specific oncologic settings, highlighting the importance of multimodality management in modern clinical oncology. Dedicated meetings on specific topics are helpful to improve knowledge and skills of young professionals in radiation oncology.	6.0
ScopeProteins constitute an important part of the human diet, but understanding of the effects of different dietary protein sources on human metabolism is sparse. We aimed to elucidate diet-induced metabolic changes through untargeted urinary metabolomics after four weeks of intervention with lean-seafood or nonseafood diets. It is shown that lean-seafood intake reduces urinary excretion of metabolites involved in mitochondrial lipid and energy metabolism possibly facilitating a higher lipid catabolism in healthy subjects. MethodsIn a randomized controlled trial with crossover design, 20 healthy subjects consumed two balanced diets that varied in main protein sources for 4 weeks. Morning spot urine samples were collected before and after each intervention period. Untargeted metabolomics based on H-1 NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS analyses were applied to characterize the urinary metabolic response to the interventions. ResultsThe lean-seafood diet period reduced the urinary level of l-carnitine, 2,6-dimethylheptanoylcarnitine, and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, relative to the nonseafood period. The dietary analysis revealed that the higher urinary level of trimethylamine-N-oxide after the lean-seafood diet period and guanidinoacetate and 3-methylhistidine after the nonseafood diet period was related to the endogenous content of these compounds in the diets. ConclusionsOur data reveal that 4 weeks of lean-seafood intake reduces urinary excretion of metabolites involved in mitochondrial lipid and energy metabolism possibly facilitating a higher lipid catabolism in healthy subjects after the lean-seafood intake.	6.2
Past research has shown that the gender typicality of applicants' faces affects leadership selection irrespective of a candidate's gender: A masculine facial appearance is congruent with masculine-typed leadership roles, thus masculine-looking applicants are hired more certainly than feminine-looking ones. In the present study, we extended this line of research by investigating hiring decisions for both masculine-and feminine-typed professional roles. Furthermore, we used eye tracking to examine the visual exploration of applicants' portraits. Our results indicate that masculine-looking applicants were favored for the masculine-typed role (leader) and feminine-looking applicants for the feminine-typed role (team member). Eye movement patterns showed that information about gender category and facial appearance was integrated during first fixations of the portraits. Hiring decisions, however, were not based on this initial analysis, but occurred at a second stage, when the portrait was viewed in the context of considering the applicant for a specific job.	2.2
This paper introduces a comparative study on the design of aerospace actuators concerning induction motor and permanent-magnet motor technologies. In the analysis undertaken, the two candidate configurations are evaluated in terms of both their electromagnetic and thermal behaviors in a combined manner. On a first step, the basic dimensioning of the actuators and their fundamental operational characteristics are determined via a time-stepping finite-element analysis. The consideration of the thermal robustness of the proposed motor configurations is integrated in the design procedure through the appropriate handling of their respective constraints. As a result, all comparisons are carried out on a common thermal evacuation basis. On a second step, a single objective optimization procedure is employed, considering several performance and efficiency indexes using appropriate weights. Manufacturing and construction-related costs for both investigated topologies are considered by employing specific penalty functions. The impact of the utilized materials is also examined. The resultant motor designs have been validated through manufactured prototypes, illustrating their suitability for aerospace actuation.	3.3
We study the energy dispatch of power distribution networks (PDNs) coupled with urban transportation networks. The electricity demand at each charging/swapping facility is influenced by the arrival rates and charging requests of electric vehicles, which further depends on the spatial distribution of traffic flows over the entire transportation system. We consider the impact of the road congestion on route choices of vehicles from a system-level perspective. The traffic flow pattern in steady state is characterized by the Wardrop user equilibrium. We consider the PDN load perturbation caused by the traffic demand uncertainty, and propose a robust dispatch method that maintains the feasibility of an alternating current power flow constraints. By applying the convex relaxation to nonlinear branch power flow equations, the proposed model yields a two-stage robust convex optimization problem with an implicit uncertainty set. Moreover, a decomposition framework is proposed, in which the first phase determines the uncertainty set of electricity demand by solving two traffic assignment problems associated with the extreme scenarios, and the second phase solves a two-stage robust second-order cone program following a delayed constraint generation framework. Several issues regarding the scalability and conservatism are elaborated. Case studies corroborate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method.	1.0
The earlier remote password authenticationschemes required a service providing server to authenticate a legitimate userfor remote login. However, the traditional schemes are not useful in multi-server architecture because of multiple user ids and passwords. In this paper, we present a remote password authentication scheme for multi-server architecture that can be robust and improved network security. This password authentication system is a trainedclassification system based on SVM. In this scheme, the users only remember ownidentity and password and own choices for the various server login which he filled during registration where the user can choose hispassword at will. Furthermore, this system does not require having any overhead of password or verification table and is very dynamic in nature and can also withstand the replay attack and masquerading.	0.2
This paper proposes a combined numerical and analytical approach for magnetic vibration analysis of a new dc-excited multitoothed switched reluctance (MSR) machine. First, the machine design is artfully to incorporate the dc-excited winding into the MSR topology, hence breeding a new flux controllable, high-torque, low-torque ripple, and doubly salient magnetless machine. Then, the finite-element-method is used to calculate the machine force and torque. A series of analytical equations are formulated to calculate the magnetic vibration parameters of the proposed machine. The analysis process and the corresponding results are given to verify the validity of the proposed approach for magnetic vibration analysis of the new machine.	3.3
Product related service is a key element of any service-oriented manufacturing system. The paper presents methods to capture standardization knowledge in the European Integrated Project Manufacturing SErvice Engineering (MSEE), with the goal to initiate development of standards in the domain of manufacturing engineering services. For this purpose, a project internal survey has been performed to identify areas of potential standardization that can lead to future standards. With the survey, a coordinated follow-up within the project and subsequent external promotion are foreseen. An early involvement in the standardisation process is explored, since the normal standardisation process usually starts after completion of a development project and due to lack of funding is not any more supported by the developers.	3.2
In the paper we describe the control electronics for an industrial test system based on a low cost PLC. The developed system is a hydraulic pulse system and it generates series of high pressure hydraulic pulses (max. 200bar) and is based on pneumatic-hydraulic circuits. We describe requirements, an overall concept of the embedded control system, user interface, security features and network connectivity. In the description of the software solution we describe implementation of hierarchical ordered program threads (multithreaded program) and main control state machine. At the conclusion, we describe the calibration method of the system and calibration curves, we present the schematic diagram and a photo of a functional prototype of the system.	3.3
Appraisal research has traditionally focused on negative emotions but has not addressed issues concerning the relationships between several positive emotions and appraisals in daily life and the extent to which co-occurrence of positive emotions can be explained by overlap in appraisals. Driven by a priori hypotheses on appraisal-emotion relationships, this study investigated 12 positive emotions and 13 appraisal dimensions using Ecological Momentary Assessment. The results provide strong evidence that positive emotions and appraisals correlate significantly in daily life. Importantly, we found that the positive emotions' overlap on theoretically relevant, as compared to irrelevant, appraisals was stronger and more predictive of their co-occurrence. Furthermore, appraisal overlap on theoretically relevant appraisals predicted the co-occurrence of positive emotions even when the appraisal of pleasantness was excluded, indicating that positive emotions do not co-occur just by virtue of their shared valence. Our findings affirmed and refined the appraisal profiles of positive emotions and underscore the importance of appraisals in accounting for the commonality and differences among positive emotions.	2.4
In a node replication attack, an adversary creates replicas of captured sensor nodes in an attempt to control information that is reaching the base station or, more generally, compromise the functionality of the network. In this work, we develop fully distributed and completely decentralized schemes to detect and evict multiple imposters in mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs). The proposed schemes not only quarantines these malicious nodes but also withstand collusion against collaborating imposters trying to blacklist legitimate nodes of the network. Hence the completeness and soundness of the protocols is guaranteed. Our protocols are coupled with extensive mathematical and experimental results, proving the viability of our proposals, thus making them fit for realistic mobile sensor network deployments.

In this paper, a novel compact high-voltage (HV) test system based on a magnetically controlled resonant transformer (MCRT) is proposed. This system is used to perform a power-frequency HV on-site voltage withstanding test. First, the basic principle of the MCRT is introduced. Next, a Fourier analysis based on the equivalent magnetic and electrical circuits of the MCRT is described. This analysis provides a design reference for the basic MCRT parameters. In addition, a finite-element model was constructed to verify the MCRT design. Finally, an MCRT prototype was designed to verify the effectiveness of the test system. Compared with the traditional HV test systems, the proposed test system in this paper has the advantages of compact structure, stable secondary voltage, and wide reactance adjustment range.	1.2
The main objective of this paper is to develop a new technique for detecting turn-to-turn short-circuit faults in one or two stator phases of an induction motor. Hence, modeling a turn-to-turn short-circuit fault in more than one phase and a phase-to-ground fault is the first novelty of this paper for calculating phase currents under faulty conditions. This strategy uses the extracted features from the corresponding three-phase current pattern in 3-D space. Identification of faulty phases and of the severity of the fault is the outcome of this technique. This technique is also capable of detecting a phase-to-ground fault. This method just requires current sensors that are available in most drive systems to provide good controllability, and details of the machine design are not necessary. Experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting and locating phase/phases under different faults and load conditions.	3.3
Conventional methods to verify gears are based on manual measurement instruments, such as vernier caliper gauges, gear pitch micrometers, profilometers, among others. The use of these instruments is widely described in technical literature, while in the actual industrial arena the coordinate measurement machines (CMM) are commonly used to obtain, with the appropriate software, all the parameters including the tooth profile. Commercial software for measuring gears with a CMM is usually based on continuous touch of teeth's flanks. In the educational centres is still common to find single-point probing point to point touch machines. To transform them into continuous touch machines, new software and accessories are required and costs can be excessive for instructional purposes. This paper presents the geometrical and mathematical principles to develop a software application for measuring gears and describes its implementation using general-purpose spreadsheet software. For this purpose, the conventionally used software of the CMM is supported by a spreadsheet that calculates the probe positions and direction of measurement. The communication between the spreadsheet and the CMM software is established by ASCII files. At the end of this process, the spreadsheet displays the measurement results, thanks to its graphical and computing power, making possible to improve the learning process of students or training professionals.

In this work we present the functional specifications, architecture and implementation of the HERMOPHILOS web-based system developed to auto-mate and accelerate the accessible eTextbooks' production, workflow management, and delivery in an a higher education environment. We describe the redesign of the relative manual procedures and we show how HERMOPHILOS makes things easier and faster for the print-disabled students, as well as for the personnel involved. The web services of HERMOPHILOS include user sign up, user authentication, user rights management, students' accessible textbooks re-quests, digital textbook requests to publishers, requests' progress monitoring, original digital textbook copy submission, scanning, OCR, version and archive management, copyright protection, distribution, and digital content usage statistics. Implementation specifications included support for all browsers, operating systems, and mobile devices, accessible user interfaces (WCAG 2.0 AA), and advanced encryption and security policies. The HERMOPHILOS system sup-ports multiple formats for eTextbooks: plain text (.txt), rich text (.rtf), accessible markup (.xml, .xhtml, and .html), large print (.doc), audio books (.mp3), DAISY 2&3 (text only or full text - full audio), Braille (.brf or .brl), MS-Word (.docx), portable document format (.pdf) and LaTex (.tex). Paperwork was dramatically reduced, and the need for students' visits to the accessibility office was eliminated. The results show that, compared to the traditional procedure, the HERMOPHILOS workflow management system reduced the overall production and delivery time by 47 %.	0.4
A novel microbial fuel cell (MFC) was developed to enhance simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) by employing electrons from the anode. The cathode chamber of the reactor consisted of a membrane aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) which was made of an electroconductivity aerated membrane. The maximum power density of 4.20 +/- 0.12 W m(-3) was obtained at a current density of 4.10 +/- 0.11 A m(-2) (external resistance = 10 Omega). Compared with an open-circuit system, the removal rates of NI4+-N and TN were improved by 9.48 +/- 0.33% and 19.80 +/- 0.84%, respectively, which could be ascribed to the electrochemical denitrification. The anode (chemical oxygen demand, COD) and cathode (NO3-) chambers reached the maximum coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of 40.67 +/- 1.05% and 42.84 +/- 1.14%, respectively. It suggested that the electroconductivity MABR has some advantages in controlling aeration intensity, thus improving SND and CEs. Overall, EAM-MFC could successfully generate electricity from wastewater whilst showing high capacity for removing nitrogen at a low COD/N ratio of 2.8 +/- 0.07 g COD g(-1) N. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

With the tremendous growth of Internet, large amounts of data are generated and create big challenges for nowadays computing technologies and systems. However, on the other hand, it also sheds new light on the areas of data analytics and mining which enables uncovering the patterns and laws beneath the big data. In recent years, big data analytics have been successfully applied to many areas, such as E-commerce, Healthcare, and Industry. As the same time, security analytics based on big data also receive great attention from both academic and industry. In this paper, we give a comprehensive sketch of techniques about the applications of big data in network security analytics. The existing research works are classified into three types: supervised, unsupervised and hybrid approaches. Then we elaborate the technical issues of the three kinds of approaches and compare their advantages and disadvantages. Finally we outlook the potentials and research directions in the future.	0.2
Development of molecular scale electronics stimulates the search for new functional materials and compounds. One of the promising directions of further growth within this field is bioelectronics, which assumes the use of electron transfer (ET)-mediating properties of bio-related compounds. Because of the structural and functional versatility, peptides and proteins are particularly well suited to perform as single-molecule-based elements of circuits or sensing devices. In this review, it is demonstrated that purposely designed systems such as molecular junctions are excellent platforms for the studies of ET properties of peptides and proteins at nanoscale level. Using experimental approach based on scanning probe microscopy, individual molecules can be directly wired between two metallic contacts, and their conductance can be determined. ET behavior of the peptides and proteins can be analyzed in terms of their applicability as molecular wires, switches, diodes and elements of sensing devices. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	1.2
Network intrusion attempts have been on the rise recently. Researchers have shown an increased interest in assessing the security situation for entire network instead of single asset. A considerable amount of assessment models have been designed. However, there is a lack of solid and standard guidelines to define the importance of network asset. In addition, based on our knowledge, no research has been found that adequately covered the cost factor in the assessment model. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to propose a cost-sensitive entropy-based network security situation assessment model. With the aid of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the model can quantitatively determine the importance of assets in the network by considering the tangible and intangible criteria. To verify the performance of proposed model, a simulation of National Advanced IPv6 Centre (NAv6)'s network environment has been setup. The simulation results regarding security situation in particular time-interval are promising. Hence, the proposed model is able to provide network administrator a more reliable reference before any further decision making for the organization's network.	0.2
DNS (Domain name System) is one of the most prevalent protocols on modern networks and is essential for the correct operation of many network activities including the malicious operation. Monitoring the DNS traffic is an effective method to detect malicious activities. In this paper, we proposed an approach to detect malicious domains by analyzing massive mobile web traffic data. We used multiple features to classify, including the textual features and the traffic statistics features of domains and presented three typical classifiers to compare the classifying effect of each. Spark framework is leveraged to speed up the calculation of a large-scale DNS traffic. The efficiency of our system makes us believe the approach can help a lot in the field of network security.	0.2
Diesel exhaust is known to induce tumours in animals. Of the compounds found in diesel exhaust 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) is particularly a powerful mutagen. Recently we showed that 3-NBA is genotoxic in vivo in rats by forming specific DNA adducts derived from nitroreduction. In this study a panel of genetically engineered V79 Chinese hamster cell lines expressing various human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP3A4) and/or human NADPH:CYP oxidoreductase (CYPOR) was used to identify CYP enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of 3-NBA. We analyzed the formation of specific DNA adducts by P-32-postlabelling after exposing cells to 1 muM 3-NBA. A similar pattern with a total of four distinct 3-NBA-DNA adducts was found in all cells, identical to those detected previously in DNA from rats treated with 3-NBA in vivo. Total adduct levels ranged from 75 to 132 using nuclease P1 and from 103 to 220 adducts per 10(8) nucleotides, using butanol enrichment. Comparison of DNA binding between different V79MZ derived cells revealed that human CYPOR and CYP3A4 were involved in the metabolic activation of 3-NBA. Furthermore, dose-dependent high adduct levels were detected after exposure to 0.01, 0.1 or 1 muM 3-NBA in the subclone V79NH which exhibits high activities of nitroreductase and N, O-acetyltransferase. Our results suggest that nitroreduction is the major pathway in the human bioactivation of 3-NBA. Moreover, acetylation of the initially formed N-hydroxy arylamine intermediates may contribute to the high genotoxic potential of 3-NBA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.2
Current day networks operate on multiple hardware devices assisted by numerous numbers of operating systems. Systems may have vulnerabilities. These are explored and then exploited. Among the overall malicious activity countries, India ranked third after US and China. This paper has made an attempt to explore possibility of quantifying various probabilities. Cyber system can be modeled in different ways. There are various attack vectors that make cyber network vulnerable. A compromised employee is an insider to any network and contributes significantly to the network vulnerability. Keeping in mind various random variables that affect the safety of Cyber Random Space, there may be a need to quantify the probability associated with different cyber exploitation related activities.	0.4
This paper presents the parameter identification of an equivalent circuit-based proton-exchange membrane fuel cell model. This model is represented by two electrical circuits, of which one reproduces the fuel cell's output voltage characteristic and the other its thermal characteristic. The output voltage model includes activation, concentration, and ohmic losses, which describe the static properties, while the double-layer charging effect, which delays in fuel and oxygen supplies, and other effects provide the model's dynamic properties. In addition, a novel thermal model of the studied Ballard's 1.2-kW Nexa fuel cell is proposed. The latter includes the thermal effects of the stack's fan, which significantly improve the model's accuracy. The parameters of both, the electrical and the thermal, equivalent circuits were estimated on the basis of experimental data using an evolution strategy. The resulting parameters were validated by the measurement data obtained from the Nexa module. The comparison indicates a good agreement between the simulation and the experiment. In addition to simulations, the identified model is also suitable for usage in real-time fuel cell emulators. The emulator presented in this paper additionally proves the accuracy of the obtained model and the effectiveness of using an evolution strategy for identification of the fuel cell's parameters.	1.2
This cross-cultural study examines, first, whether 18-month-olds' helping behavior differs between cultures and, second, the way in which caregivers' socialization goals and practices are associated with toddlers' helping behavior. Helping behavior was assessed in three out-of-reach tasks with increasing motivational demands. We found that Delhi toddlers (n = 32) helped more than Munster toddlers (n = 60). Regarding socialization practices (SPs), Delhi mothers, compared with Munster mothers, reported to provide more opportunities to help in the family context and to praise less when fostering toddlers' prosocial behavior. Furthermore, Delhi mothers reported to use more punitive practices after their children did not follow a helping request. On an intra-cultural level, we found that helping was positively associated with punitive practices in the Delhi sample, whereas helping was negatively related with punitive practices and providing opportunities to help in Munster. On the basis of these results, we first propose that culture affects toddlers' helping behavior from the time of emergence during the second year. Second, we propose that the culture-specific conceptions of prosocial behavior influence which SPs parents use, which, in turn, may influence children's motivation underlying early prosocial behavior.	2.4

This paper presents a novel diagnosis method based on error voltage for 1GBTs open-circuit faults in dual-loop controlled voltage-source inverters. The phase voltage changes when open-circuit faults occur, and then there are error voltages of each phase which can be calculated directly by control algorithm with phase voltages and their corresponding flexible references both available from the main control system. Therefore, the proposed diagnosis method requires no additional sensors or electrical circuits to detect open-circuit faults, further with the features of fast diagnostic time, being suitable for various load conditions, strong robustness against false alarms and being easily inserted to the existing control algorithms as a subroutine. The experimental results are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	1.2
Many senior citizens are keeping in touch with modern times and put modern technologies to good use. They attempt to adapt to this era and don't avoid computers or smart devices. Such senior citizens often also educate themselves further in ICT, but are not immune to troubles that come hand in hand with ICT, or even psychological issues that stem from learning new skills in high age. Many even reconsider, asking themselves if all the effort is worth the outcome. Courses they attend might not be the best suited for them and can be very different from one another. Taught operating systems, teacher's individual attitude, accessibility of the course itself and learning environment have huge impact on both senior's attitude and quality of gained skills. This article aims to describe areas and issues senior citizens feel are most limiting in their access to quality education in ICT, and how they are tackled. The results come from a qualitative research among a selected sample of senior citizens that took part in our ICT courses. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	0.4
Background: Infections are usually involved in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis (SpA). Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a component of the innate immune system with an important role in microbial defense.Objective: To study the prevalence of MBL deficiency in SpA patients as well as its influence in the clinical profile of these diseases.Methods: We studied 89 SpA patients and 89 healthy individuals, paired for age and gender. MBL serum levels were measured by ELISA test. Individuals with levels 100 ng/mL were considered deficient. SpA patients had determination of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)-CRP, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and review of their clinical profile.Results: SpA patients had MBL levels ranging from 100 to 4100 ng/mL (median = 375 ng/mL); controls levels ranged from 100 to 4703 ng/mL (median = 1204 ng/mL; p < 0.0001). The prevalence of MBL deficiency was 27/89 (30.3%) in SpA patients and 12/89 (13.5%) in controls, with p = 0.01; OR = 2.5 (95% IC = 1.2-5.3). No association/correlation was found between MBL levels with BASDAI, BASFI, age at disease onset, ASDAS-CRP, ESR, CRP, presence of uveitis, HLAB27, peripheral arthritis, or SpA subtype (all p = NS).Conclusion: MBL levels may be linked with the occurrence of SpA but do not influence its phenotype.	5.3
Natural disasters constitute a persistent threat to economic welfare in many places, particularly in developing countries. Not only can disasters transform living circumstances, but we provide evidence here that they can lead to important changes in individual preferences. In a series of experiments that we conducted in rural Thailand, we find that the 2004 tsunami led to substantial longlasting increases in risk aversion, prosocial behavior, and impatience. We use GIS data and survey responses to identify disaster impact, showing that both community-level and individual-level experiences appear to affect preferences in theoretically plausible ways. Our findings have important implications for public policy efforts to address natural disasters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	2.4
This paper aims to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool for rainwater harvesting (RWH) on a university campus in Bogota, Colombia. The specific type of MCDA our research proposes is known as CRIDE (multi-CRIteria DEcision support tool), which allows us to study various methods of RWH. In order to account for uncertainties such as the variability of expert opinions and imprecision stemming from the different criteria required, we have designed this tool to incorporate ELECTRE II and the Monte Carlo method. For this case study we apply a methodology that evaluates the performance of six RWH scenarios. These six input scenarios emerged from an ideal one, wherein all rainwater throughout the campus is successfully harvested and treated until potable. From there, reality sets in: the other five scenarios are varying degrees of deviance from the ideal one, both in terms of water quantity and quality. In regard to collection and treatment we used sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). As for the evaluation of each of the scenarios, we outline eight criteria, which include hydraulic performance, compatibility with the University's Master Plan and financial aspects. Our research concludes that CRIDE as a means of support during the decision-making process generates a complete view of possible solutions, in addition to ranking these solutions. The CRIDE-based approach allows for the proposal of a methodology that evaluates the relevance of an established criteria set, using robustness, redundancy and sensitivity.	4.3
This paper presents a capacitive sensing system, addressing the issue of collision avoidance in partially modelled or unknown robot-assisted industrial environment by means of object distance measurement, motion tracking, and surface profile detection. The sensor consists of a mesh of multiple electrodes, a digital control module, a capacitance to digital converter, and a data processing module. The mesh is composed of 16 metal squares organized to form a 4x4 capacitor matrix. The electrode connections within the matrix can be reconfigured at run time by the digital control logic to provide multiple sense functionalities. Statistical regression models are applied to derive the distance and track the motion. A machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine, SVM) is applied to measured data to classify surface profiles. The fabricated sensing system has the ability of detecting objects at distances up to 20 cm from the sensor, and shows accuracy over 90% in profile recognition.	1.4
Volumes of rainwater harvested on-site are estimated by short-term storage capacity by two methods: graphical method and analytical method. The first method considers the difference between demand and supply over a specified period of time. The second uses random events to determine analytically, the storage capacity required to guarantee the draft. The comparison between the two methods indicates that there are minor differences. Based on the volume of water harvested after applying these methods, run-off coefficient for impervious surface in arid and semi-arid area was estimated. New analytical approach for long-term storage capacity is utilized to estimate the detention pond capacity off-site for the local natural streams. To apply this method, it is necessary to estimate the overall mean storage capacity in which the soil conservation service method is utilized. This technique is confirmed with graphical method.	4.3
In this paper, we focus on Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography (GSHHG) database registration for remote sensing images taken from geostationary meteorological satellites. While the accuracy of feature matching is the key component. To improve it, we propose a neighborhood geometry-based feature matching scheme which includes three steps: neighborhood coding, verification and fitting. (1) Neighborhood coding represents landmarks of GSHHG as a descriptive bit-matrix, and quantifies remote sensing images to a probability-based edge map and a binary geometry-based edge map. As a result, both gradient arid geometry similarity of local features in the remote sensing image and GSHHG can be measured. (2) Neighborhood verification is to encode spatial relationship among local features in neighbor, and discover outliers. (3) Neighborhood fitting fits the shorelines of GSHHG with the landmarks registered by neighborhood verification to improve recall. Experimental results on 25 pairs of newly annotated images show that the proposed method is competitive to several prior arts with respect to matching accuracy. What is more, our method is significantly more efficient than others.	4.2
Tropical home gardens in developing countries are a traditional land-use system, which contributes to the basic food requirements of the farming families, as well as providing a small but important income throughout the year. Most of these home gardens rely on rain for survival, i.e., rainfed systems. At present home gardens are being neglected due to social and environmental problems. Among these issues, the scarcity of water during cropping seasons is the most important issue that adversely affects crop production from home gardens. This is mainly due to the occurrence of unexpected dry periods during the cropping seasons, and the requirement to have a water source at the farmer's residence to irrigate the home garden during the dry spells (to capture and conserve roof runoff in the home gardens for subsequent use) is an appropriate green option to mitigate this situation. Microlevel rainwater tanks are promoted to be used to collect roof runoff water during wet periods enabling the farmer to irrigate his home garden crops during dry periods. Field experiments were carried out at Mapalana Research Farm in Sri Lanka to obtain the roof runoff coefficients from commonly used roof types; namely: asbestos, tiles, and thatched (either straw or woven coconut leaves). The objective of the case study is to develop a methodology to estimate the optimum size of a rainwater tank based on the roof size, roof cover, climatic conditions, and the irrigation requirement for home garden irrigation. This paper presents the experimental setup, the runoff coefficients obtained from different types of roof materials, and the methodology used to calculate the optimum storage capacity of the tank for home garden irrigation. In designing the rainwater tank sizes, microirrigation systems with both drip and pot irrigation systems were assessed. The water-use efficiency of drip systems was comparatively small compared to the subsurface pot irrigation. Based on the tank sizes obtained in the study, roof runoff water from the farmer's own roof is sufficient and recommended to be used as the irrigation source for home gardens.

Obesity is a major problem and maintaining a healthy diet and body weight has become increasingly important. Insulin is a known biomarker for the human metabolism, and measuring insulin may thus help inform decisions about diet choices. This provides a strong motivation to develop a fast, cheap, sensitive and easy to use home biosensor for insulin. Here we discuss the challenges and trade-offs between sensitivity, specificity, dynamic range, analysis times, instrumentation and sample transport and storage requirements for different biosensor development approaches. We show that the sensitivity of conventional SPR with a lower limit of detection of 0.5 nM is too low for practical purposes. Label-free antibody and aptamer carbon nanotube based systems suffer from lack of specificity. Highest sensitivity is afforded by mesoscale and phase monitoring electrochemical impedance spectroscopy assays with detection limits in the fM range, currently available only in a laboratory setting. Thus, a home-based insulin dip-stick is yet to be developed. [GRAPHICS] Biosensing traces and structure of insulin: an important molecule to be quantified with role in obesity and diabetes.	6.2
The present study estimates the temporal variability of the anthropogenic heat flux density (Q(F)) for three common land use types found in Singapore between October 2008 and March 2009. Q(F) is estimated by separately considering the major sources of waste heat in urban environments, which are heat release from vehicular traffic, buildings and human metabolism, respectively. The individual components of Q(F) are calculated by using a combination of top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches of energy consumption applied to the local context. Results show that over a 24-h period, magnitudes of mean hourly Q(F) reach maximum values of 113 W m(-2) in the commercial, 17 W m(-2) in the high-density public housing and 13 W m(-2) in the low-density residential areas, respectively. Buildings are found to be the major source of anthropogenic heat (primarily related to space cooling) in each study area, contributing to between 49-82% of Q(F) on weekdays and 46-81% on weekends. The spatial and temporal variations of Q(F) are attributed to differences in traffic volume, building energy consumption and population density. This is one of the first anthropogenic heat studies carried out in a tropical city and the results show that Q(F) can be substantial and of the same order of magnitude as calculated for city centres in mid-latitude cities during winter time.

Carbon fiber (CF) composites of organometallic intercalated polyaniline (Pani) and polypyrrole (Ppy) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) were electrochemically synthesized and tested as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. From the results obtained by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, it was concluded that the incorporation of copper(II) ions in the polymeric composite was successfully attained by adsorption of Cu2+ ions and 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (DMcT) monomers on the carbon microfibers. The experimental electrochemical impedance response of the obtained Pani(DMcT-Cu ion)/CF composite was simulated by adequate equivalent electrical circuits. After 20 charge/discharge cycles, the experimental discharge specific capacity of the Pani(DMcT-Cu ion)/CF composite was 118 mA h g(-1) (100% coulombic efficiency) using a 1 mol L-1 LiClO4 solution in propylene carbonate, and 110 mA h g(-1) when a polymeric electrolyte was used. In the charge/discharge tests of the Ppy-PSS/Pani/CF composite as anode, a high discharge specific capacity of 225 mA h g(-1) was obtained after 20 cycles. The resulting Ppy-PSS/Pani/CF/polymeric electrolyte/Pani(DMcT-Cu ion)/CF battery presented a specific capacity of 62 mA h g(-1) and could be charged up to 2.0 V, yielding an energy density 425 W h g(-1), with a coulombic efficiency of about 98%.

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are increasingly being used as an alternative source of water supply. However, their installation is not often financially feasible. The feasibility analysis of such investments is carried out by traditional techniques that have uncertainty limitations. Thus, the objective of this study is to describe how the studies concerning the economic feasibility of RWH systems have been conducted, thus identifying trends of current studies through a systematic review. We performed a literature search of published articles and, using defined inclusion criteria, 30 relevant articles were selected. We noted an increase in publications on this issue in recent years, and we demonstrate that the feasibility of the systems is frequently calculated by discounted cash flow methods. Several studies seek to incorporate uncertainties with an analysis of sensitivity, and only one study uses real options analysis. With these analyses, we provide recommendations for future studies and an overview of the current literature.	4.3
Inflammatory joint disease (IJD) is a group of conditions that target the joints and periarticular structures. The contribution of genetic factors to these conditions is often less than 50%, suggesting a major role for environmental influences. Twin studies are the best means of assessing the role for genetic factors in IJD. Conclusive evidence has been provided by a few studies in vast samples of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, with only one twin in each pair having IJD. These studies have been most successful in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. The other IJDs have proven more difficult to evaluate. This review demonstrates that genetic and environmental factors are inextricably linked and that ascribing IJDs to one or the other is misguided. Awareness of the limitations and possible sources of bias in twin studies is important when seeking to understand the development of these complex diseases.

This work numerically studies transient behaviour of particulate flows in a cylindrical-conical spouted bed in terms of comparative analysis of different models' predictions. Two approaches were used: a laminar flow model and a turbulent flow model. As a reference case, we consider experimental studies by He et al.,([ 14,15]) where the profiles of vertical particle velocities and the void fraction in the spout and the fountain of a full-column spout bed were measured. In this work we used the Euler-Euler unsteady multiphase model with the Syamlal-O'Brien, Gidaspow, and Wen-Yu drag models available in commercial CFD software Fluent 14.0. Analysis of results obtained by the use of laminar and turbulent flow models revealed almost identical solid and gas phase velocities and phase fractions within the spouted bed region. We found that the turbulence plays a significant role only in the gas phase above the spouted bed and it does not have any influence on the solid phase. Comparing our simulation results in the form of time-averaged vertical velocity of the solid phase against experimental data showed acceptable agreement in the spout and very good agreement in the fountain region. Numerical simulations with the Syamlal-O'Brien drag model gave better agreement with experimental data than results obtained using the Gidaspow and Wen-Yu drag models. To analyze the transient behaviour of the spouted bed, we use the volume-averaged particle velocity and gas phase velocity. The analysis of their time histories showed that the start up time is 2-3 s. The developed unsteady regime is reached after 4-5 s. Additionally we studied numerically the influence of different discretization schemes for convective terms on the final results. We found that the use of 1st order upwind scheme gives a steady state solution for both models, laminar and turbulent. Finally, we investigated the influence of the restitution coefficient on the transient characteristics of a cylindrical-conical spouted bed. A decrease in the value of the restitution coefficient leads to an increase in the period of oscillations of the volume-averaged velocities of the gas and solid phases.	3.4
Gully erosion represents one of the most significant types of land degradation in the Mediterranean areas, giving place to important on- and off-site effects. In this paper, a second-order gully located in SW Spain is analyzed. Along the gully, 28 cross-sections were established and measured with a Leica TCRM1102 laser total station, approximately every 6 months from 2001 to 2007. The sections were located at variable distance, placing them in areas where active erosion was evident. In total, 13 field measurements were carried out, and the geometric characteristics of 28 cross-sections were obtained. Morphometric analyses were carried out in both the main gully and a tributary reach by applying an empirical relationship between channel length and eroded volume. Morphometric variables of the gully sections were combined into two dimensionless groups, and a morphological similarity between different linear erosion land forms (rills, ephemeral and permanent gullies) was obtained. Then, the coefficient of variation of the calculated volumes was used to compare the instability between the main gully and the tributary reach. Finally, the hydraulic geometry of the gully was assessed by calibrating three empirical power equations, which relate bankfull discharge with mean flow velocity, cross-sectional depth and width. The hydraulic characterization of the main gully and the tributary reach was investigated for each field survey and a different behavior was detected. The hydraulic analysis also demonstrated that higher values of discharge provide better predictions of flow velocity; the size of the main and tributary gullies affects the discharge-width relationship; and that gully depth is the variable which can be predicted with the highest accuracy.

This paper presents a new model that describes the physical phenomena occurring in an individual Outer Hair Cell (OHC) in the human hearing organ (Cochlea). The new model employs the concept of parametric amplification and piezoelectricity. As a consequence, the proposed model may explain in a natural way many as yet unresolved problems about the mechanisms of: 1) power amplification, 2) nonlinearity, 3) fine tuning, or 4) high sensitivity that take place in the human hearing organ. Mathematical analysis of the model is performed. The equivalent electrical circuits of an individual OHC are established. The high selectivity of the OHC parametric amplifier is analyzed by solving the resulting Mathieu and Ince differential equations. An analytical formula for the power gain in the OHC's parametric amplifier has been developed. The proposed model has direct physical interpretation and all its elements have their physical counterparts in the actual structure of the cochlea. The numerical values of the individual elements of the electrical equivalent circuits are consistent with the experimental physiological data. It is anticipated that the proposed new model may contribute in future improvements of human cochlear implants as well as in development of new digital audio standards.	1.2
Edge extraction from high spatial resolution (HSR) remotely sensed images is one of the essential tasks for image segmentation and object identification. We present an optimal Gabor-based edge detection method which mainly focuses on selecting optimal parameters, including central frequency and spectrum scale, for Gabor filter. The central frequency is automatically optimized by phase randomization and the human visual system-based structure similarity index. Next, the optimal spectrum scale is determined based on two-dimensional power spectrum density. The edge detection method is comprehensively discussed in the analysis of parameter sensitivity, overall performance, and comparative tests with several widely used methods. Qualitative and quantitative experimental studies, performed on six test images with various spatial resolution, show that the proposed method provides a promising solution to edge detection from HSR remotely sensed images.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an autoimmune disease with a chronic inflammatory arthritis. The critical role of methylation in the biology of immunocytes has increasingly been surveyed to discover disease etiology. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is an enzyme, which establishes and regulates patterns of methylated cytosine residues. The aim of the current investigation was to unveil if methylation circumstances of CpG sites in DNMT1 promoter could affect the mRNA expression level of this gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AS patients. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 40 AS patients and 40 healthy individuals. Total RNA and DNA contents of leukocytes were extracted. Afterward, quantitative analysis was carried out by real-time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. Finally, to determine the methylation level, PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA from patients and controls were sequenced. Compared with healthy controls, expression level of DNMT1 in AS patients was significantly downregulated. Methylation of DNMT1 promoter was significantly higher in AS patients in comparison to controls. While a negative correlation between methylation and expression level of DNMT1 was observed in AS patients, both methylation and expression level of DNMT1 did not correlate with clinical manifestations. Considering the observation that decreased expression level of DNMT1 was associated with hypermethylation of DNMT1 promoter in PBMCs from AS patients, this survey suggests that dysregulation of DNMT1 expression through altered methylation level of other target genes would probably contribute to AS development.	5.3
Automatic image annotation has been an active topic of research in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition for decades. In this paper, we present a new method for automatic image annotation based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) considering cross-modal correlations. To be specific, we first employ GMM fitted by the rival penalized expectation-maximization (RPEM) algorithm to estimate the posterior probabilities of each annotation keyword. Next, a label similarity graph is constructed by a weighted linear combination of label similarity and visual similarity by seamlessly integrating the information from both image low level visual features and high level semantic concepts together, which can effectively avoid the phenomenon that different images with the same candidate annotations would obtain the same refinement results. Followed by the rank-two relaxation heuristics over the built label similarity graph is applied to further mine the correlation of the candidate annotations so as to capture the refining annotation results, which plays a crucial role in the semantic based image retrieval. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) Exploiting GMM that is trained by the RPEM algorithm to capture the initial semantic annotations of images. (2) The label similarity graph is constructed by a weighted linear combination of label similarity and visual similarity of images associated with the corresponding labels. (3) Refining the candidate set of annotations generated by the GMM through solving the max-bisection based on the rank-two relaxation algorithm over the weighted label graph. Compared to the current competitive model SGMM-RW, we can achieve significant improvements of 4% and 5% in precision, 6% and 9% in recall on the Corel5k and Mirflickr25k, respectively.

Extreme flood events often lead to considerable loss of human life, and previous studies on the stability criteria for people in floods do not account for the effect of various slopes. The proposal of an appropriate stability criterion for a range of slopes is therefore important. In this study a mechanics-based incipient velocity formula was extended for a human body in floodwater at toppling instability, with the ground slope being included. Using a laboratory flume, about 250 experimental tests were conducted to obtain water depth and velocity conditions at toppling instability for a small-scale model human body for four slopes. The experimental data obtained for flat ground and slopes of 2 and 4% were used to determine values for two parameters in the derived formula. These parameters were unified to corresponding mean values for various slopes. The calculations using the proposed formula and the unified parameters compare well with the scaled-up experimental data for a slope of 2.5%. Finally, the proposed formula was used to estimate critical velocities under different depths for a typical adult. The differences in stability criteria between the results obtained from the model and prototype experiments are also presented.	3.1
Cavitation is one of the important elements influencing the performance of sea water hydraulic axial piston pump. To understand the working performance of sea water hydraulic axial piston pump under cavitation effects, a fully dynamic numerical model was developed in this article, which has taken into account the fluid compressibility effect, dynamic processes of gaseous, vaporous, pseudo-cavitation and cavitation damage, and the simulation was conducted through a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code PumpLinx. The cavitation characteristics of the pump were presented with a set of working conditions, as well as the cavitation damage power, dynamic gas volume fraction and vapor volume fraction inside the intake, piston and port plate chamber. A test rig was developed to validate the computational fluid dynamics simulations for the case of sea water hydraulic axial piston pump. Comparisons between the measured and simulated instantaneous discharge pressure, average flow as well as the vibration characteristics under different extents of cavitation by varying the inlet pressure and rotational speed of the pump were presented.	3.1
Localization, tracking, and recognition of objects and humans are basic tasks that are of high value in the applications of ambient intelligence. Sensing floors were introduced to address these tasks in a non-intrusive way. To recognize the humans moving on the floor, they are usually first localized, and then a set of gait features are extracted (stride length, cadence, and pressure profile over a footstep). However, recognition generally fails when several people stand or walk together, preventing successful tracking. This paper presents a detection, tracking, and recognition technique which uses objects' weight. It continues working even when tracking individual persons becomes impossible. Inspired by computer vision, this technique processes the floor pressure-image by segmenting the blobs containing objects, tracking them, and recognizing their contents through a mix of inference and combinatorial search. The result lists the probabilities of assignments of known objects to observed blobs. The concept was successfully evaluated in daily life activity scenarii, involving multi-object tracking and recognition on low-resolution sensors, crossing of user trajectories, and weight ambiguity. This technique can be used to provide a probabilistic input for multi-modal object tracking and recognition systems.	4.0
In this paper, we present a novel method based on a single-phase active power filter (APF) for series arc faults detection in an AC electrical installation. The APF's reference current is used as the starting point for our method tested on a large variety of loads: resistors, vacuum cleaner, rotary drill, dimmer and AC-DC power supplies. Firstly, the proposed method is validated at the simulation level using the Matlab software and then experimentally using the Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) approach with an FPGA Altera Stratix III prototyping board. The results obtained in this work show that series arc faults can be successfully detected with an APF, only by updating its digital control with the arc fault detection functionality, instead of designing from the very beginning an arc-fault detection specific device.

Knowledge growth models, based on primary principles, play a fundamental role in the cognitive sciences. The authors submit an extension of their model (ENKI) from 2005, with the results of the practical testing, which was performed using the method developed for the purpose of model ENKI of solving tasks with immediate feedback. This was applied to the curriculum of parallel configuration of resistors in electrical circuits. There were 73 pupils from six elementary schools in attendance for testing. Analysis based on ENKI indicates that three autonomous units (scopes) were evaluated simultaneously during the assessment. Results showed that 25% of pupils knew the curriculum, 9% of pupils showed no improvement, while 66% of pupils showed an increased success in accordance with the ENKI model (significance level alpha= 0.05). Solving 7.2 typical tasks on average, by a method of immediate feedback resulted in 90% of the pupils mastering the curriculum.	1.2
In this study, laccase from Trametes versicolor was immobilized in poly(acrylamide-crotonic acid)/sodium alginate [P(AAm-CrA)/alginate], poly(acrylamide-crotonic acid)/K-carrageenan [(P(AAm-CrA)/K-car)], poly(acrylamide-citraconic acid)/sodium alginate (P(AAm-CA)/alginate), and poly(acrylamide-citraconic acid)/K-carrageenan (P(AAm-CA)/K-car) semi-interpenetrating network by entrapment method. Optimum pH and temperatures values were determined between 5.0-6.0 and 40-50 degrees C for free laccase (FL) and immobilized laccases, respectively. After 42 days of storage at 4 degrees C, FL and immobilized laccases retained their original activities in the range of 55%-73%. Percent decolorization of Acid Orange 52 by free enyzme and enyzmes immobilized in hydrogels was found between 63% and 39%. Percent decolorization of Acid Orange 52 in the presence of mediator by free enyzme was found 73% and enyzmes immobilized in hydrogels were found as 73%.

Recent methods for detailed and accurate biomass and carbon stock estimation of forests have been driven by advances in remote sensing technology. The conventional approach to biomass estimation heavily relies on the tree species and site-specific allometric equations, which are based on destructive methods. This paper introduces a non-destructive, laser-based approach (terrestrial laser scanner) for individual tree aboveground biomass estimation in the Royal Belum forest reserve, Perak, Malaysia. The study area is in the state park, and it is believed to be one of the oldest rainforests in the world. The point clouds generated for 35 forest plots, using the terrestrial laser scanner, were geo-rectified and cleaned to produce separate point clouds for individual trees. The volumes of tree trunks were estimated based on a cylinder model fitted to the point clouds. The biomasses of tree trunks were calculated by multiplying the volume and the species wood density. The biomasses of branches and leaves were also estimated based on the estimated volume and density values. Branch and leaf volumes were estimated based on the fitted point clouds using an alpha-shape approach. The estimated individual biomass and the total above ground biomass were compared with the aboveground biomass (AGB) value estimated using existing allometric equations and individual tree census data collected in the field. The results show that the combination of a simple single-tree stem reconstruction and wood density can be used to estimate stem biomass comparable to the results usually obtained through existing allometric equations. However, there are several issues associated with the data and method used for branch and leaf biomass estimations, which need further improvement.	4.2
Quality of Context (QoC) awareness is recognized as a key point for the success of context-aware computing. At the time where the combination of the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, and Ambient Intelligence paradigms offer together new opportunities for managing richer context data, the next generation of Distributed Context Managers (DCM) is facing new challenges concerning QoC management. This paper presents our model-driven QoCIM framework. QoCIM is the acronym for Quality of Context Information Model. We show how it can help application developers to manage the whole QoC life-cycle by providing genericity, openness and uniformity. Its usages are illustrated, both at design time and at runtime, in the case of an urban pollution context- and QoC-aware scenario.	4.0
In this article, a numerical method for detailed studies of two-phase mass transfer is introduced that is based on a three-dimensional finite volume Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method. The implementation of the two-phase species equation employs the Dirichlet-Neumann algorithm, following the domain coupling technique of the underlying hydrodynamical solver by Tukovic and Jasak (2012). The coupling is found to be dependent on the discontinuities of the concentration and its first derivative, as well as on which side of the interface Dirichlet or Neumann conditions are specified. Relaxation parameters are introduced to stabilize the algorithm and optimal coefficients are calculated explicitly. The numerical method is thoroughly validated by a three dimensional advection-diffusion test case, proving the accuracy of the local Sherwood numbers for Peclet numbers up to 100000, which is ten times higher than the currently reported maximum. Additionally, a limit model for instantaneous reactions is implemented and validated, allowing the computation of product concentrations and of local and global enhancement factors.

Ambient intelligence (AmI) deals with a new world of ubiquitous computing devices, where physical environments interact intelligently and unobtrusively with people. AmI environments can be diverse, such as homes, offices, meeting rooms, schools, hospitals, control centers, vehicles, tourist attractions, stores, sports facilities, and music devices. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a testbed for AmI using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian OS. We analyze the performance of k-means clustering algorithm. For evaluation we considered respiratory rate and heart rate metrics. The simulation results show that the k-means clustering algorithm has a good performance.	4.0
Rural electrification rates in India lag behind government goals, in part due to the inability of distribution companies (discoms) to fund central grid expansion. In the absence of central grid electrification, mini-grids offer significant potential for an immediate pathway toward rural electrification and the attendant gains in economic growth and productivity. Yet private investment in mini-grids has been virtually absent in India. Using a comprehensive life-cycle cost analysis, we find that mini-grids based on solar PV power and storage are more economical than incumbent energy services available to households without central grid connection. Under current law, a prospective entrepreneur in India does not require a license or certification in order to build a mini-grid and subsequently provide electricity services in the area covered by said installation. Conversely, there is no legal or regulatory framework that specifies what is to happen if the central grid were to be extended to an area that is already covered by a mini-grid. We report detailed survey evidence from interviews with entrepreneurs, analysts and policymakers whose assessments converge on the same point: mini-grid investments would be jeopardized in the event of central grid extension, precisely because discoms would, by regulatory order, provide electricity services at highly subsidized rates, well below their full economic cost. Our fieldwork suggests that the threat of central grid extension is a gateway barrier preventing mini-grid development in India. The issues associated with the gateway barrier have common elements with the so-called holdup problem as identified in the economics of organizations. There have been two recent federal policy guidelines and one actual state-level policy addressing the regulatory status of mini-grids. We examine the effectiveness of these policies/proposals in terms of an entrepreneur's willingness to develop mini-grids in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
This study investigated the effect of carbon fibers as brush anode materials on the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Two types of carbon fibers with different electrical resistivity and functionality polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (rho: 28.0 mu Omega m) and pitch (rho: 2.05 mu Omega m) were investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the PAN- and pitch-based carbon fibers presented almost the same surface elements and functional groups, and there was no significant difference in microbial growth on the brush anodes. Current interrupt and steady discharging methods demonstrated the pitch-based carbon brush anodes had lower ohmic resistance and generated higher power density. After nitric acid treatment, the power density generated by the PAN- and pitch-based anodes increased by 29.3% and 26.7%, achieving 816 and 895 mW m(-2), respectively. Using pitch-based carbon fiber brush as anode attained better performance than the widely used PAN-based carbon brush. The acid treated pitch-based carbon fibers provide a promising alternative to highly efficient anode materials for the extensive application of MFCs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1.0
Rainwater harvesting from hard roofing can provide safe water to meet the basic domestic needs of several hundred million people in low-income countries. However, rainwater harvesting has a higher household cost than other lowtechnology water supplies such as protected springs. The storage tank is the most expensive part of the infrastructure required for rainwater harvesting: reducing this cost will enable rainwater harvesting to become a viable water source for many more households in low-income countries. This paper assesses the overall costs and different cost components of rainwater storage tanks. Costs are compared across a selection of tanks prefabricated in factories in Uganda, Kenya and the UK and constructed in situ in Uganda. Constructed tanks were always found to be cheaper than prefabricated ones. Tank size was an important factor, and it was found that tank cost per litre decreases as size increases. For all tank types, materials were the greatest cost.	4.3
A tsunami is a series of great waves primarily caused by a major subduction-zone earthquake with large-scale displacement of the sea floor or by initiation of submarine landslides. Many coastal areas in the western United States are subject to tsunami hazard that is infrequent but potentially extremely destructive. The public safety risk has been only partially mitigated through warning and preparedness of evacuation; there are many coastal communities in the states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii where there is insufficient time for complete evacuation, and places of higher elevation and/or taller structures could provide life safety. Community disaster resilience would also require that critical and essential facilities provide structural resistance to collapse. Towards that goal, the Tsunami Loads and Effects Subcommittee of the ASCE/Structural Engineering Institute (ASCE/SEI) 7 Standards Committee has developed a new Chapter 6 with design requirements for tsunami loads and effects, contained in the 2016 edition of the ASCE 7 standard Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures [Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures]. The ASCE 7-16 Tsunami Loads and Effects chapter will become the first national, consensus-based standard for tsunami resilience for use in the states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. The purpose of this paper is to provide an explanation of the technical basis and methodology for tsunami-resilient design of critical and essential facilities, tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structures, and other multistory building structures. The ASCE 7 provisions for tsunami loads and effects implements a unified set of analysis and design methodologies with design maps based on probabilistic hazard analysis, loads based on tsunami physics, and a structural ultimate strength basis of design. Probabilistic offshore tsunami amplitude maps and tsunami design zone inundation maps were developed using a method consistent with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the treatment of seismic source uncertainties. Procedures for tsunami inundation analysis are based on using mapped values of offshore tsunami amplitude or the runup and inundation limit shown in tsunami design zone maps. The ASCE 7 Tsunami Loads and Effects chapter is consistent with the principles of probabilistic hazard analysis, tsunami physics, and fluid mechanics, integrated into a comprehensive set of design provisions.	3.4
The use of simulation tools and three dimensional (3D) computer aided design is currently widespread in Process Engineering for machine design, manufacturing tools and dimensional control models, but it is not so common for method and job design. For workplace design it is essential to have all data from product, process, and resources needed to manufacture. Human factor is a key issue among these resources, as it obliges to make a working environment major study, in order to ensure that operators can perform their tasks in safety way and without injury damages. In this way, the use of a Digital Human Model as a first element of the denominated 'Digital Manufacturing', is an excellent opportunity to integrate all the product-process design elements into a real concurrent engineering, which allows to analyze important variables such as ergonomics or time estimation. From ergonomics point of view, all the possible and potential injuries in the musculoskeletal system which could be a result or consequence of job tasks development have generated a great interest at Manufacturing Engineering. This paper presents an addition, extension and annexe of the ergonomic analysis methods for these risks prevention, which currently has one of the most used tools in sectors such as aeronautics and automotive. It has been for the first time satisfactorily implemented the OCRA Check-List method in a 3D design and simulation environment application, evaluating the simulation tool ability and capacity for tasks time prediction. The application, together with the evaluator active participation, permits to make correct risks analysis of musculoskeletal injuries due to repetitive work, as well as tasks time development estimation.	3.2
AES algorithm or Rijndael algorithm is a network security algorithm which is most commonly used in all types of wired and wireless digital communication networks for secure transmission of data between two end users, especially over a public network. This paper presents the hardware implementation of AES Rijndael Encryption and Decryption Algorithm by using Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. The hardware design approach is entirely based on pre-calculated look-up tables (LUTs) which results in less complex architecture, thereby providing high throughput and low latency. There are basically three different formats in AES. They are AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. The encryption and decryption blocks of all the three formats are efficiently designed by using Verilog-HDL and are synthesized on Virtex-7 XC7VX690T chip (Target Device) with the help of Xilinx ISE Design Suite-14.7 Tool. The synthesis tool was set to optimize speed, area and power. The power analysis is made by using Xilinx XPower Analyzer. Pre-calculated LUTs are used for the implementation of algorithmic functions, namely S-Box and Inverse S-Box transformations and also for GF (28) i. e. Galois Field Multiplications involved in Mix-Columns and Inverse Mix-Columns transformations. The proposed architecture is found to be having good efficiency in terms of latency, throughput, speed/delay, area and power.	0.2
In the past few years many choreographers have focused upon implementation of computer technology to enhance their artistic skills. Computer vision technology presents new methods for learning, instructing, developing, and assessing physical movements as well as provides scope to expand dance resources and rediscover the learning process. This work reviews the study done over AR based learning technologies for the development of inter personal skills. This paper further elaborates the literature done till date within the scope of AR based training for educational aspects. The review focuses on the techniques categorized according to the type of dance learning method which can further be enhanced and addressed by means of novel AR based technology. The authors aim to provide an overview for learning standards based on AR Kinect sensors. In addition the future work is toward exploring the latest version of Kinect V2 for dance training that could become the next futuristic virtual educator.	0.0
We review the bio-activities of natural product sesquiterpenes and present the first description of their effects upon mitosis. This type of biological effect upon cells is unexpected because sesquiterpenes are believed to inactivate proteins through Michael-type additions that cause non-specific cytotoxicity. Yet, certain types of sesquiterpenes can arrest cells in mitosis as measured by cell biology, biochemical and imaging techniques. We have listed the sesquiterpenes that arrest cells in mitosis and analyzed the biological data that support those observations. In view of the biochemical complexity of mitosis, we propose that a subset of sesquiterpenes have a unique chemical structure that can target a precise protein(s) required for mitosis. Since the process of mitotic arrest precedes that of cell death, it is possible that some sesquiterpenes that are currently classified as cytotoxic might also induce a mitotic arrest. Our analysis provides a new perspective of sesquiterpene chemical biology.	6.1
When imitating novel actions, typically developing preschoolers often copy components of the demonstration that are unrelated to the modeled action's goal, a phenomenon known as 'overimitation'. According to the social motivation account, overimitation fulfills social affiliation motives (i.e., the imitator's drive to experience social connectedness with the demonstrator and the social context). Conversely, according to the social-cognitive account, overimitation reflects overattribution of causal relevance (i.e., the imitator's failure to appreciate that some components of the demonstration are not relevant to the action's outcome). Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and William syndrome (WS) are characterized by reduced and enhanced spontaneous social motivation, respectively, as well as similar impairments in social-cognition, thus providing helpful test cases to understand the nature of overimitation. Using a novel eye-tracking paradigm, we examined overimitation in 31 preschoolers with ASD, 18 age-and IQ-matched peers with WS, and 19 age-matched typically developing children. We found that children with WS and typically developing children were more likely to overimitate, and to increase their attention to the model's face during demonstration of causally irrelevant actions, compared to those with ASD. These findings will be discussed in the context of support for the social-motivational account of overimitation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	2.1
With the popularization and application of Internet technology, it has brought great opportunities, challenges and has a significant change to various industries, which entered the Internet age. Computer network is double-edged sword, bringing convenience to people at the same time there are some security risks, seriously affecting the information security of the Internet Age. Therefore, this article is to explore the main computer network security risks and to lower the risks of computer security management measures, thus providing an important guarantee for computer network security.	0.2
The use of violent video games has been often linked to increase of aggressive behavior. According to the General Aggression Model, one of the central mechanisms for this aggressiveness inducing impact is an emotional desensitization process resulting from long lasting repeated violent game playing. This desensitization should evidence itself in a lack of empathy. Recent research has focused primarily on acute, short term impact of violent media use but only little is known about long term effects. In this study 15 excessive users of violent games and control subjects matched for age and education viewed pictures depicting emotional and neutral situations with and without social interaction while fMRI activations were obtained. While the typical pattern of activations for empathy and theory of mind networks was seen, both groups showed no differences in brain responses. We interpret our results as evidence against the desensitization hypothesis and suggest that the impact of violent media on emotional processing may be rather acute and short-lived.	2.1
Plant transpiration is the main evaporative flux from terrestrial ecosystems; it controls land surface energy balance, determines catchment hydrological responses and influences regional and global climate. Transpiration regulation by plants is a key (and still not completely understood) process that underlies vegetation drought responses and land evaporative fluxes under global change scenarios. Thermometric methods of sap flow measurement have now been widely used to quantify whole-plant and stand transpiration in forests, shrublands and orchards around the world. A large body of research has applied sap flow methods to analyse seasonal and diurnal patterns of transpiration and to quantify their responses to hydroclimatic variability, but syntheses of sap flow data at regional to global scales are extremely rare. Here we present the SAPFLUXNET initiative, aimed at building the first global database of plant-level sap flow measurements. A preliminary metadata survey launched in December 2015 showed an encouraging response by the sap flow community, with sap flow data sets from field studies representing >160 species and >120 globally distributed sites. The main goal of SAPFLUXNET is to analyse the ecological factors driving plant-and stand-level transpiration. SAPFLUXNET will open promising research avenues at an unprecedented global scope, namely: (i) exploring the spatio-temporal variability of plant transpiration and its relationship with plant and stand attributes, (ii) summarizing physiological regulation of transpiration by means of few water-use traits, usable for land surface models, (iii) improving our understanding of the coordination between gas exchange and plant-level traits (e.g., hydraulics) and (iv) analysing the ecological factors controlling stand transpiration and evapotranspiration partitioning. Finally, SAPFLUXNET can provide a benchmark to test models of physiological controls of transpiration, contributing to improve the accuracy of individual water stress responses, a key element to obtain robust predictions of vegetation responses to climate change.	3.1
A portable real-time facial recognition system that is able to play personalized music based on the identified person's preferences was developed. The system is called Portable Facial Recognition Jukebox Using Fisherfaces (FRJ). Raspberry Pi was used as the hardware platform for its relatively low cost and ease of use. This system uses the OpenCV open source library to implement the computer vision Fisherfaces facial recognition algorithms, and uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library for playing the sound files. FRJ is crossplatform and can run on both Windows and Linux operating systems. The source code was written in C++. The accuracy of the recognition program can reach up to 90% under controlled lighting and distance conditions. The user is able to train up to 6 different people (as many as will fit in the GUI). When implemented on a Raspberry Pi, the system is able to go from image capture to facial recognition in an average time of 200ms.	0.4
There is evidence that some emotional expressions are characterized by diagnostic cues from individual face features. For example, an upturned mouth is indicative of happiness, whereas a furrowed brow is associated with anger. The current investigation explored whether motivating people to perceive stimuli in a local (i.e., feature-based) rather than global (i.e., holistic) processing orientation was advantageous for recognizing emotional facial expressions. Participants classified emotional faces while primed with local and global processing orientations, via a Navon letter task. Contrary to previous findings for identity recognition, the current findings are indicative of a modest advantage for face emotion recognition under conditions of local processing orientation. When primed with a local processing orientation, participants performed both significantly faster and more accurately on an emotion recognition task than when they were primed with a global processing orientation. The impacts of this finding for theories of emotion recognition and face processing are considered.	2.2
Genes that in certain conditions make their carriers altruistic are being identified, and altruism and selfishness have shown to be heritable in man. This raises the possibility that genetic polymorphisms for altruism/selfishness exist in man and other animals. Here we characterize some of the conditions in which genetic polymorphisms may occur. We show for dominant or recessive alleles how the positions of stable equilibria depend on the benefit to the recipient, b, and the cost to the altruist, c, for diploid altruists helping half or full sibs, and haplodiploid altruists helping sisters. Stable polymorphisms always occur close to the Hamilton threshold rb = c. The position of the stable equilibrium moves away 0 or 1 with both increases in c, the cost paid by the altruist, and increasing divergence from the Hamilton threshold, and alleles for selfishness can reach frequencies around 50%. We evaluate quantitative estimates of b, c and r from field studies in the light of these predictions, but the values do not fall in the regions where genetic polymorphisms are expected. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see as genes for altruism are discovered whether they are accompanied by alternate alleles for selfishness.	2.4
Animals domesticated for working closely with humans (e.g. dogs) have been shown to be remarkable in adjusting their behaviour to human attentional stance. However, there is little evidence for this form of information perception in species domesticated for production rather than companionship. We tested domestic ungulates (goats) for their ability to differentiate attentional states of humans. In the first experiment, we investigated the effect of body and head orientation of one human experimenter on approach behaviour by goats. Test subjects (N = 24) significantly changed their behaviour when the experimenter turned its back to the subjects, but did not take into account head orientation alone. In the second experiment, goats (N = 24) could choose to approach one of two experimenters, while only one was paying attention to them. Goats preferred to approach humans that oriented their body and head towards the subject, whereas head orientation alone had no effect on choice behaviour. In the third experiment, goats (N = 32) were transferred to a separate test arena and were rewarded for approaching two experimenters providing a food reward during training trials. In subsequent probe test trials, goats had to choose between the two experimenters differing in their attentional states. Like in Experiments 1 and 2, goats did not show a preference for the attentive person when the inattentive person turned her head away from the subject. In this last experiment, goats preferred to approach the attentive person compared to a person who closed their eyes or covered the whole face with a blind. However, goats showed no preference when one person covered only the eyes. Our results show that animals bred for production rather than companionship show differences in their approach and choice behaviour depending on human attentive state. However, our results contrast with previous findings regarding the use of the head orientation to attribute attention and show the importance of cross-validating results.	2.1
In this study, a model is presented to obtain the parameters of penalty and reward scheme (PRS) in performance-based regulation (PBR) for each electricity distribution company (EDC) using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). In the FCM algorithm, similar companies were categorized into clusters. By using AHP, score of effective factor in reliability index was obtained. In this model, external factors affecting EDCs performance were considered to reduce the risk of PBR implementation for companies and customers. The proposed model was applied on the EDCs in Iran. The results, including AHP score, parameters of PRS and PRS cost were calculated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
The security of traditional identity-based signature (IBS) is totally built upon the assumption that the private key is absolutely secure. However, with the increasing use of mobile and unprotected devices in today's cryptosystems, the threat of key exposure represents a more serious and realistic concern. To mitigate the damage of key exposure in the setting of IBS, we propose to integrate key evolution and user revocation into IBS, and present forward-secure identity-based signature with user revocation (FS-RIBS). Specifically, we formalize the syntax and security definition of FS-RIBS, and give a concrete construction. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the standard model under a q-type complexity assumption. To demonstrate the merits of our scheme, we theoretically analyse its performance by comparing it with other related works. Moreover, we provide an implementation and the corresponding timing results of our scheme to show its practicability.	0.3
Spin-optoelectronics is an emerging technology in which novel and advanced functionalities are enabled by the synergetic integration of magnetic, optical and electronic properties onto semiconductor-based devices. This article reviews the possible implementation and convergence of spintronics and photonics concepts on group IV semiconductors: the core materials of mainstream microelectronics. In particular, we describe the rapid pace of progress in the achievement of lasing action in the notable case of Ge-based heterostructures and devote special attention to the pivotal role played by optical investigations in advancing the understanding of the rich spin physics of group IV materials. Finally, we scrutinize recent developments towards the monolithic integration on Si of a new class of spin-based light emitting devices having prospects for applications in fields such as cryptography and interconnects.	0.3
Objectives: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are the cornerstone of treatment in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). We aimed to describe the real life NSAID use in early axSpA according to the disease characteristics. Methods: The DESIR cohort is an observational study of patients presenting with inflammatory back pain suggestive of axSpA for less than 3 years. Patients who attended all 6 visits (every 6 months during the first 2 years and yearly at 3 years) were analysed. Data collected at every visit over 3 years was NSAID intake and the ASAS-NSAID score for the 6 months preceding the visit, where 100 reflects the full daily intake of an NSAID. Results: In all, 627 patients were assessed: 46.1% males, mean age: 33.7 (standard deviation: 8.7) years, mean symptom duration: 1.5 (0.9) year and mean BASDAI: 44.3 (25.3). Over the 6 months preceding inclusion, 92.8% had received NSAIDs; this proportion significantly decreased over time, to 73% patients after 3 years (P < 0.001). This decrease was not different with regard to the fulfillment (or not) of the ASAS criteria at baseline, nor with regard to the arm of the ASAS criteria fulfilled (i.e. imaging vs. clinical). The median ASAS-NSAID score was 36 [interquartile range: 13-72] at inclusion, and substantially decreased to reach 7 [0-44] after 3 years (P<0.001), although BASDAI at 3 years was 33.8 (21.7). Conclusion: NSAID prescription was very frequent in this early axSpA cohort, but the intake was low, and decreased significantly over time, even though symptoms remained present. Early axSpA patients may not be sufficiently treated with NSAIDs. (C) 2016 Societe francaise de rhumatologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	5.3
An improved solution for drug distribution is presented in this paper. It is divided into two parts: i) a multi-operator evolutionary algorithm in charge of calculating the initial delivery routes and ii) an ambient intelligence-based support system able to tracing the merchandise along the distribution route. The first one establishes the routes to be followed by the vehicles, based on a proposal of estimation of the travel times. The second one is formed by a system able to recognize and trace the drugs inside each vehicle. A laboratory experimentation has been conducted in order to demonstrate the adequacy of the route calculator. In addition, a field experimentation has been carried out by implementing the traceability system in a delivery van which of the drug distributor in the city of Bilbao. Note to Practitioners-Motivated by the specific needs found by a drug distributor in managing deliveries to pharmacies involved in its supply chain, this paper considers an optimization problem as the proper way to model the particularities found in this scenario. This paper proposes the use of a combinatorial optimization problem as the way to model problems. Due to the fact that distributor's clients are located in different cities, the proposal considers travel times both between cities and inside the city. In addition, rush hours are also taken into account, in order to provide a more realistic model. Finally, a radio frequency identification-based solution is proposed, in order to implement traceability in the delivered products, as well as to prevent human errors. Additionally, in case an unavoidable error occurs, the solution offers also an incident management mechanism.	4.0
Bacteria are ubiquitous and abundant in the atmosphere and some of them are potential pathogens known to cause diseases or allergies in humans. However, the quantities and compositions of total airborne bacterial community and their relationships with environmental factors remain poorly investigated. Here, a case study of the total airborne bacteria of PM2.5 collected at six cities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) megalopolis, China were profiled using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq (PE300) sequencing. qPCR results showed the high abundance of total airborne bacteria of PM2.5 in BTH, ranging from 4.82 x 10(4) +/- 1.58 x 10(3) to 2.64 x 10(5) +/- 9.63 x 10(4) cell m(-3) air, and averaged 1.19 x 10(5) cell m(-3) air. The six PM2.(5) samples were classified into three groups. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the four dominant phyla of PM2.5. 18 common potential pathogens with extremely low percentage (3.61%) were observed, which were dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Escherichia coli. Plants and soil are probably the main sources of bacteria in PM2.5, as suggested by the high percentages of Chloroplast, plant-associated bacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales and Sphingomonadales) and soil-inhabiting bacteria (e.g., Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales). Variation partitioning analysis (VPA) indicated that the atmospheric pollutants explained the most of the variation (31.90%) in community structure of PM2.5, followed by meteorological conditions (15.73%) and the chemical compositions of PM2.5 (11.32%). The case study furthers our understanding of the diversity and composition of airborne bacterial communities of PM2.5 in BTH, and also identified the main factors shaping the bacterial communities.	5.1
Controversies on the surgical protocols and efficacies of total hip arthroplasty (THA) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) still exist. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the perioperative managements and their outcomes related to performing THA on patients with AS. Data of 54 AS patients who underwent 81 THAs between 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical and imaging data were collected preoperatively, postoperatively, and during the follow-up period for surgical efficacy. Using posterolateral approach, cementless prostheses were selected in all cases. Mean follow-up period was 3.6 years (range, 2-8 years). Inclinations and anteversions of acetabular cups were 36.3 degrees +/- 4.5 degrees(range, 30 degrees-50 degrees) and 12.3 degrees +/- 4.9 degrees (range, 0 degrees-25 degrees) respectively. Mean visual analog scale (VAS) score decreased from 6.7 +/- 2.1 (range, 4-10) preoperatively to 1.5 +/- 1.0 (range, 0-4) at final follow-up, and mean Harris hip score (HHS) improved from 31.2 +/- 11.6 (range, 15-45) to 86.1 +/- 4.3 (range, 80-95) (P<0.05). Postoperative range of motion (ROM) in flexion was improved from 6.7 degrees +/- 13.5 degrees(range, 0 degrees-50 degrees) preoperatively to 82.5 degrees +/- 6.4 degrees (range, 70 degrees-100 degrees) at final follow-up, and ROM in extension was improved from 1.8 degrees +/- 5.7 degrees(range, 0 degrees-15 degrees) to 15.4 degrees +/- 2.6 degrees (range, 10 degrees-20 degrees) (P<0.05). Heterotopic ossification (HO) was documented in 9 hips (11.1%). Signs of stable fibrous ingrowth and bone ingrowth were detected in 52 and 29 hips, respectively. Sciatic never injury was occurred in 3 cases, and treated conservatively. There were no signs of periprosthetic fractures, dislocation, or prosthesis loosening. Surgical efficacies of THA for AS patients with severe hip involvement are satisfactory.	5.3
For the detection of chemical agents in different environments, the combination of plastic optical fibers (POFs) and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) receptors has been tested as a way to obtain low cost, highly selective and sensitive optical chemical sensors based on plasmonic resonance. In this work, a novel type of optical chemical sensor able to detect the binding reactions occurring between the MIP and analyte has been designed, fabricated and applied for the selective detection of dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS) in transformer oil. This analyte is important in the control of transformer oil, since it is responsible for the corrosive properties of the oil. The new optical sensor platform is based on two plastic optical fibers that work as segmented waveguides coupled through a polymer molecularly imprinted for the analyte. The prepolymeric MIP solution was deposited by drop coating in a trench milled between the two fibers. The experimental results indicated that this new sensor can be useful for the determination of DBDS in transformer oil and it paves the way to a new approach in the optical fiber sensors for MIPs.

M-Commerce applications in the world have grown exponentially over the years. It had set up for mobile users to engage wirelessly of ad hoc network infrastructure in online business irrespective of place or time. Providing anonymous, secure and trust based connection service in ad hoc network is quite a challenging task. Anonymity, security and privacy of the transaction or message transmission are the highest priority need to be delivered to the destination node on time. In this paper, a CAEC(2) M (Cellular Automata Elliptic Curve Cryptography Mix network) algorithm to secure Mobile Commerce over ad hoc network is proposed. An attempt is made to design a mix-network (Mix-Net) using elliptic curve cryptography based on cellular automata which creates a hard to trace communication to protect the anonymity of the sender and encrypt the sensitive information to avoid any eavesdropper trying to access the data during transmission. CAEC 2 M provides also confidentiality, integrity and authentication.	0.3
This study examined the associations between teacher attunement to aggressive students and students' characteristics in a sample (n=278) of youth in 5th-grade classrooms with the assumption that certain student characteristics may either prime or hinder teachers' attunement to aggressive students. Teacher attunement was measured as the agreement between teacher- and peer-nominations for students who start fights. Teachers rated their students on the following characteristics: academic competence, affiliation, popularity, internalizing behavior, and Olympian qualities. Higher affiliation, popularity, and internalizing behavior were associated with decreased odds for teacher attunement to aggressive youth. Higher Olympian qualities were associated with increased odds for teacher attunement to aggressive youth. Implications for interventions are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 43:263-272, 2017.

Microbial source tracking (MST) and chemical source tracking (CST) markers were utilized to identify fecal contamination in harvested rainwater and gutter debris samples. Throughout the sampling period, Bacteroides HF183 was detected in 57.5 % of the tank water samples and 95 % of the gutter debris samples, while adenovirus was detected in 42.5 and 52.5 % of the tank water and gutter debris samples, respectively. Human adenovirus was then detected at levels ranging from below the detection limit to 316 and 1253 genome copies/mu L in the tank water and debris samples, respectively. Results for the CST markers showed that salicylic acid (average 4.62 mu g/L) was the most prevalent marker (100 %) in the gutter debris samples, caffeine (average 18.0 mu g/L) was the most prevalent in the tank water samples (100 %) and acetaminophen was detected sporadically throughout the study period. Bacteroides HF183 and salicylic acid (95 %) and Bacteroides HF183 and caffeine (80 %) yielded high concurrence frequencies in the gutter debris samples. In addition, the highest concurrence frequency in the tank water samples was observed for Bacteroides HF183 and caffeine (60 %). The current study thus indicates that Bacteroides HF183, salicylic acid and caffeine may potentially be applied as source tracking markers in rainwater catchment systems in order to supplement fecal indicator analyses.	4.3
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a popular model system for investigating development, tissue regeneration, and repair. Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between self-renewal and lineage commitment in PSCs, the spatiotemporal integration of responsive signaling pathways with core transcriptional regulatory networks are complex and only partially understood. Moreover, measurements made on populations of cells reveal only average properties of the underlying regulatory networks, obscuring their fine detail. Here, we discuss the reconstruction of regulatory networks in individual cells using novel single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, in order to expand our understanding of the molecular basis of pluripotency, including the role of cell-cell variability within PSC populations, and ways in which networks may be controlled in order to reliably manipulate cell behavior.	6.1
A fully integrated low-dropout-regulated step-down multiphase-switched-capacitor DC-DC converter (a.k.a. charge pump, CP) with a fast-response adaptive-phase (Fast-RAP) digital controller is designed using a 65-nm CMOS process. Different from conventional designs, a low-dropout regulator (LDO) with an NMOS power stage is used without the need for an additional step-up CP for driving. A clock tripler and a pulse divider are proposed to enable the Fast-RAP control. As the Fast-RAP digital controller is designed to be able to respond faster than the cascaded linear regulator, transient response will not be affected by the adaptive scheme. Thus, light-load efficiency is improved without sacrificing the response time. When the CP operates at 90 MHz with 80.3% CP efficiency, only small ripples would appear on the CP output with the 18-phase interleaving scheme, and be further attenuated at VOUT by the 50-mV dropout regulator with only 4.1% efficiency overhead and 6.5% area overhead. The output ripple is less than 2 mV for a load current of 20 mA.	1.4
The study involved performance evaluation of a Multistage Jatropha Fruit Shelling Machine (PI2015701163) which is used to produce Jatropha kernels (oil-rich nucleus) with higher purity by removing both the outer shells of fruits and husks (seeds' coating). The reduction of shells and husks together, which is not commonly practised at the moment, can improve oil yield and quality during oil extraction process in biodiesel production. The shelling machine consists of two cracking unit with each having different roller clearance for different stage of decortications. Every roller was featured with male threads on the surface. The male threads in different rotating directions and speeds can provoke more shearing effect onto the loaded Jatropha fruits. The machine design also deploys multistage separation mechanisms consisting of vibratory sieve and blowers for a purpose to produce cleaner kernels. The designed machine has been tested at different blower air speeds and fruit moisture contents. The optimal air speed and fruit moisture content were found to be 9.8 +/- 0.4 m s(-1) and around 5.7% w.b. respectively, where the husks could be removed without causing high kernel loss. The overall results show that the designed machine at the optimal conditions was able to remove 99% of shells and 52% of husks while controlling the kernel loss at around 5%. Further, the separation process which applies blower as separation mean has been further analysed using Eulerian Model and Dense Discrete Phase Model (DDPM) in ANSYS Fluent, for a purpose to understand the behaviour of Jatropha fruits' particles under air flow during the separation process. The simulation revealed that some vortices have existed at converging portion or slope end of the designed separator duct due to instantaneous changes of air velocity and pressure. The formation of vortices could change the flowing direction of particles and lengthen the residence time of the particles in the duct. The phenomena were also found able to cause momentum loss of heavier kernel particles, achieving reduction of kernel loss during the separation process. The simulation results have provided a basis to understand the dynamics of multiphase flow. Further, the numerical model makes the study possible to provide a better insight for making a decision along with future developed scaling factor for machine scaled up activity.

Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR) propulsion is a viable and meritorious option for human exploration into deep-space because of its high thrust, improved specific impulse, well established technology, bimodal capability, and enhanced mission safety and reliability. The NTR technology has already been investigated and tested by the United States of America and Russia and the former Soviet Union. The representative Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications (NERVA) type reactors traditionally used Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) fuels, shaped in hexagonal fuel element geometries because of the importance of making a high power reactor with a minimum size. Although the HEU-NTR designs are the best choice in terms of rocket performance and technical maturity, they inevitably provoke nuclear proliferation obstacles not only for all research and development activities by civilians and non-nuclear weapon states but also for potential commercialization. To overcome the security issues due to HEU, the non proliferative, small-size NTR engine with low thrust levels of 41 kN-53 kN (9.2 klb(f) similar to 11.9 klb(f)), Korea Advanced NUclear Thermal Engine Rocket utilizing a Low-Enriched Uranium fuel (KANUTER-LEU), is being designed for future generations. Its design goals are to make use of an LEU fuel for its fairly compact core, but to minimize the rocket performance sacrifice relative to the traditional HEU-NTRs. To achieve these goals, a new space propulsion reactor is conceptually designed with the key concepts of a high uranium density fuel with resistance against high heating and H-2 corrosion, a thermal neutron spectrum core, and a compact and integrated fuel element core design with protective cooling capability. In addition, a preliminary design study of neutronics and thermal-hydraulics was performed to explore the design space of the new LEU-NTR reactor concept. The result indicates that the innovative reactor concept has great potential, both to implement the use of an LEU fuel and to create comparable rocket performance, compared to the existing HEU-NTR designs.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between social cognition (SC) and cognitive impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). A prospective study was conducted in 60 PwMS, 30 with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), 15 with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and 15 with primary progressive MS (PPMS), and in healthy subjects (HS). All subjects were assessed by the Bordeaux Social Cognition Evaluation Protocol (PECS-B) (facial emotion recognition, theory of mind, emotional awareness and cognitive and affective alexithymia), by a large neuropsychological battery and by questionnaires (depression and anxiety). 43.3% of PwMS were impaired for at least one SC test. The proportion of PwMS with at least two impaired SC tests was similar in all three phenotypes (20%). Mean scores differed significantly between PwMS and HS only for the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, a test of Theory of Mind (ToM). ANOVA analyses showed an effect of phenotype on emotional awareness scores with lower scores in PPMS as compared to RRMS. ToM performance was significantly correlated (r (2) = 0.56) with executive functions, working memory and episodic memory scores. SC impairment was found in all phenotypes and was more prominent in cognitively impaired MS patients. Executive functions, and working and episodic memory performance accounts for approximately 50% of ToM performance. Emotional awareness is more impaired in progressive MS.	2.1
The kernel model has been part of operating system architecture for decades, but upon closer inspection it clearly violates the principle of least required privilege. The kernel is a single entity which provides many services (memory management, interfacing to drivers, context switching, IPC) having no real relation to each other, and has the ability to observe or tamper with all state of the system. This work presents Antikernel, a novel operating system architecture consisting of both hardware and software components and designed to be fundamentally more secure than the state of the art. To make formal verification easier, and improve parallelism, the Antikernel system is highly modular and consists of many independent hardware state machines ( one or more of which may be a general-purpose CPU running application or systems software) connected by a packet-switched network-on-chip (NoC). We create and verify an FPGA-based prototype of the system.	0.4
Incidences of food allergies are on the rise, which can greatly affect the well-being of children as well as adults. Intolerance to gluten, a protein composite of gliadin and glutenin, present in wheat, barley, and rye and several cereals, can be the causative agent of celiac disease (CD) and other allergic reactions. A gluten-free diet has become essential for people affected by CD, and consequently, the amount of gluten in food products needs to be strictly controlled. In this paper, we report an electrochemical label-free immunosensor for ultrasensitive and specific detection of gliadin. The sensor takes advantage of the specific properties of porous reduced graphene oxide (prGO) covalently functionalized with anti-gliadin antibodies using 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid as linker molecule. Using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and [Fe(CN)6](3-/4-) as a redox probe, a decrease of current is linked to the presence of gliadin. The sensor achieved a detection limit of 1.2 ng mL(-1) over a 1.2-34 ng mL(-1) linear range with high selectivity. The advantages offered by this sensor are the possibility to regenerate the surface of the immunosensor, its rapid and ease of production, as well as applicability for the screening of gliadin concentrations in real food samples, as shown here.	5.1
This study extends the research of the third-person effect by examining the effect of time span of media message on perceptual and behavioral components of the third-person effect. Using a survey of Hong Kong residents, the study explores perceived media effect of the news coverage of a short- and a long-term issue and the predictor of intention to take action to reduce negative effect. The results revealed no third-person effect by the short-term messages and the reverse third-person effect (first-person effect) by the long-term messages. There was a significant difference in discrepancy between the perceived media effect on self and others (third-person perception) produced by the messages of the short- and long-term issue. The study also found that perceived media effect on self is a stronger predictor of intention to take action to reduce the negative effects of the short- and long-term issue than the third-person effect.	2.2
Honey bees and the business of beekeeping have profound economic importance for global agricultural production. Bee populations and the beekeeping industry are experiencing threats to sustainability. The beekeeping industry brings with it health risks for beekeepers and those living in proximity to hives. While there are a wide range of potential adverse health outcomes there has been no systematic review of these. We address this gap, examining the symptomatic adverse health outcomes among beekeepers and those living in proximity to hives. We demonstrate a dearth of published studies (nine unique studies) on the health impacts. Adverse outcomes included bee venom and propolis allergies (including anaphylaxis) and Lyme borreliosis associated with tick bites while beekeeping. Systemic reactions to bee venom allergies were associated with a range of risk factors. However, the probability of allergic reactions decreased as years of beekeeping increased. There is a clear need for greater research into the adverse health outcomes for this population. Nevertheless, our systematic review demonstrates important health consequences, and suggests an appreciation of the range of consequences is relevant. This is appropriate for reducing the disease burden of beekeeping in order to facilitate greater participation and aid in maintaining global pollination services and food security.	5.1
Nocturnal rodents play a key role in the Sonoran Desert ecosystem as consumers, prey and reservoirs of disease-yet rodent distribution remains poorly mapped. We use surface temperature extracted from the Landsat Thematic Mapper thermal infrared band to model rodent abundance obtained from trapping data at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in southwest Arizona. We produce response curves that describe the effects of surface temperature on species abundance. Daytime surface temperature derived from images collected in June across thirty rodent trapping grids ranged from 318 K (45.0 degrees C) to 332 K (59.2 degrees C). Results show peak seasonal surface temperature splits high species abundances into two groups: Merriam's kangaroo rat, Arizona pocket mouse, desert pocket mouse and southern grasshopper mouse species prefer habitat characterized by higher surface temperatures; and white-throated wood rat, cactus mouse, rock pocket mouse and Bailey's pocket mouse species prefer habitat characterized by lower temperatures. Abundances for the high and low temperature habitat groupings correlate linearly with surface temperature (r = +0.66 and -0.75, respectively, p < 0.001). Surface temperature integrates multiple landscape characteristics (e.g. topography, vegetation cover and soil properties) that define the dominant habitats of ORPI rodents. These results prove that simple models can inform complex ecological processes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.2
This paper presents an effective technique for both synchronization and secure communication. In particular, an adaptive sliding mode observer is developed and practically implemented. Only one component of the state vector of the transmitter, that satisfies the observability matching condition, is sent to the receiver via a public channel, which is a sliding mode observer. This observer is able to estimate the state vector of the transmitter and then, reconstruct the unknown information hidden in the transmitted with inclusion encryption. Finally, the chaotic secure communication system is simulated with matlab and then practically implemented by electrical circuits with Multisim software and Ultiboard software.	1.2
Land surface albedo is an essential variable for surface energy and climate modeling as it describes the proportion of incident solar radiant flux that is reflected from the Earth's surface. To capture the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of the land surface, satellite remote sensing must be used to monitor albedo accurately at a global scale. However, large data gaps caused by cloud or ephemeral snow have slowed the adoption of satellite albedo products by the climate modeling community. To address the needs of this community, we used a number of temporal and spatial gap-filling strategies to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of the global land surface MODIS BRDF, albedo and NBAR products. A rigorous evaluation of the gap-filled values shows good agreement with original high quality data (RMSE =0.027 for the NIR band albedo, 0.020 for the red band albedo). This global snow-free and cloud free MODIS BRDF and albedo dataset (established from 2001 to 2015) offers unique opportunities to monitor and assess the impact of the changes on the Earth's land surface.

The concepts expressed by social role terms such as artist and scientist are unique in that they seem to allow two independent criteria for categorization, one of which is inherently normative (Knobe, Prasada, & Newman, 2013). This study presents and tests an account of the content and structure of the normative dimension of these dual character concepts. Experiment 1 suggests that the normative dimension of a social role concept represents the commitment to fulfill the idealized basic function associated with the role. Background information can affect which basic function is associated with each social role. However, Experiment 2 indicates that the normative dimension always represents the relevant commitment as an end in itself. We argue that social role concepts represent the commitments to basic functions because that information is crucial to predict the future social roles and role-dependent behavior of others.	2.1
Direct gaze is a salient social cue that affords rapid detection. A body of research suggests that direct gaze enhances performance on memory tasks (e.g., Hood, Macrae, Cole-Davies, & Dias, Developmental Science, 1, 67-71, 2003). Nonetheless, other studies highlight the disruptive effect direct gaze has on concurrent cognitive processes (e.g., Conty, Gimmig, Belletier, George, & Huguet, Cognition, 115(1), 133-139, 2010). This discrepancy raises questions about the effects direct gaze may have on concurrent memory tasks. We addressed this topic by employing a change detection paradigm, where participants retained information about the color of small sets of agents. Experiment 1 revealed that, despite the irrelevance of the agents' eye gaze to the memory task at hand, participants were worse at detecting changes when the agents looked directly at them compared to when the agents looked away. Experiment 2 showed that the disruptive effect was relatively short-lived. Prolonged presentation of direct gaze led to recovery from the initial disruption, rather than a sustained disruption on change detection performance. The present study provides the first evidence that direct gaze impairs visual working memory with a rapidly-developing yet short-lived effect even when there is no need to attend to agents' gaze.	2.1
Region-based hierarchical image representation is crucial in many computer vision applications. However, in practice, an image hierarchy is usually dense, and contains many less informative branches. It is expected that a hierarchy should be accurate and simplified, which is not only desirable for different applications, but also saves considerable computational load for the further analysis. To achieve this target, this paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised simplification of region-based image hierarchies, which employs the global and local evolution analyses of a hierarchy. First, we introduce a global evolution analysis in the scale-sets framework, which provides clues for eliminating less informative branches. Moreover, a hybrid unsupervised simplification method is designed, utilizing the information from global and local evolution functions. A number of experiments on various images have shown that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in removing less informative nodes (averagely about 90% of the whole nodes), while preserving salient image details and retaining the accuracy.	0.0
Background: Functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) are one promising tool for detecting specific molecular targets and combine molecular biology and nanotechnology aiming at modern imaging. We aimed at ligand-directed delivery with a suitable target-biomarker to detect early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Promising targets are galectins (Gal), due to their strong expression in and on PDAC-cells and occurrence at early stages in cancer precursor lesions, but not in adjacent normal tissues. Results: Molecular probes (10-29 AA long peptides) derived from human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) were selected as binding partners to galectins. Affinity constants between the synthesized t-PA peptides and Gal were determined by microscale thermophoresis. The 29 AA-long t-PA-peptide-1 with a lactose-functionalized serine revealed the strongest binding properties to Gal-1 which was 25-fold higher in comparison with the native t-PA protein and showed additional strong binding to Gal-3 and Gal-4, both also over-expressed in PDAC. t-PA-peptide-1 was selected as vector moiety and linked covalently onto the surface of biodegradable iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs). In particular, CAN-doped maghemite NPs (CAN-Mag), promising as contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were selected as magnetic core and coated with different biocompatible polymers, such as chitosan (CAN-Mag-Chitosan NPs) or polylactic co glycolic acid (PLGA) obtaining polymeric nanoparticles (CAN-Mag@PNPs), already approved for drug delivery applications. The binding efficacy of t-PA-vectorized NPs determined by exposure to different pancreatic cell lines was up to 90%, as assessed by flow cytometry. The in vivo targeting and imaging efficacy of the vectorized NPs were evaluated by applying murine pancreatic tumor models and assessed by 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The t-PA-vectorized NPs as well as the protease-activated NPs with outer shell decoration (CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac) showed clearly detectable drop of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor staining-intensity indicating a considerable uptake of the injected NPs. Post mortem NP deposition in tumors and organs was confirmed by Fe staining of histopathology tissue sections. Conclusions: The targeted NPs indicate a fast and enhanced deposition of NPs in the murine tumor models. The CAN-Mag@PNPs-PEG-REGAcp-PEG/tPA-pep1Lac interlocking steps strategy of NPs delivery and deposition in pancreatic tumor is promising.	6.0
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a branch of Public-Key cryptography that is widely accepted for secure data exchange in many resource-limited devices. This paper presents a novel hardware cryptographic processor for ECC over general prime field GF(p). It is optimized on circuit level by introducing new parallel modular multiplication algorithm with its efficient hardware architecture, which offers significant improvement over the previously used techniques. Subsequently, on the system level, it is optimized by exploiting available high degree of parallelism using projective coordinates by incorporating four parallel multiplier units. The proposed hardware is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-4 and Virtex-6 field programmable gate arrays. A 256-bit scalar multiplication is completed in 1.43ms and 2.96ms in a cycle count of 2071K on Virtex-6 and Virtex-4 field programmable gate array paltforms, respectively. The Virtex-6 implementation attains a maximum frequency of 144MHz, occupies 324K look-up-tables, whereas on Virtex-4 it is about 70MHz with 357K slices. The results show that the proposed design offers a significant improvement in computation time with a significant reduction in cycle count as compared with the other reported designs. Therefore, it is a good choice to be used in many ECC-based schemes. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	0.3
Several studies have demonstrated that women show a greater interest for social information and empathic attitude than men. This article reviews studies on sex differences in the brain, with particular reference to how males and females process faces and facial expressions, social interactions, pain of others, infant faces, faces in things (pareidolia phenomenon), opposite-sex faces, humans vs. landscapes, incongruent behavior, motor actions, biological motion, erotic pictures, and emotional information. Sex differences in oxytocin-based attachment response and emotional memory are also mentioned. In addition, we investigated how 400 different human faces were evaluated for arousal and valence dimensions by a group of healthy male and female University students. Stimuli were carefully balanced for sensory and perceptual characteristics, age, facial expression, and sex. As a whole, women judged all human faces as more positive and more arousing than men. Furthermore, they showed a preference for the faces of children and the elderly in the arousal evaluation. Regardless of face aesthetics, age, or facial expression, women rated human faces higher than men. The preference for opposite-vs. same-sex faces strongly interacted with facial age. Overall, both women and men exhibited differences in facial processing that could be interpreted in the light of evolutionary psychobiology. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2.1
Social class predicts numerous important life outcomes and social orientations. To date, literature has mainly examined how an individual's own class shapes interactions with others. But how prosocially do people treat others they perceive as coming from lower, middle, or higher social classes? Here, in addition to testing effects of self social class on prosocial behavior, we also investigate how target social class affects prosocialbehavior, operationalized using a social mindfulness paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice to others. We offer three lines of reasoning, predicting that lower class targets either elicit greater prosociality than higher class targets (fairness), that higher class targets elicit greater prosociality (status), or that people are most prosocial to targets from their own social class (similarity). Across four studies, we find that participants behave less prosocially (i.e., are less socially mindful) toward higher class targets relative to lower and/or middle class targets. Perceptions of similarity, warmth, and competence did not mediate lower prosociality for higher relative to lower class targets. Together, results are most consistent with a fairness perspective. Across all studies, we also found that self social class had little to no relationship with prosociality. In total, results suggest that social class is relevant for prosocial behavior, but that target social class matters more than self social class. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.4
Some optimal control problems for linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations related to the optimal switching between different magnetic fields are considered. The main aim is to move an electrical initial current by a controllable voltage in shortest time to a desired terminal current and to hold it afterwards. Necessary optimality conditions are derived by Pontryagin's principle and a formal Lagrange technique. In the case of a linear system, the principal structure of time-optimal controls is discussed. The associated optimality systems are solved by a one-shot strategy using a multigrid software package. Various numerical examples are discussed. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	1.2
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is characterized by progressive deterioration of frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain and often exhibits frontotemporal dementia (FTD) on clinic, in < 65-year-old patients at the time of diagnosis. Interdisciplinary approaches combining genetics, molecular and cell biology, and laboratory animal science have revealed some of its potential molecular mechanisms. Although there is still no effective treatment to delay, prevent, and reverse the progression of FTD, emergence of agents targeting molecular mechanisms has been beginning to promote potential pharmaceutical development. Our review summarizes the latest new findings of FTLD and challenges in FTLD therapy.	6.1
Appreciative joy (or sympathetic joy) refers to feeling happiness for others and is one of the four prosocial attitudes (four immeasurables) cultivated by loving-kindness meditation in Buddhism. The current study included 1622 participants and developed a scale to measure appreciative joy for friends in daily life. Both an exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in an appreciative joy scale consisting of three components: sense of joy, positive interpersonal bias, and self-transcendence (study 1). The appreciative joy scale exhibited high correlations with measurements for interpersonal relationships and four immeasurables. The scale also shows incremental contributions to positive emotions, satisfaction with life, trait happiness, and peace of mind after controlling for interpersonal relationships or the four immeasurables (studies 2 and 3). The scale exhibited higher scores among Buddhists than among individuals with no religious belief, and its structure was maintained across English and Chinese samples (study 4); in addition, it demonstrated good test-retest reliability (study 5). Overall, the current study validated the scale as a useful tool for measuring appreciative joy, and certain findings also highlighted directions for future research on appreciative joy, including causal relationships with positive emotions, comparisons with compassion, and effects on envy.	2.4
Glucocorticoids play diverse roles in almost all physiological systems of the body, including both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive roles. Synthetic glucocorticoids are one of the most widely prescribed drugs and are used in the treatment of conditions such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, ocular disorders and certain types of cancers. In the interest of investigating glucocorticoid actions in the cornea of the eye, we established that multiple cell types in mouse corneas express functional glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with corneal epithelial cells having robust expression. To define glucocorticoid actions in a cell type-specific manner, we employed immortalized human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line to define the glucocorticoid transcriptome and elucidated its functions in corneal epithelial cells. Over 4000 genes were significantly regulated within 6 h of dexamethasone treatment, and genes associated with cell movement, cytoskeletal remodeling and permeability were highly regulated. Real-time in vitro wound healing assays revealed that glucocorticoids delay wound healing by attenuating cell migration. These functional alterations were associated with cytoskeletal remodeling at the wounded edge of a scratch wounded monolayer. However, glucocorticoid treatment improved the organization of tight-junction proteins and enhanced the epithelial barrier function. Our results demonstrate that glucocorticoids profoundly alter corneal epithelial gene expression and many of these changes likely impact both wound healing and epithelial cell barrier function.

We propose a computationally efficient probabilistic modeling, methodology to estimate the adverse effects on humans of exposure to contaminated groundwater. Our work is aligned with the standard suggested by the regulatory agencies and allows to propagate uncertainty from hydrogeological, toxicological and behavioral parameters to the final health risk endpoint. The problem under consideration consists of a contaminated aquifer supplying water to a population. Contamination stems from a continuous source that feeds a steady plume which constitutes the hazard source. This scenario is particularly suited for NAPL pollutants. The erratic displacement of the contaminant plume in groundwater, due to the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, is characterized within the Lagrangian stochastic framework which enables the complete probabilistic characterization of the contaminant concentration at an environmentally sensitive location. Following the probabilistic characterization of flow and transport, we quantify the adverse health effects on humans. The dose response assessment involves the estimation of the uncertain effects of the exposure to a given contaminant while accounting for the exposed individual's metabolism. The model integrates groundwater transport, exposure and human metabolism in a comprehensive probabilistic framework which allows the assessment of the risk probability through a novel simple analytical solution. Aside from its computational efficiency, the analytical features of the framework allows the assessment of uncertainty arising from the hydrogeological parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a protection method for fingerprint templates by using fused structures at the feature level. The authors compute two transformed features from minutiae points: namely, local structure and distant structure. These structures are represented as bit-strings. A fusion on bit-strings is done at the feature level to produce a cancelable template. An equal error rate (EER) of 2.19, 1.6 and 6.14% on Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC) 2002 Database (DB)1 through DB3 databases and an EER of 11.89, 12.71, 17.6% on FVC 2004 DB1 through DB3 proves the tenability of the proposed method.	0.3
We develop linear representation theory for bicircular matroids, a chief example being a matroid associated with forests of a graph, and bicircular lift matroids, a chief example being a matroid associated with spanning forests. (These are bias and lift matroids of contrabalanced biased graphs.) The theory is expressed largely in terms of antivoltages (edge labellings that defy Kirchhoff's voltage law) with values in the multiplicative or additive group of the scalar field. We emphasize antivoltages with values in cyclic groups and finite vector spaces since they are crucial for representing the matroids over finite fields; and integer-valued antivoltages with bounded breadth since they are crucial in constructions. We find bounds for the existence of antivoltages and we solve some examples. Other results: The number of antivoltages in an abelian group is a polynomial function of the group order, and the number of integral antivoltages with bounded breadth is a polynomial in the breadth bound. We conclude with an application to complex representation. There are many open questions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	1.3
The Smart Grid control systems need to be protected from internal attacks within the perimeter. In Smart Grid, the Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) are resource-constrained devices that do not have the ability to provide security analysis and protection by themselves. And the commonly used industrial control system protocols offer little security guarantee. To guarantee security inside the system, analysis and inspection of both internal network traffic and device status need to be placed close to IEDs to provide timely information to power grid operators. For that, we have designed a unique, extensible and efficient operation-level traffic analyzer framework. The timing evaluation of the analyzer overhead confirms efficiency under Smart Grid operational traffic.	0.2
Automatic registration of multimodal remote sensing data [e.g., optical, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)] is a challenging task due to the significant nonlinear radiometric differences between these data. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel feature descriptor named the histogram of orientated phase congruency (HOPC), which is based on the structural properties of images. Furthermore, a similarity metric named HOPCncc is defined, which uses the normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) of the HOPC descriptors for multimodal registration. In the definition of the proposed similarity metric, we first extend the phase congruency model to generate its orientation representation and use the extended model to build HOPCncc. Then, a fast template matching scheme for this metric is designed to detect the control points between images. The proposed HOPCncc aims to capture the structural similarity between images and has been tested with a variety of optical, LiDAR, SAR, and map data. The results show that HOPCncc is robust against complex nonlinear radiometric differences and outperforms the state-ofthe- art similarities metrics (i.e., NCC and mutual information) in matching performance. Moreover, a robust registration method is also proposed in this paper based on HOPCncc, which is evaluated using six pairs of multimodal remote sensing images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multimodal image registration.	4.2
Introduction: An impairment of visually perceiving backward masked stimuli is commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia, yet it is unclear whether this impairment is the result of a deficiency in first or higher order processing and for which subtypes of schizophrenia it is present. Methods: Here, we compare identification (first order) and metacognitive (higher order) performance in a visual masking paradigm between a highly homogenous group of young firstepisode patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (N = 11) to that of carefully matched healthy controls (N = 13). Results: We find no difference across groups in first-order performance, but find a difference in metacognitive performance, particularly for stimuli with relatively high visibility. Conclusions: These results indicate that the masking deficit is present in first-episode patients with paranoid schizophrenia, but that it is primarily an impairment of metacognition.	2.1
Aims and objectives. To evaluate caregiver burden and factors that influence this burden among caregivers and patients with Alzheimer's disease in China. Background. Long-term care can reduce the quality of life for caregivers and result in both mental and physical exhaustion. However, little is known about caregiver burden and associated factors in China. Design. The study had a quantitative cross-sectional design. Methods. A total of 309 caregivers and their patients were included in the study. The patients' cognitive, psychological and functional status and their caregivers' burden, sleep quality and mental state were evaluated. Descriptive analyses, single-factor regression and stepwise factor regression were used to determine the effects of various factors on caregiver burden. Results. Older females and spouses still play an important role in providing family care for those with dementia. Most of the caregivers were the sole full-time caregiver and had little time for themselves. Sleepiness was a common physical problem for caregivers, and some of them had moderate to severe depression and anxiety. A lower functional status of the patient was associated with higher caregiver burden. Poorer physical status compared with before caregiving began, lower life satisfaction, and higher degrees of depression and anxiety were associated with higher caregiver burden. Conclusion. Depression, anxiety and sleep problems are the main challenges that are faced by family caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Caregivers' functional status, lower life satisfaction, depression and anxiety influenced caregiver burden. Caregiver burden was related to the severity of the patient's dementia and the personal factors of the caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice. To provide information about caregivers' current status while caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease and to understand caregiver burden and its related factors. Professionals who work with Alzheimer's disease should pay more attention to caregiver burden, especially those with mental and physical problems.	5.2
Corticosteroids are an important part of the pharmacological armamentarium against a wide spectrum of diseases. They are powerful drugs that effect all aspects of human metabolism and, although often life-saving, they have a plethora of important side-effects and a narrow therapeutic window. Most side-effects aria well known to physicians but we would like to highlight the problem of avascular necrosis associated with cyclical steroid therapy of short duration using moderate doses for an unusual indication.	6.2
Transportation Engineers face many problems in using Sand Dunes available in huge quantities through the desert areas in Iraq as construction Materials for Roads. This study consists of using Sand Dunes as local material in road construction. Two approaches are adopted to achieve this goal; the first is carrying out laboratory tests through simulation of three layers of paved road, using a steel box model where Subgrade layer represented by Sand Dunes at relative density 55.7% (in situe Value). The study oriented as well to the improvement of sand dunes through using reinforcement with two types of Geosynthetic material. Two models were studied, one of which is reinforced by single layer of geotextile at subbase-subgrade interface and the other using single layer of geogrid at the same depth to improve the subgrade, grouting technique is used through the injection of the subgrade with a mixture of cement, bentonite, and water. Using of geotextile and geogrid, leads to increase the number of passes 108.53%, 78.05% respectively. The using of injection technique increase the number of passes about 18.29%. FE approach using Abaqus program was applied to find out displacement distribution through build pavement structure model. The results obtained from both laboratory and finite elements are very much encouraging with using Sand Dune as construction materials for Roads. However, using reinforcement in between subbase-subgrade interface also satisfied the minimum stability requirements for roads foundation structure with sand dunes as subgrade layer.	4.1
A kinesthetic classroom activity was designed to help students understand enzyme activity and catalysis of reaction rate. Students served the role of enzymes by manipulating Pop-It Beads as the catalytic event. This activity illuminates the relationship between reaction rate and reaction progress by allowing students to experience first-hand the effect of substrate depletion on catalyzed reaction rate. Preliminary findings based on survey results and exam performance suggest the activity could prove beneficial to students in the targeted learning outcomes. Unique to previous kinesthetic approaches that model Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this activity models the effects of substrate depletion on catalyzed reaction rate. Therefore, it could prove beneficial for conveying the reasoning behind the initial rate simplification used in Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

In this paper, a single current sensor technique (SCST) is proposed for single-phase full-bridge inverters. The proposed SCST measures the currents of multiple branches at the same time, and reconstructs the average inductor, capacitor, and load current in a single switching cycle. Since all of the branches' current in the LC filter and the load are obtained using the SCST, both the inductor and the capacitor current feedback schemes can be selectively applied while taking advantages of each other. This paper also analyzes both of the current feedback schemes from the view point of the closed-loop output impedance. The proposed SCST and the analysis in this paper are verified through experiments on a 3kVA single-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS).	1.4
Concerns about pesticide exposure through food consumption have increased during the past several years. Pyrethroids are applied as insecticides throughout the world. Human metabolism of pyrethroids results in urinary metabolites that are suitable for biological monitoring. The objective of our study was to investigate the relation between food consumption and urinary levels of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), a general metabolite of pyrethroids, in a non-occupational exposed adult population from the IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy. Information on sodo-demographic characteristics, smoking, diet and self-reported household pesticide exposure was collected. Urinary 3-PBA level of each subject was measured and adjusted by urinary creatinine. We found that people consuming both raw and cooked vegetables five times weekly or more had higher mean levels of 3-PBA in urine (1.03 mu g/g creatinine versus 0.52 mu g/g creatinine; p = 0.009 and 0.99 mu g/g creatinine versus 0.58 mu g/g creatinine; p = 0.01, respectively) than subjects consuming less than five times weekly. In a multivariate model, after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking and household insecticide exposure, high intake of raw vegetables (OR: 5.31; 95%Cl: 1.32-213) and high intake of cooked vegetables, in particular cruciferous (OR: 4.67; 95%CI: 1.07-20.5) and leafy vegetables (OR: 6.88; 95%Cl: 1.50-31.7), were associated with high urine 3-PBA levels (>= 0.70 mu g/g creatinine). The results of this study suggest that part of the variation in pyrethrois intake is explained by vegetable intake. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.2
The water chemistry and economics of a commercial-scale inland marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system was investigated. The system used a combination of a constructed wetland, sand filter followed by a constructed wetland, and geotextile bags to treat solids waste. This study is a demonstration of a zero-discharge system where commercial nursery production of wetland plants was combined with a marine RAS to treat saline solid waste. Total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured. Plant and soil samples were analyzed for TN and TP. A significant (p < 0.05) difference in the effluent concentrations was not found. The variability inherent in a commercial-scale system made it difficult to isolate the individual efficiencies of the three treatment systems. Production of wetland plants was critical for aiding nutrient removal by facilitating aggregation of solids and providing conditions for denitrification. On average the nitrate concentration decreased over time due to the denitrification occurring in the plant beds. Water samples were analyzed for dissolved metals: Mn, Ni, Se, Sr, Cd, Li, Hg, Mo, Fe, B, Cu, Pb, Zn, La, Ca, K, and Mg; Mn and Fe showed a gradual increase in concentration over time. This IMTA system successfully produced Florida pompano, and the fish waste and uneaten feed provided enough nutrients to produce multiple cohorts of wetland plants over a two-year period. An economic analysis indicated that after one year of production the system would produce a profit, but the production of Florida pompano alone would not result in a positive net return. The sales of wetland plants were necessary for the system to break-even and ultimately produce a profit for the production facility in Sarasota, FL. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.1
Over the past decade, salient object detection has attracted a lot of interests in computer-vision. Although many models have been proposed to detect the salient object in an arbitrary image, this problem is still plagued with complex backgrounds and scattered objects. To address this issue, in this paper, we explore the information in cross features via a diversity-induced multi-view regularization under the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). Based on the diversity term, a new matrix decomposition based model is proposed for salient object detection. Furthermore, S-1/2 regularizer is introduced to constrain the background part. This regularizer will make the background much cleaner in the saliency map. A group sparsity induced norm is imposed on the salient part in order to involve the potential spatial relationships of image patches. Our method is solved through an augmented Lagrange multipliers method, and high-level priors are also integrated to boost the performance. Experiments on the four widely used datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models.	0.0
Rainwater harvesting techniques are used worldwide to augment potable water supply, provide water for small-scale irrigation practices, increase rainwater-use efficiency for sustained crop growth in arid and semi-arid regions, decrease urban stormwater flow volumes, and in general to relieve dependency on urban water resources cycles. A number of methods have been established in recent years to estimate reliability of rainwater catchment systems (RWCS) and thereby properly size the components (roof catchment area, storage tank size) of the system for a given climatic region. These methods typically use historical or stochastically-generated rainfall patterns to quantify system performance and optimally size the system, with the latter accounting for possible rainfall scenarios based on statistical relationships of historical rainfall patterns. To design RWCS systems that can sustainably meet water demand under future climate conditions, this paper introduces a method that employs climatic data from general circulation models (GCMs) to develop a suite of catchment area vs. storage size design curves that capture uncertainty in future climate scenarios. Monthly rainfall data for the 2010-2050 time period is statistically downscaled to daily values using a Markov chain algorithm, with results used only from GCMs that yield rainfall patterns that are statistically consistent with historical rainfall patterns. The process is demonstrated through application to two climatic regions of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the western Pacific, wherein the majority of the population relies on rainwater harvesting for potable water supply. Through the use of design curves, communities can provide household RWCS that achieve a certain degree of storage reliability. The method described herein can be applied generally to any geographic region. It can be used to first, assess the future performance of existing household systems; and second, to design or modify systems that will yield adequate storage for future climate conditions.

Contact problem, which exists widely in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, manufacturing engineering, etc., is an extremely complicated nonlinear problem. It is usually solved by the finite element method. Unlike with the traditional finite element method, it is necessary to set up contact elements for the contact analysis. In the different types of contact elements, the Goodman joint elements, which cover the surface of contacted bodies with zero thickness, are widely used. However, there are some debates on the characteristics of the attached elements of the Goodman joint elements. For that this paper studies the type, matching, and meshing of the attached elements. The results from this paper would be helpful for the finite element contact analysis.	3.2
DNA vaccine is a third generation vaccine type based on concepts and techniques of molecular biology. It can closely mimic live infections and induce both antibody and cell mediated immune responses and thus has much potential for treating chronic viral infection and cancer. How do we transport the DNA vaccine to the right target cells in lymphoid tissues and organs? How do we achieve high and robust gene transfection efficiency while simultaneously inducing DC maturation and antigen presentation? These questions pose significant challenges and addressing them may require serious efforts in developing better biomaterials as carriers. This review is dedicated to the discussion of polymers as nanoscale carriers for the DNA vaccine. We summarize recent advances in polymer science and engineering to overcome multilevel hurdles for DNA vaccine delivery and conclude with thoughts on challenges and opportunities that may shape the future of polymers in DNA vaccination.	6.0
As an entertainment technology, video games are a popular social activity that can allow for multiple players to cooperatively engage on-screen challenges. Emerging research has found that when people play together, the resulting teamwork can have beneficial impacts on their prosocial orientations after gameplay - especially when the players are cooperative with one another. The present study wanted to expand the scope of these beneficial interpersonal effects by considering both inter- and intrapersonal factors. In an experimental study (N = 115) we manipulated the difficulty of a game (easy or hard) and the behavior of a confederate teammate (supportive or unsupportive playing style). We found that neither coplayer supportiveness nor game difficulty had an effect on the expectations of a teammate's prosocial behavior or one's own prosocial behavior toward the teammate after the game (operationalized as willingness to share small amounts of money with one's teammate after playing). Increased expectations of prosocial behavior from one's teammate were related to one's own prosocial behaviors, independent of our manipulations. Considering these results, we propose alternative theoretical approaches to understanding complex social interactions in video games. Furthermore, we suggest to explore other types of manipulations of game difficulty and cooperation between video game players as well as alternative measures of prosocial behavior.	2.4
In manufacturing engineering, especially in machining process, the definition of a reference plane is the first essential step within the overall process. After the reference plane is applied at the component all other features are processed with reference to this basic plane. During any process the component has to be clamped in order to resist the processing forces. There are several clamping systems available, such as pneumatic, magnetic systems or magneto-rheological (MR) systems. Depending on its stiffness the component is deformed due to the clamping forces, stresses are introduced. This effect can be neglected for components with a high stiffness and nearly rigid body behaviour. However, the deformation of low stiff components under clamping forces, e.g. sheet metals, is relatively large and is in the same range as the addressed accuracy of machining process. Due to the introduced elastic clamping stresses the component will reconfigure after clamping, this phenomenon is known as springback. The focus of this work is the design of a clamping system for flexible bodies in order to reduce the springback and to enable high precision processing. This clamping system consists in a set of supports, which adjust to the surface of the body without introducing stresses and causing no springback after the machining process. The number and the arrangement of the supports are optimized as a function of the intensity and position of the milling force and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the body as well. The functional unit of the clamping system is a cylindrical bodysliding nearly frictionless within a pipe. Numerical simulation is used for configuration and optimization. The developed clamping systems can also be used to process freeform shaped bodies.	3.2
Background: The aim was to assess the influence of long-term treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors on total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and atherogenic index (AI) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on RA, PsA, and AS patients treated with TNF-a inhibitors for at least 270 days between 2001 and 2011. Levels of TC, TG, LDL, and HDL and the AI were compared with baseline values at 0-6, 6-12, 12-18, and 18-24 months. Patients were further subdivided into three groups according to their HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment status in order to assess their effect on the results. Results: The records of 311 patients (152 RA, 90 PsA, and 69 AS) were reviewed. TC and TG increased following treatment with TNF-a inhibitors, from 180.85 +/- 2.12 mg/dl and 116.00 +/- 3.55 mg/dl at baseline to 188.12 +/- 2.35 mg/dl (p = 0.02) and 132.02 +/- 4.63 mg/dl at 0-6 months (p < 0.01), respectively, and to 184.88 +/- 2.09 mg/dl (p = 0.02) and 129. 36 +/- 4.32 mg/dl at 18-24 months (p < 0.01), respectively. AI increased following treatment with TNF-a inhibitors, from - 0.032 +/- 0.017 at baseline to 0.004 +/- 0.019 at 18-24 months (p < 0.01). LDL decreased significantly in patients who were treated with statins before and during the entire study period, from 119.97 +/- 2.86 mg/dl at baseline to 104.02 +/- 3.57 mg/dl at 18-24 months (p < 0.01), in contrast to an increase in LDL values in patients who did not receive statins during the study. Conclusions: TNF-a inhibitor treatment was associated with a significant increase in TC and TG levels and the AI. Adding statins to the treatment was associated with a significant decrease in LDL levels.	5.3
We describe and evaluate a software-only implementation of a novel mechanism for accessing and streaming GPU-rendered content from the cloud to low-end user devices. The unique properties of our implementation enable the trivial cloud-deployment of graphics-intensive applications, even ones that were not originally intended to run in the cloud. We achieve this goal by creating virtual GPU nodes that appear to the application like hardware devices, but that do not incur the overhead of virtualization. The low-level access to the frame buffer maximizes the number of applications that work out-of-the-box without the system imposing any specific display manager or windowing system.	0.4
The art historian Ernst Gombrich asserted that both artists and viewers are constrained by specific cultural mental sets within which they operate: he used schemata to refer to both actual sketches and our mental sets. In mapping the mechanism of culture, Juri Lotman situated both language and the schematized image at the centre of semiospheres: they function to introduce unity and eliminate contradictions. Schemata have obviously served as both the cause and the result of human knowledge, some loosely constructed yet highly condensed forms of art in different domains. Theorizing at a time of a hypertrophy of scientific and linguistic models, Lotman and Gombrich appear to have converged on theorizing our means of connecting people across cultures. They each put forward their own perspectives concerning the interplay between culture, art and pictorial representation. This paper serves to: (1) examine how Lotman and Gombrich interpreted Jakobson's scheme of communication; (2) reveal the paradox of schemata and nonverbal communication latent in their writings; (3) soften the paradox by drawing on Lotman's conceptulization of play as an emotional structure. It is argued that the kind of emotive potential defined from the perspective of beholders or addressees is crucial to our survival in the global village.	2.3
Rolling stock examination is performed to identify the defects during train movements at speeds < 30 kmph. In this study, this process was automated using computer vision models. Parts on a moving train were segmented using four types of active contour-level set models: Chan-Vese (CV), CV-based morphological differential gradient (CV-MDG), CV with shape priors (CV-SP), and CV with shape invariance (CV-SI). CV level sets with shape invariance model enables the adjustment of contour according to scale, rotation, and location of the shape prior object in the rolling stock frame. Train rolling stock video data were captured at a high speed of 240 fps by using a sports action camera with 52 degrees wide angle lenses. The level sets yielded optimal segmentation results compared with traditional segmentation methods. The performance indicators of segmented parts from the proposed four algorithms are structural similarity index measure and peak signal-to-noise ratio (in dB). A total of 10 parts were extracted from a bogie by using the proposed models and compared against the ground truth models to test the performance of the methods. The train had 15 passenger cars with 30 bogies. Furthermore, the models were tested under various lighting conditions for five trains. The CV shape invariance model yielded more efficient segmentations both qualitatively and quantitatively.	0.0
A review of 92 heap leach projects from 15 countries provides a starting point for a series of experiments, at 22 degrees C and a vertical pressure of 2000 kPa, to examine short-term puncturing and the development of geomembrane strains that could affect longer-term performance. Underliners of gravel with some sand or those of gravel and sand caused significant puncturing and excessive strains in the geomembrane for the conditions examined. The shape of the underliner grading curve had a much greater effect on the potential for puncturing and the magnitude of the strains in the geomembrane than just the maximum particle size. Of the six granular underliners examined, the best performance was for the well graded gravelly sand with some silt which offered sufficient support to minimize the strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner while not inducing significant strains directly from the underliner. Nevertheless even in this case the maximum strain of 11% is almost double the maximum recommended in the literature for ensuring good long-term performance of the geomembrane. Consideration of composite liners with GCLs and compacted clay liners shows that the more deformable the foundation, the larger are the indentations and strains induced in the geomembrane by a given overliner. For the specific conditions examined, it is shown that there was no apparent improvement in performance for an LLDPE geomembrane versus the HDPE geomembrane tested. A 540 g/m(2) geotextile protection layer above the geomembrane was also found to be insufficient to prevent significant strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner examined.

Race and gender categories, although long presumed to be perceived independently, are inextricably tethered in social perception due in part to natural confounding of phenotypic cues. We predicted that target gender would affect race categorizations. Consistent with this hypothesis, feminine faces compelled White categorizations, and masculine faces compelled Asian or Black categorizations of racially ambiguous targets (Study 1), monoracial targets (Study 2), and real facial photographs (Study 3). The efficiency of judgments varied concomitantly. White categorizations were rendered more rapidly for feminine, relative to masculine faces, but the opposite was true for Asian and Black categorizations (Studies 1-3). Moreover, the effect of gender on categorization efficiency was compelled by racial phenotypicality for Black targets (Study 3). Finally, when targets' race prototypicality was held constant, gender still influenced race categorizations (Study 4). These findings indicate that race categorizations are biased by presumably unrelated gender cues.	2.2
The discovery of poly(ADP-ribose) >50 years ago opened a new field, leading the way for the discovery of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes and the ADP-ribosylation reactions that they catalyze. Although the field was initially focused primarily on the biochemistry and molecular biology of PARP-1 in DNA damage detection and repair, the mechanistic and functional understanding of the role of PARPs in different biological processes has grown considerably of late. This has been accompanied by a shift of focus from enzymology to a search for substrates as well as the first attempts to determine the functional consequences of site-specific ADP-ribosylation on those substrates. Supporting these advances is a host of methodological approaches from chemical biology, proteomics, genomics, cell biology, and genetics that have propelled new discoveries in the field. New findings on the diverse roles of PARPs in chromatin regulation, transcription, RNA biology, and DNA repair have been complemented by recent advances that link ADP-ribosylation to stress responses, metabolism, viral infections, and cancer. These studies have begun to reveal the promising ways in which PARPs may be targeted therapeutically for the treatment of disease. In this review, we discuss these topics and relate them to the future directions of the field.	6.0
Among many energy harvesting techniques with great potential, microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology is arguably the most underdeveloped. Even so, excitement is building, as microorganisms can harvest electrical power from any biodegradable organic source (e.g. wastewater) that is readily available in resource-limited settings. Nevertheless, the requirement for endless introduction of organic matter imposes a limiting factor to this technology, demanding an active feeding system and additional power. Here, we demonstrated self-sustaining bioelectricity generation from a microliter-scale microbial fuel cell (MFC) by using the syntrophic interaction between heterotrophic exoelectrogenic bacteria and phototrophs. The MFC continuously generated light-responsive electricity from the heterotrophic bacterial metabolic respiration with the organic substrates produced by photosynthetic bacteria. Without additional organic fuel, the mixed culture in a 90-mu L-chamber MFC generated self-sustained current for more than 13 days, while the heterotrophic culture produced current that decreased dramatically within a few hours. The current from the mixed culture was about 70 times greater than that of the device with only photosynthetic bacteria. The miniaturization provided a short start-up time, a well-controlled environment, and small internal resistance. Those advantages will become the general design platform for micropower generation.

Part of the Down syndrome behavioral phenotype is significant impairment in expressive communication. This begins early with impairments in verbal imitation and requesting observed in infants with Down syndrome. In contrast, social interaction is a relative strength. We replicated intervention procedures using social reinforcement and prompting (Feeley et al. 2011) to teach infants with Down syndrome to imitate sounds and engage in increasingly sophisticated forms of social and instrumental requests and examined generalization and collateral changes in intelligibility and problem solving. Infants learned to imitate verbalizations and make requests. They showed generalization by imitating novel sounds and requesting with different toys and on a semi structured assessment. Infants also showed verbal imitation that was intelligible to a naive listener and improvements in problem solving, suggesting this intervention may have broader effects than just requesting and verbal imitation.	2.3
Diabetes disrupts the operation of the eye and leads to vision loss, affecting particularly the nerve layer and capillary vessels in this layer by changes in the blood vessels of the retina. Suddenly loss and blurred vision problems occur in the image, depending on the phase of the disease, called diabetic retinopathy. Hard exudates are one of the primary signs of diabetic retinopathy. Automatic recognition of hard exudates in retinal images can contribute to detection of the disease. We present an automatic screening system for the detection of hard exudates. This system consists of two main steps. Firstly, the features were extracted from patch images consisting of hard exudate and normal regions using the DAISY algorithm based on the histogram of oriented gradients. After, we utilized the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method, using logistic regression (LR) and support vector classifier (SVC) estimators on the raw dataset. Therefore, we obtained two datasets containing the most important features. The number of important features in each dataset created with LR and SVC was 126 and 259, respectively. Afterward, we observed different classifier algorithms' performances by using 5-fold cross validation on these important features' dataset and it was observed that the random forest (RF) classifier is the best classifier. Secondly, we obtained important features from the feature vector that corresponds with the region of interest in accordance with the keypoint information in a new retinal fundus image. Then we performed detection of hard exudate regions on the retinal fundus image by using the RF classifier.	0.0
Significant improvements in treatment and the understanding of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia have occurred in the last 15 years. These diseases are almost always curable, and refractory patients have more options for salvage therapy. Recent improvements in the understanding of epidemiology, diagnosis, and cell biology have resulted in changes in staging, advances in treatment options, and opportunities for fertility preservation.

Construction of roads in soft soils is often associated with design and construction difficulties due to their compressibility nature and weak strength. Road pavements in such areas when subjected to traffic loading that are static and dynamic in nature experience a rapid deterioration of the base material and progressive permanent surface deformation. Both reduce serviceability, and subsequently, the design life of the pavement. In this study, reinforcement geosynthetics (geogrids and geotextiles) were used as reinforcement inclusions within a granular base underlying a soft subgrade having a California Bearing Ratio less than 2 % in a 1.0 m(3) steel test box. Bench scale plate load tests (static and cyclic) were conducted on a 305mm diameter circular steel plate on the two-layer system using a Universal Compression Machine. Static loading was applied at a rate of 1.2 mm/min. Dynamic sinusoidal load was superimposed atop a static hold down force of 4 kN. The dynamic load was linearly increased with an incremental load of 4 kN for every 8 cycles at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. For the tests, settlement failure of the composite system was considered at a deformation of 75mm as prescribed for unpaved roads. The results showed that there was a significant improvement in bearing capacity and reduction in settlement accruing from geosynthetic inclusion as shown by the bearing capacity ratio (BCR) of 1.21, 1.29, and 1.63 for geogrid, geotextile, and geogrid-geotextile combinations, respectively. Additionally, a settlement reduction factor (SRF) of 18 % for geogrid, 23 % for geotextile, and 31 % for the geogrid-geotextile combination resulted. There was also an improvement in extended pavement life as depicted by the traffic benefit ratio (TBR) greater than 1 for all reinforced base layers. Comparing geotextile and geogrid reinforced pavements, the results showed that geosynthetic tensile strength is not the governing performance indicator.	4.1
Several reports have described the presence of antibodies against Alzheimer's disease-associated hyperphosphorylated forms of tau in serum of healthy individuals. To characterize the specificities that can be found, we interrogated peripheral IgG(+) memory B cells from asymptomatic blood donors for reactivity to a panel of phosphorylated tau peptides using a single-cell screening assay. Antibody sequences were recovered, cloned, and expressed as full-length IgGs. In total, 52 somatically mutated tau-binding antibodies were identified, corresponding to 35 unique clonal families. Forty-one of these antibodies recognize epitopes in the proline-rich and C-terminal domains, and binding of 26 of these antibodies is strictly phosphorylation dependent. Thirteen antibodies showed inhibitory activity in a P301S lysate seeded in vitro tau aggregation assay. Two such antibodies, CBTAU-7.1 and CBTAU-22.1, which bind to the proline-rich and C-terminal regions of tau, respectively, were characterized in more detail. CBTAU-7.1 recognizes an epitope that is similar to that of murine anti-PHF antibody AT8, but has different phospho requirements. Both CBTAU-7.1 and CBTAU-22.1 detect pathological tau deposits in post-mortem brain tissue. CBTAU-7.1 reveals a similar IHC distribution pattern as AT8, immunostaining (pre) tangles, threads, and neuritic plaques. CBTAU-22.1 shows selective detection of neurofibrillary changes by IHC. Taken together, these results suggest the presence of an ongoing antigen-driven immune response against tau in healthy individuals. The wide range of specificities to tau suggests that the human immune repertoire may contain antibodies that can serve as biomarkers or be exploited for therapy.	5.2
Remote data integrity checking (RDIC) enables a data storage server, say a cloud server, to prove to a verifier that it is actually storing a data owner's data honestly. To date, a number of RDIC protocols have been proposed in the literature, but most of the constructions suffer from the issue of a complex key management, that is, they rely on the expensive public key infrastructure (PKI), which might hinder the deployment of RDIC in practice. In this paper, we propose a new construction of identity-based (ID-based) RDIC protocol by making use of key-homomorphic cryptographic primitive to reduce the system complexity and the cost for establishing and managing the public key authentication framework in PKI-based RDIC schemes. We formalize ID-based RDIC and its security model, including security against a malicious cloud server and zero knowledge privacy against a third party verifier. The proposed ID-based RDIC protocol leaks no information of the stored data to the verifier during the RDIC process. The new construction is proven secure against the malicious server in the generic group model and achieves zero knowledge privacy against a verifier. Extensive security analysis and implementation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is provably secure and practical in the real-world applications.	0.3
Psychological research on the relationship between spirituality/religion and mental health has grown considerably over the past several decades and now constitutes a sizable body of scholarship. Among dimensions of S/R, positive beliefs about God have been significantly related to better mental health outcomes, and conversely negative beliefs about God are generally associated with more distress. However, prior research on this topic has relied heavily upon self-report Likert-type scales, which are vulnerable to self-report biases and measure only explicit cognitive processes. In this study, we developed and validated an implicit social cognition task, the Positive/Negative God Go/No-go Association Task (PNG-GNAT), for use in psychological research on spirituality and religion (S/R). Preliminary evidence in a large sample (N = 381) suggests that the PNG-GNAT demonstrates internal consistency, test-retest and split-half reliability, and concurrent evidence of validity. Further, our results suggest that PNG-GNAT scores represent different underlying dimensions of S/R than explicit self-report measures, and incrementally predict mental health above and beyond self-report assessment. The PNG-GNAT appears to be an effective tool for measuring implicit positive/negative beliefs about God.	2.1
The development of Ambient Assisted Living systems would be facilitated if there was a development environment that allowed to simulate in a computer the physical environment, its inhabitants, as well as the Ambient Assisted Living system. This requires, on the one hand, an infrastructure for simulating the physical environment and, on the other hand, an infrastructure for emulating the Ambient Assisted Living devices. Both can be interconnected through data streams that allow emulated devices to behave as if they were connected to the real world, since they get similar sensor input. This paper introduces advances on a simulation framework for ambient intelligence so that it becomes capable of producing such data streams.	4.0
Cancer is a serious hazard to human health all around the world; however, many current therapies remain toxic and poor. In view of the understanding of immunology and tumor biology, cancer immunotherapy with minimal toxicity has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer treatment because of immune surveillance. Unfortunately, the efficacy of immunotherapy was impeded and resisted due to the tumor immune evasion mechanism. Hence, targeted cancer immunotherapy has been proposed to tackle the tumor immune suppression and complexity of malignant tumor cells. Nanotechnology-based immunotherapy has improved the limitations and enhanced the therapeutic efficiency of traditional immunotherapy. This review illustrates the recent progresses in immunotherapy based on nanotechnology, and reveals that nanodevices could be utilized for active and passive cancer immunotherapy.	6.3
Traditional allergological diagnostics often provide laboratory data that seem to correspond with similar positive results in different patients. However, with technological developments and the introduction of molecular diagnostics, it is possible to extract and highlight the differences in the serological laboratory data, to obtain detailed specificity on the various allergen components in different clinical settings. Allergological diagnostics prove to be increasingly useful in accurately distinguishing cross-reactivity and cosensitization. This aspect is very important especially in patients who are, with a traditional diagnosis, polysensitized. Molecular diagnosis in allergology has expanded its range of applications thanks to the ability to IgE dose specific (in addition to classic total IgE serum) not only to allergens, food and inhalants, but also to the individual protein components which make up the allergenic source. It is essential to establish a correct diagnosis in order to determine the appropriate therapy. Therefore it is crucial to discern whether a patient is truly allergic because he presents specific IgE for molecules of a species or if the positivity is given from the structural homology between the different proteins. Molecular diagnostics emerges as a valuable tool for the discrimination of allergic patients and to differentiate between true allergies and cross-reactivity. Molecular diagnostics should be used in a targeted manner for an accurate assessment and diagnosis, which would also reduce the use of oral challenges, to predict severe reactions and allergy persistence.	5.1
Smart environments for learning can be considered being a new level of computer enhanced learning, with a number of new interesting facilities. The famous IST Advisory Group (ISTAG) Report started from 2001 a decade of various research initiatives in the rapidly growing area of ambient intelligence. It introduced also a smart environment example in the form of a scenario - Scenario 4: Annette and Solomon in the Ambient for Social Learning. That was a vision of a learning environment, based on a position that learning is a social process. The scenario certainly was a nice incentive for a number of new initiatives focused on more or less successful attempts to design and introduce various types of smart environments capable to support different aspects of learning process. As multi-agent systems are the most frequently used approach towards smart environments design in general, we are convinced that a really systematic approach towards reflecting all desirable functionalities of smart learning environments must be based on a well-designed multi-agent architecture. In the paper we intend firstly to map the recent state of the art in the area of smart environments designed for learning. Further on we wish to list the desirable functionalities of a smart environment for learning, and propose a multi-agent architecture capable of reflecting the functionalities of a smart environment similar to that described in the above mentioned scenario.	4.0
Water pollution is a complex problem as the removal of various pollutants along with microbes need multifunctional materials to make the polluted water potable. Selective removal of highly toxic pollutant such as He ions from wastewaters is an area of critical significance. In this study we report a bi-functional material derived from N-vinylformamide (NVF) that is highly selective and has high adsorption capacity for He ions with qm of 248.76 mg g(-1) and it also acts as an biocidal agent against the representative microorganisms Gram (+), S. epidermidis, Gram (-) S. typhi, bacteria and a fungus C albicans. The effect of different parameters as well as that of the competing ions on He ions adsorption capacity was studied. The material reported in this article represents an important advance over the earlier reported materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.4
Background: Cow's milk, hen's egg and wheat are staple foods in a typical western diet. Despite the ubiquity of these foods, the impact of staple food allergy on health-related quality of life (HRQL) amongst adolescents is incompletely understood. The aims of this study were to make use of the Swedish version of EuroPrevall's disease-specific food allergy quality of life questionnaire-teenager form (FAQLQ-TF) and to investigate the association between objectively-diagnosed staple food allergy and HRQL amongst adolescents. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 58 adolescents aged 13-17 years [n = 40 (69 %) boys] with objectively-diagnosed allergy to the staple foods cow's milk, hen's egg and/or wheat and living in Stockholm, Sweden were included. Adolescents completed the FAQLQ-TF, which has a corresponding scale of 1 = best HRQL, and 7 = worst HRQL. Overall HRQL and domain-specific HRQL were established. Adolescents also reported symptoms, adrenaline auto injector (AAI) prescription and presence of other food allergies. A history of anaphylaxis was defined among those reporting difficulty breathing, inability to stand/collapse, and/or loss of consciousness. Clinically different HRQL was set at a mean difference of >= 0.5. Results: Overall mean HRQL was poorer than average [mean: 4.70/7.00 (95 % CI 4.30-5.01)]. The domain risk of accidental exposure was significantly associated with clinically better HRQL than the domain allergen avoidance and dietary restrictions (mean difference = 0.76; p < 0.001). Girls had clinically worse, but not statistically significantly different mean HRQL than boys (mean difference = 0.71; p < 0.07). HRQL tended to be worse amongst those with allergies to more than three foods or an AAI prescription. The number and types of symptoms, including a history of anaphylaxis were not associated with worse HRQL. Conclusions: As ascertained via a food allergy-specific questionnaire, adolescents with staple food allergy report poorer than average HRQL, specifically in relation to emerging independence and the need for support. Girls have clinically worse HRQL than boys. The number and type of previous symptoms and history of anaphylaxis were not associated with worse HRQL.	5.1
In Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems, the contextual information (time, location, available resources, people behavior, etc.) usually needs to be monitored and analyzed in order to offer pro-active and context-aware functionalities to end users. Therefore, the contextual information should conform to an information model that is commonly devised to capture the specific features of a concrete AmI system. Hence, the incorporation of new functionalities to an AmI system usually involves the modification of the associated information model, which may lead to compatibility and maintainability difficulties. Moreover, the data integration and interoperability at information level between different AmI systems can be limited by the availability of shared concepts in their respective information models. To overcome those problems, this paper presents an information model that can be adapted to the specific data requirements of many different AmI systems, and reused across them. The benefits of the proposal have been validated through the development of a Mobile Forensic Workspace (MFW) for disaster scenarios.	4.0
Aim: To investigate the relationship between inflammatory markers and platelet size in generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). Material and Methods: Periodontal, inflammatory and platelet indices were compared between 59 GAgP patients and 59 healthy subjects. Gingival biopsies from five patients and five healthy subjects were examined by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Changes in patient periodontal and platelet indices were re-evaluated at 3 months after periodontal therapy. Results: Platelet size was decreased significantly in GAgP patients compared to healthy subjects (p <= 0.003). Weak negative correlations between platelet size and periodontal parameters were found in GAgP patients (p <= 0.025). Platelet aggregates and adhesion to the endothelium or leucocytes were found in venules and connective tissues of gingival biopsies from GAgP patients. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet large cell ratio increased after periodontal therapy in GAgP patients (p <= 0.038). The increase in MPV was related to the decrease in bleeding index in GAgP patients after periodontal therapy (p < 0.001; r = 0.357). Conclusion: Platelet size was reduced in GAgP patients compared to healthy controls, possibly due to the consumption of large platelets at sites of periodontal inflammation. Platelets may be involved in host responses to periodontal infection in GAgP.	5.3
This paper quantifies some of the economic benefits that a culture of rainwater harvesting could produce in the case of Bogota. The study makes projections of future water needs until 2035, based on local economy and population growth as determining variables of water service needs. It also discusses the appropriateness of promoting water harvesting as a strategy to manage the urgent situation caused by the limitations that climate change would provoke on the water supply of the city. Projected water supply needs for the growing population evidence the need of an increase of 37.6% in the supply capacity of drinking water for the localities that make up the urban area of Bogota. The article concludes that rainwater harvesting would generate significant savings in water and water supply costs for users and for the State.	4.3
Indoor scene classification is usually approached from a computer vision perspective. However, in some fields like robotics, additional constraints must be taken into account. Specifically, in systems with low resources, state-of-the-art techniques (CNNs) cannot be successfully deployed. In this paper, we try to close this gap between theoretical approaches and real world solutions by performing an in-depth study of the factors that influence classifiers performance, that is, size and descriptor quality. To this end, we perform a thorough evaluation of the visual and depth data obtained with an RGB-D sensor to propose techniques to build robust descriptors that can enable real-time indoor scene classification. Those descriptors are obtained by properly selecting and combining visual and depth information sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	0.0
Brain imaging plays an important role in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where atrophy has been found to occur in the hippocampal formation during the very early disease stages and to progress in parallel with the disease's evolution. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible correlation between Small World characteristics of the brain connectivity architecture-as extracted from EEG recordings-and hippocampal volume in AD patients. A dataset of 144 subjects, including 110 AD (MMSE 21.3) and 34 healthy Nold (MMSE 29.8) individuals, was evaluated. Weighted and undirected networks were built by the eLORETA solutions of the cortical sources' activities moving from EEG recordings. The evaluation of the hippocampal volume was carried out on a subgroup of 60 AD patients who received a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence and underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer image analysis software. Results showed that, quantitatively, more correlation was observed in the right hemisphere, but the same trend was seen in both hemispheres. Alpha band connectivity was negatively correlated, while slow (delta) and fast-frequency (beta, gamma) bands positively correlated with hippocampal volume. Namely, the larger the hippocampal volume, the lower the alpha and the higher the delta, beta, and gamma Small World characteristics of connectivity. Accordingly, the Small World connectivity pattern could represent a functional counterpart of structural hippocampal atrophying and related-network disconnection.	5.2
This paper presents the stability analysis of dc distributed power systems with multiple converter-controlled loads. The load converters are tightly controlled, behaving as constant power loads with low-damped LC filters. The dynamic behavior of the system in high frequency range is often not studied with the classical tools based on conventional averaging techniques. However, dc power systems with the reduced size filter, and consequently, the high resonant frequency, are widely used in transportation applications. In this paper, the stability analysis of the system is established based on a discrete-time model of the system, taking into account the switching frequency and intrinsic nonlinearities of the system model. The impacts of the filter parameters and interactions among the constant power loads are investigated with the proposed discrete-time method. Moreover, an active stabilizer is developed and included in the dynamic model of the system, in order to extend the stability margin. The theoretical observations are then validated experimentally on a laboratory hardware prototype.	1.4
The effectiveness of the single layer of the geocell reinforced soil has been investigated in geotechnical applications by researchers. But the limited height of commercially produced geocell and a major obstacle to achieve a uniform and suitable density inside the cells, leads to investigate the performance of multi-layered geocell reinforced soil in improving the behaviour of soil. In the paper a series of triaxial compression tests was carried out on natural soil with and without geocell layers. The layers configuration is two and four horizontal geocell reinforcing layers in a triaxial test sample. The influences of the number of geocell layers and confining pressure were studied and described. Based on test results, it is observed that the strength of soil is improved significantly with geocell layers. Also, the results indicate that, for the same mass of geocell material used in the reinforced soil samples, four layers of geocell reinforcement behaves more effectively than those obtained for two layers of geocell reinforcement to improve the stress-strain behavior. The apparent cohesive strength induced by geocell reinforcement increases significantly with increase in the geocell layers from two to four whereas the friction angle of soil samples does not affect by the geocell reinforcement. The use of the improvement in strength response due to inclusion of layers of geocell can be advantageously used in bearing capacity improvement and settlement reduction in the design of shallow foundations and pavement system.	4.1
The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) and intracellular Ca2+ signaling are critically involved in regulating different steps of autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway. The ryanodine receptors (RyR), intracellular Ca2+-release channels mainly expressed in excitable cell types including muscle and neurons, have however not yet been extensively studied in relation to autophagy. Yet, aberrant expression and excessive activity of RyRs in these tissues has been implicated in the onset of several diseases including Alzheimer's disease, where impaired autophagy regulation contributes to the pathology. In this study, we determined whether pharmacological RyR inhibition could modulate autophagic flux in ectopic RyR-expressing models, like HEK293 cells and in cell types that endogenously express RyRs, like C2C12 myoblasts and primary hippocampal neurons. Importantly, RyR3 overexpression in HEK293 cells impaired the autophagic flux. Conversely, in all cell models tested, pharmacological inhibition of endogenous or ectopically expressed RyRs, using dantrolene or ryanodine, augmented autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal turn -over (number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes measured as mCherry-LC3 punctaeicell increased from 70.37 +/- 7.81 in control HEK RyR3 cells to 111.18 +/- 7.72 and 98.14 +/- 7.31 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). Moreover, in differentiated C2C12 cells, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that dantrolene treatment decreased the number of early autophagic vacuoles from 5.9 +/- 2.97 to 1.8 +/- 1.03 per cellular cross section. The modulation of the autophagic flux could be linked to the functional inhibition of RyR channels as both RyR inhibitors efficiently diminished the number of cells showing spontaneous RyR3 activity in the HEK293 cell model (from 41.14% +/- 2.12 in control cells to 18.70% +/- 2.25 and 9.74% +/- 2.67 after dantrolene and ryanodine treatments, respectively). In conclusion, basal RyR-mediated Ca2+-release events suppress autophagic flux at the level of the lysosomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
New combination of an electrical machine and a two-step planetary gear for high torque traction applications is introduced. This kind of a machine can act as a propulsion motor for working machines such as e. q. agricultural tractor that needs to generate very high traction forces and also higher travelling speeds. The technology also suits in some road vehicle use e. g. for buses or trucks. Detailed information about the electrical machine design is provided. The machine has tooth-coils in the stator, embedded permanent magnets in the rotor and its cooling is arranged via the gear lubrication as the chamber is semi-filled with oil.	3.3
Available cholinergic drugs for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) provide modest symptomatic benefit. We hypothesized that co-administration of a peripheral anticholinergic to reduce dose-limiting adverse effects (AEs) would enable the safe/tolerable use of higher cholinesterase inhibitor doses and thus improve their antidementia efficacy. A modified single-blind, ascending-dose, phase IIa study of donepezil plus solifenacin (CPC-201) lasting 26 weeks was conducted in 41 patients with probable AD of moderate severity. Entry criteria included the use of donepezil at a dose of 10 mg/day during the preceding 3 months. The primary outcome measure was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of donepezil achieved (to protocol limit of 40 mg/day) when administered with the anticholinergic solifenacin 15 mg/day. Secondary measures included assessments of cognitive and global function, as well as of AEs. The mean +/- SD donepezil MTD increased to 38 +/- 0.74 mg/day (median 40 mg/day; p < 0.001); 88% of the study population safely attained this dose at the end of titration. Markedly reduced donepezil AE frequency, especially gastrointestinal, allowed this dose increase. There were no drug-related serious AEs or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. At 26 weeks, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Component scores in the efficacy evaluable population improved by 0.35 +/- 0.85 points over baseline (p < 0.05), an estimated 2.5 +/- 0.84 points above 10 mg/day donepezil and 5.4 +/- 0.84 points above historic placebo (both p < 0.05). Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scores improved by 0.94 +/- 0.20 to 3.1 +/- 0.20 points (p < 0.001). The findings suggest that limiting donepezil AEs by co-administration of solifenacin allows the safe administration of substantially higher cholinesterase inhibitors doses that may augment cognitive and global benefits in patients with AD.	5.2

In the present study, the inhibitory properties of N-[2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]-2-[(2-hydroxy-4,5-dimethoxybenzoyl)amino]-1,3-thiazole-4-carboxamide monohydrochloride trihydrate (Z-338), a novel gastroprokinetic agent, were investigated and compared with those of cisapride to establish its potential for drug-drug interactions. There was no notable inhibition of terfenadine metabolism or of any of the isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1/2, 2A6, 2136, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) by Z-338 in in vitro studies using human liver microsomes. Z-338 was mainly metabolized to its glucuronide by UGT1A9 (UDP glucoronosyltransferase I family, polypeptide A9) and UGT1A8, and did not show marked inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity. On the other hand, cisapride strongly inhibited CYP3A4 and markedly inhibited CYP2C9. Furthermore, we used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to investigate the effects of Z-338 and cisapride on potassium currents in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). Z-338 had no significant effect on hERG-related current at the relatively high concentration of 10 muM In contrast, the inhibition by Z-338 was very small compared with that of cisapride at 10 nM, which was a thousand-fold lower concentration. In the prediction method for the drug interaction between terfenadine and cisapride based on the K-i and PK parameters, we suggest the possibility that terfenadine mainly affect the QT interval, since its plasma concentration would be markedly increased, but cisapride may not be changed. Thus, in contrast with cisapride, Z-338 did not inhibit CYP and the hERG channel, and is predominantly metabolized by glucuronide conjugation, Z-338 is considered unlikely to cause significant drug-drug interactions when coadministered with CYP substrates at clinically effective doses.

The recent makeshift in fuel choice, renewable energy sources has been considered as the most popular form of its kind because of its environment friendly approaches, less cost tariff policy and the natural fuel abundance. This inclusion in power system promotes Micro-grid system to optimize the overall distribution. FPGA, elaborated as Field Programmable Gate Array, proposes chances for enhanced performance and coveted flexibility in design for the digital control. Conversely, the erudite convolution of the Hardware Description Language (HDL) coding, a way translating to HDL, can be an undesirable hurdle for the professional system designers. The design, depicted in this letter, is an instance of system modeling for FPGA-based digital control, which necessarily has the desired ability to auto-generate the HDL codes. The architecture of this design uses the DSP Builder technology, in a MATLAB / SIMULINK platform. A three phase full-bridge gird tied inverter for wind system and a three phase full-bridge inverter for grid connected wind system are built that demonstrates the close correlation with the model. The necessary simulations, results and the experimental analysis have also been highlighted for the different control techniques such as PI, dq, and the PWM control technique.	1.4
Understanding intent and relevance of surrounding agents from video is an essential task for many applications in robotics and computer vision. The modeling and evaluation of contextual, spatio-temporal situation awareness is particularly important in the domain of intelligent vehicles, where a robot is required to smoothly navigate in a complex environment while also interacting with humans. In this paper, we address these issues by studying the task of on-road object importance ranking from video. First, human-centric object importance annotations are employed in order to analyze the relevance of a variety of multi-modal cues for the importance prediction task. A deep convolutional neural network model is used for capturing video-based contextual spatial and temporal cues of scene type, driving task, and object properties related to intent. Second, the proposed importance annotations are used for producing novel analysis of error types in image-based object detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate how cost-sensitive training, informed by the object importance annotations, results in improved detection performance on objects of higher importance. This insight is essential for an application where navigation mistakes are safety-critical, and the quality of automation and human robot interaction is key.	0.0
The objective of this study was to assess the immune and stress responsiveness of cows identified as extremely high and low feed conversion efficiency phenotypes. The study utilised 16 Holstein-Friesian cows in their third to fourth lactation, and identified as having either extremely high (n = 8) or extremely low (n = 8) feed conversion efficiency. A commercial vaccine was used to induce measurable antibody-and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses and assess general immune responsiveness. Stress responsiveness was assessed by measuring changes in plasma cortisol concentrations in response to yarding and handling. No significant differences in antibody-or cell-mediated immune responsiveness were observed between the extreme high and low feed conversion efficiency phenotypes (P = 0.343 and 0.546, respectively). However, results suggested that plasma cortisol concentrations trended higher in the low feed conversion efficiency phenotype cows than their high feed conversion efficiency counterparts (P = 0.079) 48 h post-yarding and handling. A significant negative correlation was observed between antibody-mediated immune responsiveness and stress responsiveness (r = -0.44, P = 0.043) but not with cell-mediated immune responsiveness (r = 0.135, P = 0.309). This study provides preliminary evidence that cows selected for feed conversion efficiency may have improved stress-coping abilities and immune responsiveness.	6.3
Objective: Thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity is a common complication in the late stage of ankylosing spondylitis. The aim of this study was to compare the correction efficacy for ankylosing spondylitis kyphosis using preoperative osteotomy designs of papercut (PC)/splice and Photoshop (PS). Methods: This was a retrospective study of 35 patients with ankylosing spondylitis and thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity that underwent correction osteotomy at the Department of Spinal Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Yan'an University between May 2009 and November 2014. The preoperative osteotomy design using PC/splice was applied in 17 patients and preoperative osteotomy design using PS was applied in 18 patients. The patients were followed-up for 18-30 months. The postoperative osteotomy angle error and correction efficacy at the last follow-up were compared between the two groups. Results: There were significant differences in the errors between postoperative actual and preoperative planned osteotomy angle of the PS group and PC/splice group (P < 0.01). The spinal sagittal global kyphosis and sagittal vertical axis in the PS group were 29.3 +/- 11.1 degrees and 3.1 +/- 1.6 cm, respectively, while those in the PC/splice group were 38.9 +/- 13.1 degrees and 5.7 +/- 2.1 cm, respectively (P < 0.01). The Oswestry Disability index and Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)-22 questionnaire score in the PS group were significantly higher to those in the PC/splice group (P<0.05). PS was independently associated with improvements in SRS-22 scores (OR=63.0; 95% CI: 1.73-2298.19; P=0.02). Conclusion: Compared with osteotomy design using traditional PC/splice, osteotomy design using the PS software could achieve a smaller osteotomy angle error and a better postoperative spinal balance in the sagittal plane.	5.3
In this issue of Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, K. Jensen et al. (Clin Vaccine Immunol 24: e00360-16, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/CVI.00360-16) describe a dual-purpose attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis-simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine (AMTB-SIV). Interestingly, immunized infant macaques required fewer oral exposures to SIV to become infected relative to nonimmunized animals. The authors hypothesized that augmented susceptibility to SIV was due to activation of CD4(+) T cells through trained immunity. This commentary explores the possible relationship between trained immunity, enhanced CD4 T cell responses, and increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).	6.3
Chalcogenide glasses of 65GeS(2)-(25-x)Ga2S3-10AgI-xLa(2)S(3) (x=0, 1, 3, and 5 mol%) were fabricated through the traditional melt-quenching method. The effects of addition of La2S3 on physical, thermal and optical properties of the glass system were investigated. The results showed that the fabricated glasses possess considerably high glass transition temperature, exhibit improved mechanical property and excellent infrared transmission. A redshift at the visible absorbing cut-off edge is observed with increasing of La2S3 content. The direct and indirect optical band gap values are also calculated. Raman spectra analysis indicated that the band at 265 cm(-1) decreased in amplitude and a new peak at 230 cm(-1) was detected manifesting the formation of La-S bond in the network. In addition, the mid-infrared emission at 3.74 mu m of the glasses doped with Tm3+ ions was achieved. The results indicated that the glasses are promising materials for mid-infrared applications such as imaging, remote sensing and lasers.	4.2
The current study presents a methodology to analyze first impressions on the basis of minimal motion information. In order to test the applicability of the approach brief silent video clips of 40 speakers were presented to independent observers (i.e., did not know speakers) who rated them on measures of the Big Five personality traits. The body movements of the speakers were then captured by placing landmarks on the speakers' forehead, one shoulder and the hands. Analysis revealed that observers ascribe extraversion to variations in the speakers' overall activity, emotional stability to the movements' relative velocity, and variation in motion direction to openness. Although ratings of openness and conscientiousness were related to biographical data of the speakers (i.e., measures of career progress), measures of body motion failed to provide similar results. In conclusion, analysis of motion behavior might be done on the basis of a small set of landmarks that seem to capture important parts of relevant nonverbal information. (C) 2013 The Author.

This paper explores the design of an ultra light-weight power and torque dense motor to enhance the performance of a light-weight electric racing vehicle. Such a racing vehicle is to compete in formula student racing events. The state-of-the-art powertrain in these vehicles are axial-field machines or medium speed radial-field machines with a gear. This paper concerns a high speed traction machine radial-field design that closely considers the endurance duty-cycle and/or driving cycle of a race car and provides fast acceleration. The proposed electrical machine is designed to be ultra-light-weight. Therefore, an 18,000 rpm (single gear), 24 slot, 4 pole and 33 Nm brushless highly saturated permanent magnet machine is designed, with an active mass of around 3.0 kg (similar to 10kW/kg and 10 Nm/kg). To account for the various race events, the velocity of the racing tracks is to be closely matched with the machine output characteristics. Within this paper, the design and no-load results will be presented. In the near future (Q2 of 2015), following extended tests, this machine (integrated with a specifically designed single-stage gear) will be used to drive the vehicle using torque vectoring on all four-wheels. We expect that this will result in a significant performance gain in acceleration, endurance and handling characteristics of the 2015 University Racing Eindhoven race vehicle.	3.3
A new application of geosynthetic tube for offshore dike construction is geosynthetic mattress in which its horizontal dimension is much greater than the vertical one. This makes it more stable than the sausage shaped geosynthetic tube. However, the existing analytical or numerical methods developed for the sausage shaped geosynthetic tube may not be applicable directly to geosynthetic mattresses as the solution may not converge. In this paper, a closed-form solution was derived for a direct determination of the cross-section of geosynthetic mattress. Laboratory large scale model tests were also carried out to verify the proposed analytical method. The cross-sections of the geosynthetic mattresses obtained from the closed-form solutions agreed well with the data obtained from model tests. The tensile forces measured from the model tests were rather scattered but showed a consistent thread as those from the closed-form solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1

First, it aims to analyze the teaching and learning processes applied to degrees that enable regulated professional activities for both Technical Industrial Engineering and Industrial Engineering. More precisely, it examines the competences related to Manufacturing Engineering, either at the Bachelor's or Master's Level. Second, it intends to establish a simple and easy process to evaluate the competences acquired in a certain Bachelor's or Master's degree. As a result, it will be possible to identify current weaknesses in the study plans. This could be the universities' starting point in the definition of procedures and areas for improvement that allow for a better match among study plans, the acquisition of competences, and the learning results finally achieved.

This paper presents a mixed reality (MR) system that results from the integration of a telepresence system and an application to improve collaborative space exploration. The system combines free viewpoint video with immersive projection technology to support nonverbal communication (NVC), including eye gaze, interpersonal distance, and facial expression. Importantly, these features can be interpreted together as people move around the simulation, maintaining a natural social distance. The application is a simulation of Mars, within which the collaborators must come to agreement over; for example, where the Rover should land and go. The first contribution is the creation of an MR system supporting contextualization of NVC. Two technological contributions are prototyping a technique to subtract a person from a background that may contain physical objects and/or moving images and a lightweight texturing method for multiview rendering, which provides balance in terms of visual and temporal quality. A practical contribution is the demonstration of pragmatic approaches to sharing space between display systems of distinct levels of immersion. A research tool contribution is a system that allows comparison of conventional authored and video-based reconstructed avatars, within an environment that encourages exploration and social interaction. Aspects of system quality, including the communication of facial expression and end-to-end latency are reported.	2.3
Coral reefs in the Xisha Islands (also known as the Paracel Islands in English), South China Sea, have experienced dramatic declines in coral cover. However, the current regional scale hard coral distribution of geomorphic and ecological zones, essential for reefs management in the context of global warming and ocean acidification, is not well documented. We analyzed data from field surveys, Landsat-8 and GF-1 images to map the distribution of hard coral within geomorphic zones and reef flat ecological zones. In situ surveys conducted in June 2014 on nine reefs provided a complete picture of reef status with regard to live coral diversity, evenness of coral cover and reef health (live versus dead cover) for the Xisha Islands. Mean coral cover was 12.5% in 2014 and damaged reefs seemed to show signs of recovery. Coral cover in sheltered habitats such as lagoon patch reefs and biotic dense zones of reef flats was higher, but there were large regional differences and low diversity. In contrast, the more exposed reef slopes had high coral diversity, along with high and more equal distributions of coral cover. Mean hard coral cover of other zones was < 10%. The total Xisha reef system was estimated to cover 1 060 km(2), and the emergent reefs covered similar to 787 m(2). Hard corals of emergent reefs were considered to cover 97 km(2). The biotic dense zone of the reef flat was a very common zone on all simple atolls, especially the broader northern reef flats. The total cover of live and dead coral can reach above 70% in this zone, showing an equilibrium between live and dead coral as opposed to coral and algae. This information regarding the spatial distribution of hard coral can support and inform the management of Xisha reef ecosystems.	4.2
Dielectric actuators are utilized to convert electrical power into mechanical strain with considerable potential in microrobotic applications. However, critical challenges that need to be addressed include high-voltage interface with high conversion ratio, light weight, small size, and high power density. This study proposes a high piezoelectric transformer-based high conversion ratio interface that is integrated with a direct current/direct current high conversion ratio boost stage and a direct current/alternating current high-voltage driving stage. A piezoelectric transformer-based class-E zero voltage switching direct current/direct current interface is controlled by a hybrid pulse frequency modulation and pulse width modulation control strategies to obtain the desired high step-up ratio in the direct current/direct current stage. A half-bridge converter with special digital control algorithm in the direct current/alternating current stage is designed to convert high direct current voltage into arbitrary unipolar signal driving dielectric actuators. A prototype 23.3 g and 4W interface has been fabricated for experimental validation to verify its ability to drive a 1 kV input dielectric actuator at 5 Hz in microrobotic applications.	1.4
Mast cells (MCs) are present in connective tissue and at mucosal surfaces in all classes of vertebrates. In health, they contribute to tissue homeostasis, host defense, and tissue repair via multiple receptors regulating the release of a vast stockpile of proinflammatory mediators, proteases, and cytokines. However, these potentially protective cells are a double-edged sword. When there is a repeated or long-term stimulus, MC activation leads to tissue damage and dysfunction. Accordingly, MCs are implicated in the pathophysiologic aspects of numerous diseases covering all organs. Understanding the biology of MCs, their heterogeneity, mechanisms of activation, and signaling cascades may lead to the development of novel therapies for many diseases for which current treatments are lacking or are of poor efficacy. This review will focus on updates and developments in MC biology and their clinical implications, with a particular focus on their role in respiratory diseases.	6.1
In this paper, we propose novel techniques to reduce total cost and peak load of factories from a customer point of view. We control energy storage system (ESS) to minimize the total electricity bill under the Korea commercial and industrial (KCI) tariff, which both considers peak load and time of use (ToU). Under the KCI tariff, the average peak load, which is the maximum among all average power consumptions measured every 15 min for the past 12 months, determines the monthly base cost, and thus peak load control is extremely critical. We aim to leverage ESS for both peak load reduction based on load prediction as well as energy arbitrage exploiting ToU. However, load prediction inevitably has uncertainty, which makes ESS operation challenging with KCI tariff. To tackle it, we apply robust optimization to minimize risk in a real environment. Our approach significantly reduces the peak load by 49.9% and the total cost by 10.8% compared to the case that does not consider load uncertainty. In doing this we also consider battery degradation cost and validate the practical use of the proposed techniques.	1.0
The boiling water reactors (BWRs) are inherently nonlinear physical system, as any other physical system. The reactivity feedback, which is caused by both moderator density and temperature, allows several effects reflecting the nonlinear behavior of the system. Stability analyses of BWR is done with a simplified, reduced order model, which couples point reactor kinetics with thermal hydraulics of the reactor core. The linear stability analysis of the BWR for steady states shows that at a critical value of bifurcation parameter (i.e. feedback gain), Hopf bifurcation occurs. These stable and unstable domains of parametric spaces cannot be predicted by linear stability analysis because the stability of system does not include only stability of the steady states. The stability of other dynamics of the system such as limit cycles must be included in study of stability. The nonlinear stability analysis (i.e. bifurcation analysis) becomes an indispensable component of stability analysis in this scenario. Hopf bifurcation, which occur with one free parameter, is studied here and it formulates birth of limit cycles. The excitation of these limit cycles makes the system bistable in the case of subcritical bifurcation whereas stable limit cycles continues in an unstable region for supercritical bifurcation. The distinction between subcritical and supercritical Hopf is done by two parameter analysis (i.e. codimension-2 bifurcation). In this scenario, Generalized Hopf bifurcation (GH) takes place, which separates sub and supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The various types of bifurcation such as limit point bifurcation of limit cycle (LPC), period doubling bifurcation of limit cycles (PD) and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of limit cycles (NS) have been identified with the Floquet multipliers. The LPC manifests itself as the region of bistability whereas chaotic region exist because of cascading of PD. This region of bistability and chaotic solutions are drawn on the various parametric bifurcation diagrams (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.1
Background: Mobility changes are concerning for elderly patients with cognitive decline. Given frail older individuals' vulnerability to injury, it is critical to identify contributors to limited mobility. Objective: To examine whether structural brain abnormalities, including reduced gray matter volume and white matter hyperintensities, would be associated with limited mobility among individuals with cognitive impairment, and to determine whether cognitive impairment would mediate this relationship. Methods: Thirty-four elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease underwent neuropsychological evaluation, mobility assessment, and structural brain neuroimaging. Linear regression was conducted with predictors including gray matter volume in six regions of interest (ROI) and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, with mobility measures as outcomes. Results: Lower gray matter volume in caudate nucleus was associated with slower speed on a functional mobility task. Higher cerebellar volume was also associated with slower functional mobility. White matter hyperintensity burden was not significantly associated with mobility. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence for associations between subcortical gray matter volume and speed on a functional mobility task among cognitively impaired individuals.	5.2
Landfill leachate makes a potential source of ground water pollution. Municipal waste landfill substratum can be used for removal of pollutants from leachate. Model research was performed with use of a sand bed and artificially prepared leachates. Effectiveness of filtration in a bed of specific thickness was assessed based on the total solids content. Result of the model research indicated that the mass of pollutants contained in leachate filtered by a layer of porous soil (m(f)) depends on the mass of pollutants supplied (m(d)). Determined regression functions indicate agreement with empirical values of variable m'(f). The determined regression functions allow for qualitative and quantitative assessment of influence of the analysed independent variables (m'(d), l, omega) on values of mass of pollutants flowing from the medium sand layer. Results of this research can be used to forecast the level of pollution of soil and underground waters lying in the zone of potential impact of municipal waste landfill.	4.4
A series of zinc-phosphate glass containing different concentrations of V2O5 ((80 - x) NaPO3 + 20 ZnO + x V2O5 (x = 0-25 mol%)) was prepared by melt quenching method and analyzed by differential scanning caloremetry (DSC) and impredance spectroscopy. The electrical properties of these samples were measured using ac impedance spectroscopy technique over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 13 MHz at several temperatures in the range of 323-673 K. The ac conductivity, dc conductivity, dielectric constant and loss factors were obtained from these measurements. Constant-phase elements (CPE) are used in equivalent electrical circuits for the fitting of experimental impedance data. The impedance spectra have also indicated that the conduction is predominantly polaronic in nature. The frequency and temperature dependence of the electrical modulis as well as dielectric loss parameters have exhibited a relaxation character attributed to the vanadyl complexes. The relaxation effects have been analyzed by the graphical method. From this analysis, it has been established that there is a spread of relaxation times. The results have been further discussed quantitatively in the light of different valance states of vanadium ions with the aid of the data on spectroscopic properties. The frequency dependence of the electric conductivity was found to follow a simple power law behavior, in accordance with the relation sigma(ac)(omega) = sigma(0) + Lambda(1).omega(s)(2), where s(1) and s(2) are smaller than 1. The thermal activation energies for the electronic conduction were estimated on the basis of the Arrhenius plots. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.	1.2
The full potential of plastic gear usage is limited by not only poor mechanical properties but also equally poor temperature limits and poor heat conduction properties. Cooling holes were developed to decrease the amount of thermal damage on the contact surface. These cooling holes promote increased stress and tooth deflection, thus exerting a negative effect. This article compares various cooling holes for plastic gear configurations and proposes novel cooling holes. Thermal and mechanical simulations that consider specific aspects of plastic gear meshing were performed. The main objective of this article was to verify the best methods for reducing thermal damage through cooling holes. The results indicate the best compromise between the temperature reduction and the mechanical properties of the new tooth geometry. The results also indicate that the simple variations in the cooling holes proposed can improve tooth performance.	3.3
We investigated how interrater agreement in personality judgment is affected by the perceivers' affection or dislike regarding the targets. A total of 209 perceivers judged the personalities of 15 targets by means of 30 adjectives. The targets were public figures (e.g., the Pope), which enabled gathering a large number of ratings by perceivers differing in liking. Shared liking was associated with strong increases, and large liking differences were associated with strong decreases, in profile correlations. Shared antipathy was also associated with lower agreement. The greater agreement between judgments of liked targets was largely due to the perceivers characterizing targets positively, whereas judgments of disliked targets were not affected by (shared) negativity to the same extent. The perceivers' attitudes toward the targets constitute an important factor in person perception and need to be taken into account more systematically in research studies.	2.2
This paper focuses on the security assessment of electricity distribution networks (DNs) with vulnerable distributed energy resource (DER) nodes. The adversary model is a simultaneous compromise of DER nodes by strategic manipulation of generation setpoints. The loss to the defender (DN operator) includes loss of voltage regulation and cost of induced load control under supply-demand mismatch caused by the attack. A three-stage defender-attacker-defender (DAD) game is formulated: in Stage 1, the defender chooses a security strategy to secure a subset of DER nodes; in Stage 2, the attacker compromises a set of vulnerable DERs and injects false generation setpoints; in Stage 3, the defender responds by controlling loads and non-compromised DERs. Solving this trilevel optimization problem is hard due to nonlinear power flows and mixed-integer decision variables. To address this challenge, the problem is approximated by a tractable formulation based on an epsilon-linear power-flow model. The set of critical DER nodes and the setpoint manipulations characterizing the optimal attack strategy are computed. An iterative greedy approach to computing attacker-defender strategies for the original nonlinear problem is proposed. These results provide guidelines for optimal security investment and defender response in preattack and postattack conditions, respectively.	0.2
Bidirectional associations between sibling relationships and children's problem behaviors are robust, and links with prosocial behavior have also been reported. Using cross-lagged models, we were able to conservatively test temporal directions of links between positive and negative aspects of sibling relationships and children's prosocial behavior and conduct problems across a 3-year time span in middle childhood. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/) is an ongoing population-based study designed to investigate the effects of a wide range of factors on children's health and development. For the purposes of the current analyses, we included 2,043 ALSPAC families who had just 1 older sibling as well as the target child, with an age gap of no more than 5 years. Mothers reported about the quality of the sibling relationship and both children's prosocial behavior and conduct problems when the target child was 4 years of age and again when the target child was 7 years old. Confirming our hypothesis, individual child behavior was predictive of sibling relationship quality, and sibling relationship quality was predictive of later child behavior, providing robust evidence of bidirectionality for both prosocial behavior and conduct problems. It would be consistent to expect that an improvement in either sibling relationship quality or individual children's behavior could have a positive spill over effect. We also found evidence of older sibling dominance in the domain of prosocial behavior and the positive aspects of sibling interaction.	2.4
A long-term Northern Hemisphere (NH) daily 5-km snow cover extent (SCE) product (JASMES) was developed by the application of a consistent objective snow cover mapping algorithm to data from historical optical sensors on polar orbiting satellites from 1978 to 2015. A conventional decision tree algorithm with multiple threshold tests was employed to analyze radiances for the five spectral bands available across the full analysis period. The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer's accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

The need to find a better products and more efficient technique to help in removing toxic pathogens from water and help in the reduction of water pollution in the fastest, effective way and with low cost could help the worlds pollution problem. In the past, chemicals have been used for water purification and cleaning and it's still very much in use, chemical such as chlorine, ozone etc. are been used. However, research has shown that these chemical products are often given reactions with various components in natural water indicating that more than 500 different types of disinfectant byproducts obtained maybe known to be carcinogenic. Meanwhile using antibiotics as conventional method has become less effective because of the resistant strains of the antibiotics therefore the quest to design a more robust bio detection strategy is necessary. The Identification of co-precipitation method as the best method considered, this was employed in the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles using one-step reaction process. Functional group probing of the synthesized magnetic nanoparticle, as well as morphological analysis and particle size determination, were achieved by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Zeta-Sizer, respectively. If properly coated with the right and stable polymer, the use of magnetic chitosan nanoparticle can become widely known and helpful for pathogen detection with the aim of resolving the world pollution problem.	4.4
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) exert critical roles in type 2 immune responses, epithelial repair at mucosal tissues and metabolic homeostasis. ILC2 rapidly provide large amounts of type 2 signature cytokines, thereby driving type 2 immune responses such as the defense against helminths. However, if deregulated, ILC2 facilitate tissue fibrosis and trigger unwanted type 2 immunopathologies such as allergies, asthma and atopic dermatitis. Therefore, ILC2 need to be tightly regulated and we are just beginning to understand which mediators activate or inhibit this rare but important cell population. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about positive and negative regulation of ILC2 and discuss its immunological consequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.1
Industrial deployment of the Internet Of Things (IOT) provides development of an ideal platform for decentralized management of warehouses. In this paper, we propose an IOT infrastructure for collaborative warehouse order fulfillment based on RFID, ambient intelligence and multi-agent system. It consists of a physical devices layer, a middleware ambient platform, a multi-agent system and an enterprise resource planning. It integrates a bottom-up approach with decision support mechanisms such as self-organization and negotiation protocols between agents based on com-peration=competition+cooperation concept. This approach was selected to improve reaction capabilities of decentralized management of warehouses in a dynamic environment. A collaborative warehouse example was conducted to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed infrastructure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.0
Intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) appears to have positive social consequences, but these effects are often highly context- and person-specific. The present research examined whether the core personality trait of extraversion may be one important person-specific factor that plays a role in these associations. Across two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled studies (total ns: Study 1 = 121; Study 2 = 112), we observed significant interactions between OT administration and extraversion predicting prosocial outcomes. For individuals low in extraversion, OT administration relative to placebo led to greater perceived social connection and prosocial tendencies (Study 1) and more positive behavioral responses to help and greater trust of an interaction partner (Study 2). In contrast, OT administration was not beneficial for individuals high in extraversion. Overall, these findings contribute to growing evidence that OT administration has complex, person-specific effects on social behavior, indicating that extraversion plays an important role in these associations.	2.4
Communication training has become a focus of concern in recent years in veterinary medicine. Existing literature to date indicates that Colleges of Veterinary Medicine (CVMs) have implemented various communication training protocols. The present study focused on the evaluation of a communication training protocol implemented in 2007 at Kansas State University (KSU) in a sample of veterinary medical students (N=415) across five cohorts. The protocol includes video review of authentic client interactions, feedback from authentic clients, and small-group communication training. Findings indicate that targeted communication skills improved through video-review feedback and small-group communication training. Communication scores were particularly affected by students' attention to improving communication deficiencies during a second student-client video. Baseline scores from the first student-client video in four specific areas (using nonverbal communication, setting expectations, building rapport, and being able to clarify) were predictive of overall performance during the second evaluation. Based on the results of the present study, using videos of authentic client interactions is recommended as a valuable communication training teaching tool.	2.3
This paper presents the results of a long-term, continuous hydrologic simulation analysis of a watershed-scale residential rainwater harvesting (RWH) program in the Chollas Creek watershed, San Diego, California, USA. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) simulated rainfall-runoff responses for variations in a RWH network, including the RWH unit storage size, the number of implementing households, the amount of time before a unit is allowed to release captured runoff (i.e. drain delay), and the time it takes for the unit to drain (i.e. coefficient of discharge). Comparison of results found reductions to increase linearly with capacity and implementation. Maximum long-term watershed volumetric reductions between 10.1% and 12.4% were observed for the period of analysis (1948-2011) with a range of RWH storage sizes (227 L barrels to 7571 L cisterns). The ratio of overflow to underdrain flow, ranging from 5.17 to 0.014(227-7571 L), exhibits the ability of cisterns to fully capture the majority of annual and long-term events. Sensitivity analysis found regional precipitation characteristics and disconnection of rooftop runoff to impact long-term watershed reduction potential more so than available RWH capacity. Drain delay control and dry duration time increased reduction variability with cisterns, though long-term reductions were not significantly impacted. Normalization of net present value (NPV) to volumetric reductions yielded a RWH unit cost of $0.20-$1.71 per 1000 L of watershed runoff reduced on average per year. Minor variations in cost based on the extent of watershed implementation highlights the potential to incrementally institute RWH programs. For the case study location, the 227-L rain barrel provided the greatest cost-effectiveness, reducing an average 6500 L of runoff per dollar invested for the analysis period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to determine the effect of the SNAPPS (summarize, narrow, analyze, probe, plan, and select) method versus teacher-centered education on the clinical skills of midwifery students in Iran. In this clinical trial, 36 midwifery students in their 4th year of education in 2015 were enrolled and divided into 6 groups, 3 groups for teacher-centered education and 3 groups for the SNAPPS method, with each group spending 10 days in the outpatient gynecology clinic. A questionnaire and a checklist were used to gather data. An independent t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the data. Ability to gain the trust of the patient, verbal and nonverbal communication skills, history taking, preparation of the patient for gynecological examination, and diagnosis and treatment of common diseases were significantly better in the SNAPPS group compared to the teacher-centered education group (P<0.05). The SNAPPS education method can significantly improve the clinical skills of midwifery students in gynecology, in particular history taking, differential diagnosis, and treatment of common diseases.	2.3
Virtual power plant (VPP) concept was developed to integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid in order that they are seen as a single power plant by the market and power system operator. Therefore, VPPs are faced with optimal bidding, and identifying arbitrage opportunities in a market environment. In this study, the authors present an arbitrage strategy for VPPs by participating in energy and ancillary service (i.e. spinning reserve and reactive power services) markets. On the basis of a security-constrained price-based unit commitment, their proposed model maximises VPP's profit (revenue minus costs) considering arbitrage opportunities. The supply-demand balancing, transmission network topology and security constraints are considered to ensure reliable operation of VPP. The mathematical model is a mixed-integer non-linear optimisation problem with inter-temporal constraints, and solved by mixed-integer non-linear programming. The result is a single optimal bidding profile and a schedule for managing active and reactive power under participating in the markets. These profile and schedule consider the DERs and network constraints simultaneously, and explore arbitrage opportunities of VPP. Results pertaining to an illustrative example and a case study are discussed.	0.2
Recently, deep learning has gained prominence due to the potential it portends for machine learning. For this reason, deep learning techniques have been applied in many fields, such as recognizing some kinds of patterns or classification. Intrusion detection analyses got data from monitoring security events to get situation assessment of network. Lots of traditional machine learning method has been put forward to intrusion detection, but it is necessary to improvement the detection performance and accuracy. This paper discusses different methods which were used to classify network traffic. We decided to use different methods on open data set and did experiment with these methods to find out a best way to intrusion detection.	0.2
The field of stem cell biology, cell therapy, and regenerative medicine has expanded almost exponentially, in the last decade. Clinical trials are evaluating the potential therapeutic use of stem cells in many adult and pediatric lung diseases with vascular component, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Extensive research activity is exploring the lung resident and circulating progenitor cells and their contribution to vascular complications of chronic lung diseases, and researchers hope to use resident or circulating stem/progenitor cells to treat chronic lung diseases and their vascular complications. It is becoming more and more clear that progress in mechanobiology will help to understand the various influences of physical forces and extracellular matrix composition on the phenotype and features of the progenitor cells and stem cells. The current review provides an overview of current concepts in the field.	6.1
Drug release belongs to the most challenging aspects of nanoparticles addressing molecular biology and medicine. Besides targeted delivery, obvious challenges are related to high drug load and continuous slow drug release. Based on our recently developed concept of inorganic-organic hybrid nanoparticles (IOH-NP), we here present [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) IOH-NPs containing the analgetic phosphate prodrug acetaminophen phosphate for drug release. [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) combines an uncomplex synthesis in water with a high prodrug load of 68 wt.%.[ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) nanoparticles exhibit a diameter of 37(11) nm and can be readily obtained as colloidally highly stable suspension in water. The chemical composition is studied in detail based on infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, thermogravimetry and elemental analysis. Moreover, the release of acetaminophen from [ZrO](2+)[AAP](2-) is studied by means of model experiments indicating the carbon content of the nanoparticles and, in alternative, the fluorescence of labeled nanoparticles. Both data show a continuous release of 80 wt.% of the analgetic acetaminophen on a time scale up to 48 h. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	6.0
The light emitting diode (LED) based visible light communication (VLC) system can provide lighting and communication simultaneously. It has attracted much attenuation recently. As the photovoltaic cell (also known as solar cell) is physically flexible, low cost, and easily available, it could be a good choice for the VLC receiver (Rx). Furthermore, besides acting as the VLC Rx, the solar cell can convert VLC signal into electricity for charging up the Rx devices. Hence, it could be a promising candidate for the future internet-of-thing (IoT) networks. However, using solar cell as VLC Rx is challenging, since the response of the solar cell is highly limited and it will limit the VLC data rate. In this work, we propose and demonstrate for the first time using pre-distortion Manchester coding (MC) signal to enhance the signal performance of solar cell Rx based VLC. The proposed scheme can significantly mitigate the slow response, as well as the direct-current (DC) wandering effect of the solar cell; hence 50 times increase in data rate can be experimentally achieved.	1.0
This study investigates the neuroprotective properties of berberine (a natural isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the Rhizoma coptidis) and finds that berberine could promote beta-amyloid (A beta) clearance and inhibit A beta production in the triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3 x Tg-AD). During the study, berberine was first administrated to treat 3 x Tg-AD mice and primary neurons. Morris water maze assay, western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence staining and histological analysis, transmission electron microscopic analysis were then used to evaluate the effects of the berberine administration. The result showed that berberine significantly improved 3 x Tg-AD mice's spatial learning capacity and memory retention, promoted autophagy activity identified by the enhancement of brain LO-II, beclin-1, hVps34, and Cathepsin-D levels as well as the reduction of brain P62 and Bcl-2 levels in AD mice, facilitated reduction of AV, and APP levels, reduced A beta plaque deposition in the hippocampus of AD mice, and inhibited b-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression. Similar results were also found in 3 x Tg-AD primary hippocampal neurons: berbernine treatment decreased the levels of extracellular and intracellular A beta 1-42, increased the protein levels of 10-11, beclin-1, hVps34, and Cathepsin-D, and decreased the levels of P62. Bcl-2, APP and BACE1 levels. In summary, berberine shows neuroprotective effects on 3 x Tg-AD mice and may be a promising multitarget drug in the preventionand protection against AD.

With information becoming a first-class citizen on the Internet, information-centric networking (ICN) is considered as a promising direction for the future Internet. Named data networking (NDN) is a prominent example of emerging ICN architectures. Unfortunately, NDN is vulnerable to various attacks targeting its in-network caching mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the false-locality pollution attack, in which an adversary repeatedly requests a number of unpopular data objects to waste the precious cache space on the NDN router and to reduce normal users' hit ratios. With simulation experiments, we show that such an attack can cause considerable damage to the NDN network. To detect and mitigate such an attack, we introduce an algorithm that exploits the diversity of the Interest traversing paths within an Internet service provider's point-of-presence network. We also propose inexpensive methodologies based on the probabilistic counting and Bloom filter techniques to implement the algorithm on an NDN router. The experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm is effective in thwarting false-locality pollution. We also experiment with strategies that the adversary may utilize against our antipollution algorithm and demonstrate that such strategies are either ineffective or impractical in the real world.	0.2
Language provides rich social information about its speakers. For instance, adults and children make inferences about a speaker's social identity, geographic origins, and group membership based on her language and accent. Although infants prefer speakers of familiar languages (Kinzler, Dupoux, & Spelke, 2007), little is known about the developmental origins of humans' sensitivity to language as marker of social identity. We investigated whether 9-month-olds use the language a person speaks as an indicator of that person's likely social relationships. Infants were familiarized with videos of two people who spoke the same or different languages, and then viewed test videos of those two individuals affiliating or disengaging. Results suggest that infants expected two people who spoke the same language to be more likely to affiliate than two people who spoke different languages. Thus, infants view language as a meaningful social marker and use language to make inferences about third-party social relationships.	2.1
A new major version of the European severe accident integral code ASTEC, developed by IRSN with some GRS support, was delivered in November 2015 to the ASTEC worldwide community. Main modelling features of this V2.1 version are summarised in this paper. In particular, the in-vessel coupling technique between the reactor coolant system thermal-hydraulics module and the core degradation module has been strongly re-engineered to remove some well-known weaknesses of the former V2.0 series. The V2.1 version also includes new core degradation models specifically addressing BWR and PHWR reactor types, as well as several other physical modelling improvements, notably on reflooding of severely damaged cores, Zircaloy oxidation under air atmosphere, corium coolability during corium concrete interaction and source term evaluation. Moreover, this V2.1 version constitutes the back-bone of the CESAM FP7 project, which final objective is to further improve ASTEC for use in Severe Accident Management analysis of the Gen.II-III nuclear power plants presently under operation or foreseen in near future in Europe. As part of this European project, IRSN efforts to continuously improve both code numerical robustness and computing performances at plant scale as well as users' tools are being intensified. Besides, ASTEC will continue capitalising the whole knowledge on severe accidents phenomenology by progressively keeping physical models at the state of the art through a regular feed-back from the interpretation of the current and future experimental programs performed in the international frame.

The optimal design of electrical machines is an important issue in automotive industry in order to reduce cost and volume of the actuator and improve its performances. In this context, the use of compact machines with high power density is preferred and consequently high speed machines where field weakening is required. In addition, a really optimal design requires to dispose sufficiently accurate models of main physical phenomena involved in electromechanical conversion. This models need to be sufficiently fast in order to be suitable with optimization process. An important limitation in the use of internal permanent magnet synchronous machine with distributed windings is temperatures insides the machine especially in the windings and thus the internal losses. At high speed with field weakening operation, iron losses, sensitive to flux densities variation in iron, could be really high because of the high electrical frequency linked to rotor speed and sharp variation of flux density waveforms inside the iron in stator due to the field weakening operation. This study, for the electric machine design, is based on the first harmonic hypothesis, i.e., without harmonic currents. An original and mathematical model has been developed and provides fast and accurate estimation of iron losses particularly in field weakening operation even with machine supplied by sinusoidal currents as described in this paper. It uses a polynomial form of iron losses in function of fundamental electrical frequency and take into account the flux density waveforms in yoke and teeth by use of nonlinear iron coefficients linked to i(d)-i(q) currents. This paper will present the complete method calculating the iron coefficients from a nonlinear magnetic nodal network of the machine. A detailed study of local flux density waveform and harmonic content in yoke and teeth will be provided for two particular operating points: at maximal power without field weakening and at maximal power at maximal speed. These two points require accurate estimation in an optimal design of electrical machine. In addition, the local iron coefficients in teeth and yoke per volume unit will be provided in order to study the local evolution of iron losses in field weakening operation. It will show that iron losses do not follow the same evolution in the yoke and the teeth by the fact that the flux density distribution in teeth is more sensitive to the field weakening. An application of this model will be provided for the calculation of iron losses on whole operating space for a specific machine. A comparison will be provided between the fast model and finite elements approach. (C) 2016 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The implant metal for minimally invasive repair (Nuss procedure) of pectus excavatum (PE) often causes metal allergy and postoperative infection. Titania/chitosan has anti-allergy and anti-inflammatory effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of titania/chitosan on Nuss repair of PE patients with stainless steel. Methods: A total 828 PE patients were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups: one group received Nuss repair using stainless steel (SS group) and another group using stainless steel coated by Titania/chitosan (SSTc group). Infection rate, metal allergy and Haller Index were measured. The presence of overt infection was evaluated by measuring serum levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: After mean 24-month Nuss repair, postoperative infection occurred in 26 cases (6.3%) and 2 cases (0.5%) in SS and SSTc groups (P < 0.05), respectively. On the other hand, 14 cases (3.4%) and 0 case (0%) suffered from bar allergy for implant metal in SS and SSTc groups, respectively (P3.0 cm needing reoperation in SS and SSTc groups (P < 0.05), respectively. After surgery (18-34 month), serum levels of ESR and CRP were higher in SS group than in SSTc group in non-infected patients (P < 0.05). Comparatively, the serum levels of ESR and CRP were significantly higher in SS group than in SSTc group in infected patients (P = 0.01). Conclusion: The stainless steel coated by Titania/chitosan provides a safer and more effective material for Nuss repair of PE by reducing the metal allergies, infection rates and reoperation rates.	5.1
Conditional differential cryptanalysis on NFSR-based cryptosystems was first proposed by Knellwolf et al. in Asiacrypt 2010 and has been successfully used to attack reduced variants of Grain v1. In this paper, we greatly improve conditional differential attacks on Grain v1 in the following four aspects. First, a new differential engine is derived to correctly track the differential trails of Grain v1. Second, we propose a new difference-searching strategy which serves to find suitable differences for the conditional differential attack on a given reduced variant of Grain v1. Third, a highly IV-saving condition-imposing strategy is presented. Last, we propose a further bias-increasing strategy. In particular, the improvements on the difference-searching strategy and the condition-imposing strategy are crucial to mount conditional differential attacks on the variants of Grain v1 with more than 106 rounds. It is shown that the improved conditional differential attacks could retrieve 31 distinct secret key expressions for 107-round Grain v1 and could retrieve 15 distinct secret key expressions for 110-round Grain v1. Both the attacks succeed with constant probabilities. Thus far, our results are the best known for the reduced variants of Grain v1 as far as the number of rounds attacked is concerned.	0.3
Introduction: Longitudinal imaging of neurodegenerative disorders is a potentially powerful biomarker for use in clinical trials. In Alzheimer's disease, studies have demonstrated that empirically derived regions of interest (ROIs) can provide more reliable measurement of disease progression compared with anatomically defined ROIs. Methods: We set out to derive ROIs with optimal effect size for quantifying longitudinal change in a hypothetical clinical trial by comparing atrophy rates in 44 patients with behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 30 with the semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), and 26 with the nonfluent variant PPA (nfvPPA) to atrophy in 97 cognitively healthy controls. Results: The regions identified for each variant were generally what would be expected from prior studies of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Sample size estimates for detecting a 40% reduction in annual rate of ROI atrophy varied substantially across groups, being 103 per arm in bvFTD, 31 in nfvPPA, and 10 in svPPA, but in all groups were less than those estimated for a priori ROIs and clinical -measures. The variability in location of peak regions of atrophy across individuals was highest in bvFTD and lowest in svPPA, likely relating to the differences in effect size. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, while cross-validated maps of change can improve sensitivity to change in FTLD compared with a priori regions, the reliability of these maps differs considerably across syndromes. Future studies can utilize these maps to design clinical trials, and should try to identify factors accounting for the variability in patterns of atrophy across individuals, particularly those with bvFTD.	5.2
Work in this paper presents the results of field testing on four instrumented roadway sections constructed on poor subgrade soils and stabilized with select fill, geosynthetics, or cement. Loading was applied using 1000 consecutive truck passes and profile surveying was performed to provide permanent deformation (rutting) data. Peak vertical stresses at the subgrade as well as moisture conditions were also monitored during testing. Results indicated that the deep undercut (31 in./790 mm) with select material backfill section produced the largest cumulative rut depths due to shallow incremental plastic strains induced during each axle pass. The use of a thin Aggregate Base Course (ABC) surface layer (3 in./75 mm) over the select material reduced the rate of rutting. The biaxial geogrid and the high strength geotextile showed a relatively equal performance in all aspects of the study. The cement stabilized section produced a slightly larger average rut depth than the geosynthetically-reinforced sections due to localized areas of pronounced cumulative rutting. However, there were several areas of the soil-cement test section that performed as well as the geosynthetically-reinforced sections.	4.1
Security is essential to enable the Internet of Things (IoT). Key security measures that work well on the traditional Internet, however, do not necessarily adapt well to the IoT. Specifically, authentication and/or authorization based on certificates provided by certificate authorities (CAs) cannot, in current form, scale to the expected 50 billion devices. And widely used encryption technologies for the Internet require too much energy for resource-constrained devices. This paper describes a secure network architecture with key distribution mechanisms using local, automated authorization entities. The architecture provides security guarantees while addressing IoT-related issues including resource constraints. For evaluation, we show that the architecture's overhead scales at a significantly slower rate than widely used SSL/TLS and works well with resource-constrained devices.	0.2
The flatness of the KH2PO4 (KDP) crystal has important effect on the inertial confinement fusion system. The method to improve the flatness of KDP crystal and its implementation in the machine tool design is presented in this paper. The finite element model of the whole machine tool is built up to describe the tool tip displacement with the cutting force along the cutting path. The influence of the axial and radial bearing stiffness of the aerostatic spindle on the machined surface flatness is discussed. Furthermore, a novel adjusting mechanism which is used to adjust the squareness between the spindle and the slide is designed, and a new machining process is proposed to improve the flatness of the machined surface. The machining trials are carried out to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of the presented approach and simulation.	3.3
A precise transpiration prediction model thus becomes an important tool for greenhouse automatic irrigation management. Moreover, leaf is an organ of transpiration, and leaf area index is a basic variable to estimate this water lost, but it is still a weak spot in the crop growth estimation. In this paper, two different leaf area index models are established and compared with the evolution of the real crop determined with an electronic planimeter: (1) Considering the temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as the main impact factors over crop growth, a TEP-LAI model based on product of thermal effectiveness and PAR is built to estimate the leaf area index dynamics; and (2) TOM-LAI model based on a tomato growth model is also used to estimate the leaf area index as an explicit function of the number of leaves and vines. Finally, the results of both simulation models (TEP-LAI and TOM-LAI) are compared with the measured values. Moreover, a crop transpiration model is established using the empirical data sampled in a multi-span greenhouse in Almeria (Spain). In this greenhouse, a microlysimeter (two different weight scales) was used to obtain the transpiration and the drainage values. Thus, the data collected is used to obtain a model of the estimated water lost by transpiration, that it is based on Back Propagation-Neural Network was optimized using genetic algorithm and Nonlinear Auto-regressive model with Exogenous Inputs model. Once described the different models, the estimated values of leaf area index are compared satisfactorily with the measured ones. TEP-LAI is the model chosen to be introduced as input of the final transpiration model. As expected, the transpiration estimation with inside conditions generates better results, but the outside climate based model shows that it could be used as an irrigation predictor with data from cheaper outside meteorological stations.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Cognitive training can allow patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to reinforce individual cognitive abilities. In the present case study, we investigated the generalizability of trained cognitive skills to novel tasks, and their stability over time.One AD patient underwent a structured cognitive training using the GEO (Geographical Exercise for cognitive Optimization) task, whereas eight AD patients underwent a control cognitive intervention. Participants' performances on the GEO task, on a similar untrained cognitive task, and on a different untrained cognitive task were recorded before and after the intervention, and at the follow-up. On both the trained and the similar untrained tasks patients' and controls' performance significantly differed from one another. Our preliminary evidence shows that a cognitive training could allow patients to improve and maintain their performance not only on the trained task, but also on a similar task.	5.2
Convolutional neural network (CNN), a well-known machine learning algorithm, has been widely used in the field of computer vision for its amazing performance in image classification. With the rapid growth of applications based on CNN, various acceleration schemes have been proposed on FPGA, GPU and ASIC. In the implementation of these specific hardware accelerations, the most challenging part is the implementation of 2D convolution. To obtain a more efficient design of 2D convolution in CNN, this paper proposes a novel technique, singular value decomposition approximation (SVDA) to reduce the usage of resources. Experimental results show that the proposed SVDA hardware implementation can achieve a reduction in resources in the range of 14.46% to 37.8%, while the loss of classification accuracy is less than 1%.	0.0
The aim of this study was to determine if wearing a wrist guard in snowsports impacted on fracture site in the wrist. Participants presenting to two Australian resort medical centres with wrist fractures for one month in peak season 2010 were invited to participate. Differences between the mean distance ratio of the fracture site in the wrist were determined between the guard wearing and non-guard wearing populations using analysis of variance. The mean distance of the wrist fracture sites in the forearm from the wrist joint was 2.8 (SD 1.8) times the radius diameter in individuals who reported using guards and in non-guard wearers was 2 (SD 1.3) times the radius diameter. No significant difference was found in the distance of fracture from the wrist joint between these two groups (F=62.8 p>0.08). (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variants are widely used tools for studying protein localization and dynamics of events such as cytoskeletal remodeling and vesicular trafficking in living cells. Quantitative methodologies using chimeric GFP fusions have been developed for many applications; however, GFP is somewhat resistant to proteolysis, thus its fluorescence persists in the lysosome/vacuole, which can impede quantification of cargo trafficking in the endocytic pathway. An alternative method for quantifying endocytosis and post-endocytic trafficking events makes use of superecliptic pHluorin, a pH-sensitive variant of GFP that is quenched in acidic environments. Chimeric fusion of pHluorin to the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane cargo proteins results in a dampening of fluorescence upon incorporation of the cargo into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and delivery to the lysosome/vacuole lumen. Thus, quenching of vacuolar fluorescence facilitates quantification of endocytosis and early events in the endocytic pathway. This paper describes methods using pHluorin-tagged cargos for quantification of endocytosis via fluorescence microscopy, as well as population-based assays using flow cytometry.	6.0
Geosynthetics is the umbrella term for thin, flexible material sheets applied in civil and environmental engineering, of which geotextiles form the largest group. Most geotextiles consist of a polymer from the polyolefin, polyester or polyamide family, and additives to improve their stability. The polymer may degrade into microplastic particles over time and under various conditions and can cause adverse effects, as species may ingest these particles or encounter adverse effects due to the interference of the particles with e.g. their photosynthesis system in the case of algae. Leaching of additives may occur from the intact material, as they are often not covalently bound to the polymer backbone, but is greatly enhanced when micro-sized plastic particles have been formed. A total of 42 polymer additives were identified, of which 26 had ecotoxicity information available in terms of a REACH persistence, toxicity and bioaccumulation (PBT) assessment. Of these, 15 were classified as (very) persistent and 2 as toxic. A survey to assess potential toxicity of the remaining 16 substances revealed that no ecotoxicity studies had been performed on 13 of these compounds. For 3 compounds, other toxicity data was found, as well as of several chemical groups known to be used as additives in geotextiles. The current knowledge is thus lacking in two domains: on the one hand, ecotoxicity data is scarce as many substances have not yet been the subject of ecotoxicological studies. On the other hand, in situ toxic effects might be missed by the current approach of single compound toxicity testing. Moreover, environmental occurrence data of the additives are extremely scarce.

Purpose of review Loss of body mass and exercise intolerance are common findings in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are often difficult to reverse despite optimal nutritional intake. Similar findings have been reported in healthy individuals during high-altitude exposure. The role of hypoxia in modulating metabolism has been largely investigated in vitro and in animal studies. More fragmentary is the knowledge regarding hypoxia effects on invivo human metabolism. This paper reviews recent literature regarding the effects of chronic exposure to hypoxia on metabolism, particularly comparing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with humans exposed to high altitude. Recent findings Hypoxia has important metabolic effects. Many oxygen-sensitive regulatory mechanisms work through hypoxia inducible factor 1, and recent literature regarding the hypoxic stimulus and its pathological implications deals largely with hypoxia inducible factor 1-related findings. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 is pivotal in the adaptation to chronic hypoxia: it induces gene expression for fructose-2-6-biphosphatase, an enzyme switching glucose metabolism towards glycolysis, allowing energy production in anaerobic conditions. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 is also involved in the development of anorexia because it induces the promoter of the leptin gene. Particularly important for future therapeutic implications are findings related to hypoxia inducible factor 1 polymorphism and interaction with other molecules, especially estrogens, in the clinical evolution of disease. Summary Malnutrition is a worsening factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Similarities between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and altitude exposure point to the importance of hypoxia in this regard. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will help to find alternative therapeutic approaches.	6.2
Transportation biofuel production efficiencies and cruising ranges provided by one hectare of land are studied from a life cycle perspective in the boreal climate zone. Efficient biofuel production is essential in terms of sustainability - especially land use, biodiversity and GHG emissions. Grass methane produced by anaerobic digestion and synthetic natural gas (SNG) produced from willows by gasification provide the longest cruising ranges. However, electricity production by solar panels for electric vehicles is a significantly more efficient option than biofuels. Grass methane, straw ethanol and SNG require less primary energy per produced fuel energy than other options. Increasing biofuel production for passenger cars from cultivated biomass in the boreal climate zone should be very carefully considered because electricity for transportation is significantly more efficient.

Multi-proxy signature is a variant of proxy signature, which allows that a delegator (original signer) may delegate his signing rights to many proxy signers. Comparing with proxy signatures, multi-proxy signatures can effectively prevent that some of proxy signers abuse signing rights. Also, with the rapid development of identity-based cryptography, identity-based multi-proxy signature (IBMPS) schemes have been proposed. Comparing with proxy signature based on public key cryptography, IBMPS can simplify key management and be used for more applications. Presently, many identity-based multi-proxy signature schemes have been proposed, but most of them are constructed in the random oracle model. Also, the existing security model for identity-based multi-proxy signature is not enough complete according to the Boldyreva et al.'s work. In this paper, we present a framework for IBMPS on n + 1 users (n is the number of proxy signers participating in signing), and show a detailed security model for IBMPS. Under our framework, we present an identity-based multi-proxy signature scheme in the standard model. Comparing with other identity-based multi-proxy signature schemes, the proposed scheme has more complete security	0.3
Introduction: Unwanted mental intrusions (UMI) constitute the normal variants of obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), preoccupations about defects in Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), images about illness in Hypochondriasis (HYP), and thoughts about eating in Eating Disorders (EDs). We sought to investigate the relationships between frequency and discomfort associated with the experience of the four UMI contents, adopting a within-subject perspective. Method: A group of 438 university students and community participants (Mage= 29.84, SD= 11.41; 70.54% women), completed the Questionnaire of Unpleasant Intrusive Thoughts to assess the frequency and discomfort of four UMI contents related to OCD, BDD, HYP and EDs. Results: Just over 76% of participants reported having experienced the four sets of intrusions. The ED-related were the most frequent but the least disturbing, whereas HYP intrusions were the least frequent but the most disturbing. The four UMI were significantly related to each other, both in frequency and discomfort. Women experienced OCD, BDD, and ED-related intrusions more frequently than men. Age was negatively associated with the frequency and distress of the four UMIs. Conclusions: UMIs might be a transdiagnostic variable across different disorders such as OCD, BDD, EDs, and Hypochondriasis, and they might contribute to explaining the phenomenological similarities among them.	5.4
Is there a dark side to organic food? Eskine reported that participants exposed to organic food became much more morally judgmental and much less prosocial relative to participants exposed to neutral or comfort foods. This research sparked tremendous media interest, but was based on one experiment with a small sample size. We report three attempts to replicate Eskine using samples conferring high power, preregistered analysis plans, and original materials. Across two direct replications and an online conceptual replication, we found that organic food exposure has little to no effect on moral judgments (d = 0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.14, 0.26], N = 377) and prosocial behavior (d = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.23], N = 377). Mere exposure to organic food is probably not sufficient to substantially change moral behavior.	2.4
A root-zone water balance model was used to simulate the soil moisture storage of maize (Zea mays L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields in rainfed uplands of eastern India. The simulation study revealed that short duration (95 days) rice fields in uplands remained under ponding condition for a period of 32 days during the entire growing season. Based on the ponding depth requirement in rice fields (50 mm), excess ponding was found for seven days only out of the 32 days of ponding. In contrast, the maize field under similar length of growing season (95 days) and topographic condition could produce harvestable runoff for 23 days. Furthermore, the rice crop was to remain under moisture stress for eight days during its mid-season stage, whereas the maize was found to be without stress during entire growing season. Before sowing of winter crops, the soil moisture in the seeding zone was determined to be depleted below germination soil moisture for 18 and 19 years out of 30 years of simulation in rice and maize fields, respectively. This implies that a second crop, following withdrawal of monsoon, is not possible without pre-sowing irrigation in three out of five years in rainfed uplands. Thus, complete substitution of rice by maize in uplands would create a better scope for rainwater harvesting. Alternatively, partial replacement of rice could be a viable option for meeting both rice demand of the people and harvesting of adequate rainwater for supplemental irrigation to crops in rainy and winter seasons.

Pro-environmental behavioural spillover when performing one pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) increases the likelihood of performing another has been identified as a possible way to increase the amount of environmentally friendly behaviours that individuals perform. The current research investigated this spillover process, the role of chronic environmental motivations, goal priming and behavioural similarity. Three studies (two conducted with students and one conducted with the general Australian public) provided evidence to suggest that positive spillover occurs between PEBs that are similar in terms of the resources required to perform them, but not between PEBs that are resource-dissimilar. There was no evidence to suggest that negative spillover (the instance where performing one PEB lessens the likelihood of subsequently performing another) occurred. Chronic environmental striving seems to independently influence the performance of PEBs, especially spending time to be more environmentally friendly. The role of priming goals in the spillover process remains unclear. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	2.4
Aims/hypothesis: The adipokine adiponectin has insulin-sensitising, anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, the genes for mouse and human adiponectin receptor-1 (ADIPOR1) and -2 (ADIPOR2) have been cloned. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variants of the genes encoding ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 play a role in human metabolism. Materials and methods: We screened ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 for polymorphisms and determined their association with glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, an atherogenic lipid profile and inflammatory markers in 502 non-diabetic subjects. A subgroup participated in a longitudinal study; these subjects received diet counselling and increased their physical activity. Results: We identified six variants of ADIPOR1 and seven variants of ADIPOR2. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the putative promoter region 8503 bp upstream of the translational start codon (-8503 G/A) of ADIPOR1 (frequency of allele A=0.31) was in almost complete linkage disequilibrium with another SNP (-1927 T/C) in intron 1. Subjects carrying the -8503 A and -1927 C alleles had lower insulin sensitivity, as estimated from a 75 g OGTT (p=0.04) and determined during a euglycaemic clamp (n=295, p=0.04); they also had higher HbA(1)c levels (p=0.02) and, although the difference was not statistically significant, higher liver fat (n=85, determined by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, p=0.056) (all p values are adjusted for age, sex and percentage of body fat). In the longitudinal study (n=45), the -8503 A and -1927 C alleles were associated with lower insulin sensitivity (p=0.03) and higher liver fat (p=0.02) at follow-up compared with the -8503 G and -1927 T alleles, independently of basal measurements, sex and baseline and follow-up percentage of body fat. Conclusions/interpretation: The present findings suggest that the -8503 G/A SNP in the promoter or the -1927 T/C SNP in intron 1 of ADIPOR1 may affect insulin sensitivity and liver fat in humans.	6.2
This exploratory study utilized a concurrent triangulation mixed methods design to investigate how parents respond to considerate and engaging forms of children's prosocial behavior, whether some prosocial behaviors are more likely to receive reinforcement, and whether reinforcement is associated with specific types of prosocial behavior. Parents of 74 preschoolers completed a questionnaire regarding their child's general prosociality, provided open-ended responses to prosocial vignettes, and completed a questionnaire assessing reinforcement. Open-ended responses showed reinforcement was highly variable across parents and prosocial behaviors. Across open-ended and response-option formats, social reinforcement responses of parent approval, character attributions, and showing love emerged as common reinforcement responses to prosocial behavior, and evidencing similar relationships with comforting and cooperating behaviors. These results suggest that there are multiple ways parents respond to child prosocial behaviors, many of which seem to be attempts to encourage prosociality.	2.4
Thermal modeling is used for thermal investigation and optimization of sensors, instruments, and structures. Here, results depend on the chosen modeling approach, the complexity of the model, the quality of material data, and the information about the heat transport conditions of the object of investigation. Despite the widespread application, the advantages and limits of the modeling approaches are partially unknown. For comparison of different modeling approaches, a simplified and analytically describable demonstration object is used. This object is a steel rod at well-defined heat exchange conditions with the environment. For this, analytically describable models, equivalent electrical circuits, and simple and complex finite-element-analysis models are presented. Using the different approaches, static and dynamic simulations are performed and temperatures and temperature fields in the rod are estimated. The results of those calculations, comparisons with measurements, and identification of the sensitive points of the approaches are shown. General conclusions for thermal modeling of complex equipment are drawn.	1.2
The effect of four different mulches on fruit quality was quantified, either directly via mineral nutrient contributions or indirectly, by increasing nutrient uptake efficiency in the soil. We hypothesised that fruit nutrient levels would increase more when an organic mulch, containing nutrients, was applied to the soil, with smaller/no increases when an inorganic mulch was applied to the tree row. In this paper, we concentrate on changes in fruit phosphorus (P) concentrations after application of five treatments: a clean cultivated control, an inorganic woven geotextile fabric, and organic mulches - compost, wood chips and a vermi-castings/wood chips combination. The trial was conducted on a commercial farm, Lourensford Estate, South Africa, from October 2008 to April 2012 - on an adjacent light, sandy and heavier, sandy-silt soil. Mineral nutrient analyses of the soil, leaves, mulches and fruit were performed. Yield and fruit size were determined. Soil temperatures and soil water status were recorded hourly during the last two seasons. P concentrations did increase chronologically from the soil, then into leaves and then into the fruit after application of mulches that provided additional P to the soil. Sporadic increases in both leaves and fruit occurred, but could not always be related to treatment effects. The significant consistent increase of P levels of the vermi- castings treatment in the heavy soil is likely to be a combination of reduced irrigation volumes, as well as a treatment effect. All mulches resulted in the well-established buffering of soil temperatures, soil water content and percentage soil carbon. Based on results from this study, it is not feasible to apply mulches for the sole purpose to increase P levels in the soil, leaves or fruit of established trees - although increases were noticed from time to time. In addition to water and temperature modifying effects of mulches that would differ between soil textures and depend on the mulch source, increases in P concentrations may result. As yield efficiency is still the primary factor determining income per hectare for the producer, the decrease in yield that resulted from mulching under these conditions, will still outweigh any positive contributions of mulches. It is therefore of utmost importance to first adjust irrigation volumes to a mulch treatment before the advantageous properties of mulching will be of value.	4.1
We propose an ultra-lightweight, compact, and low power block cipher BORON. BORON is a substitution and permutation based network, which operates on a 64-bit plain text and supports a key length of 128/80 bits. BORON has a compact structure which requires 1939 gate equivalents (GEs) for a 128-bit key and 1626 GEs for an 80-bit key. The BORON cipher includes shift operators, round permutation layers, and XOR operations. Its unique design helps generate a large number of active S-boxes in fewer rounds, which thwarts the linear and differential attacks on the cipher. BORON shows good performance on both hardware and software platforms. BORON consumes less power as compared to the lightweight cipher LED and it has a higher throughput as compared to other existing SP network ciphers. We also present the security analysis of BORON and its performance as an ultra-lightweight compact cipher. BORON is a well-suited cipher design for applications where both a small footprint area and low power dissipation play a crucial role.	0.3
Advances in clinical immunology in the past year included the report of practice parameters for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiencies to guide the clinician in the approach to these relatively uncommon disorders. We have learned of new gene defects causing immunodeficiency and of new phenotypes expanding the spectrum of conditions caused by genetic mutations such as a specific regulator of telomere elongation (RTEL1) mutation causing isolated natural killer cell deficiency and mutations in ras-associated RAB (RAB27) resulting in immunodeficiency without albinism. Advances in diagnosis included the increasing use of whole-exome sequencing to identify gene defects and the measurement of serum free light chains to identify secondary hypogammaglobulinemias. For several primary immunodeficiencies, improved outcomes have been reported after definitive therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy.	6.3
Static VAR compensators (SVC) can improve some of the power quality (PQ) indices such as voltage flicker, unbalances, and power factors in power systems if properly controlled. Different nonlinear and time-varying loads generate these parameters. One of the great nonlinear loads is the electric arc furnace (EAF), which causes waveform distortions, voltage unbalances, and fluctuations. In this paper, a new digital and prediction-based control for thyristor switched capacitors (TSCs) was proposed to compensate an actual steel industrial plant. The digital control was based on generating adequate synchronous pulses, calculating required suitable susceptance, and measuring correct reactive power. The proposed TSC improved the PQ by means of the feedback from voltage and power factor. A predictive method based on time series and recursive least square with dynamic learning factor was then applied to estimate EAF reactive power in the future so that the TSC performance was enhanced by reducing the natural time delay. A band-pass harmonic filter was designed to compensate the load current harmonics and to protect the capacitor banks in the TSC. Finally, the suggested TSC was implemented in a steel industrial plant as an actual power system with 2 EAFs. The modeling and experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed TSC.	1.4
The number of times a scientific article has been cited reflects its impact on a specific field. Highly cited articles are known as citation classics. Here, we aim to characterize the most frequently cited articles in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). We searched the ISI Web of Science in Aug 2016 for articles that were cited 100 times or more and evaluated them for several characteristics. The most frequently cited article received 955 citations. The citations mean was 221.6 citations (SD = 162.7). The most recent article was published in 2011. The articles were published in 36 journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine. Overall authors came from 17 countries, with the United States of America (USA) contributing to 91 (80%) articles. The National Institute of Health was the most common institution of origin for the corresponding author. The most common type of articles was basic science with 77 (67%) articles. These results provide some insights into the most cited research articles in CGD since its first description 60 years ago.	6.3
Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an oncogenic virus causing hemangiomas and myeloid tumors in chickens. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional pro-inflammatory interleukin involved in many types of cancer. We previously demonstrated that IL-6 expression was induced following ALV-J infection in chickens. The aim of this study is to characterize the mechanism by which ALV-J induces IL-6 expression, and the role of IL-6 in tumor development. Our results demonstrate that ALV-J infection increases IL-6 expression in chicken splenocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. IL-6 production is induced by the ALV-J envelope protein gp85 and capsid protein p27 via PI3K- and NF-kappa B-mediated signaling. IL-6 in turn induced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and its receptor, VEGFR-2, in vascular endothelial cells and embryonic vascular tissues. Suppression of IL-6 using siRNA inhibited the ALV-J induced VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 expression in vascular endothelial cells, indicating that the ALV-J-induced VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 expression is mediated by IL-6. As VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 are important factors in oncogenesis, our findings suggest that ALV-J hijacks IL-6 to promote tumorigenesis, and indicate that IL-6 could potentially serve as a therapeutic target in ALV-J infections.	6.3
We introduce a versatile carrier system for in vitro and in vivo immune stimulation based on soft matter DNA nanoparticles (NPs). The incorporation of lipid-modified nucleotides into DNA strands enables the formation of micelles of uniform size. In a single self-assembly step, the micelles can be equipped with immune adjuvant (CpG) motifs and fluorescent probes. The immunological effects of CpG confined at the NP surface were studied in a comprehensive manner in animal experiments. Dose-dependent activation of spleen dendritic cells (DCs) by CpG-conjugated NP was observed, which was accompanied by the pronounced up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecule and cytokine production.

In the summer of 1967, a relatively complete skeleton of a juvenile was excavated from the Ishkeenickh River Cave Site (now the Ksi Hlginx River) in British Columbia, Canada, dating from approximately 2000 years ago. This individual, likely aged between 10 and 12 years at time of death, displays osteological features consistent with a chronic arthropathy. The most striking pathological changes are on the spine, with bony ankylosis present on several of the cervical and thoracic vertebrae. Lesions can also be observed on the ribs, the ilia, the femora, and a tibia. The arthritic conditions of juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile-onset adult-type rheumatoid arthritis, along with Klippel-Feil syndrome, are possible aetiologies discussed as part of a differential diagnosis. The presence of post-mortem damage as well as missing bones makes an absolute diagnosis of a disease impossible, however the lesions present on this skeleton seem to be most consistent with juvenile-onset ankylosing spondylitis. The majority of published research on these diseases appears in clinical contexts, therefore this case study represents a unique opportunity to observe the bony changes that occur with juvenile idiopathic arthritis in the context of palaeopathology.

Water pollution by pharmaceutically active compounds is an emerging issue. Toxicological studies reveal that pharmaceuticals are indeed toxic for living organisms. The lack of suitable treatment technology for the complete removal of pharmaceuticals is therefore a major challenge. Advanced oxidation processes are emerging removal techniques that have many advantages versus conventional technologies. Many studies indicate that advanced oxidation processes, either in single or in combination with other degradation techniques, can enhance the degradation of pharmaceuticals in aqueous solutions. Here, we review the degradation of pharmaceuticals by sonolysis, an oxidation processes using ultrasound. In this technique, hydroxyl radicals are generated by pyrolytic cleavage of water molecules. We review the influence of operational parameters, additives and hybrid techniques on the degradation of pharmaceuticals. The maximum degradation of organic compounds was observed in the frequency range of 100-1000 kHz, which is in the high-frequency medium-power ultrasound. Even though almost all the experiments presented more than 90 % removal and good biodegradability of the target compound, good mineralization and the toxicity removal were hardly achieved. The efficiency of the degradation varies with water matrixes and varying pH. Major pathways of degradation are hydroxylation, dehalogenation, demethylation, decarboxylation, deamination, etc. More hybrid techniques have to be developed to scale up the application of ultrasound.	4.4
The effects of Low Impact Development (LID) practices on urban runoff and pollutants have proven to be positive in many studies. However, the effectiveness of LID practices can vary depending on different urban patterns. In the present study, the performance of LID practices was explored under three land uses with different urban forms: (1) a compact high-density urban form; (2) a conventional medium-density urban form; and (3) a conservational medium-density urban form. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used and model development was performed to reflect hydrologic behavior by the application of LID practices. Rain gardens, permeable pavements, and rainwater harvesting tanks were considered for simulations, and a modeling procedure for the representation of LID practices in SWAT was specifically illustrated in this context. Simulations were done for each land use, and the results were compared and evaluated. The application of LID practices demonstrated a decrease in surface runoff and pollutant loadings for all land uses, and different reductions were represented in response to the land uses with different urban forms on a watershed scale. In addition, the results among post-LIDs scenarios generally showed lower values for surface runoff and nitrate in the compact high-density urban land use and for total phosphorus in the conventional medium-density urban land use compared to the other land uses. We suggest effective strategies for implementing LID practices.	4.3
Congenital causes of erythrocytosis are now more easily identified due to the improvement of the molecular characterization of many of them. Among these causes, hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity take a large place. The aim of this work was to reevaluate the diagnostic approach of these disorders. To assess the current practices, we sent a questionnaire to the expert laboratories in the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies in France and Belgium. In parallel, we gathered the methods used for the diagnosis of the hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity indexed in the international database HbVar. Even though they remain a rare cause of erythrocytosis (1 to 5 positive diagnosis every year in each of the questioned specialized laboratories), hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity are increasingly suspected by clinicians. Phenotypic it enables the finding of 93% of them in the questioned laboratories (28 of the 30 variants diagnosed during the last 5 years). Among the 96 hemoglobin variants with high oxygen affinity indexed in the international database, 87% could be diagnosed with phenotypic techniques. A direct measure of the p50 with the Hemox-Analyzer is included in the diagnostic approach of half of the laboratories only, because of the poor availability of this apparatus. Comparatively, the estimation of p50 by blood gas analyzers on venous blood is a much more convenient and attractive method but due to the lack of proof as to its effectiveness in the diagnosis of hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity, it requires further investigations. Beta- and alphaglobin genes analysis by molecular biology techniques is essential as it either allows a quick and definite identification of the variant or definitely excludes the diagnosis. It is thus systematically performed as a first or second step method, according to the laboratory practice.	6.0
As maize was domesticated in Mexico around 9,000years ago, local farmers have selected and maintained seed stocks with particular traits and adapted to local conditions. In the present day, many of these landraces are still cultivated; however, increased urbanization and migration from rural areas implies a risk that this invaluable maize germplasm may be lost. In order to implement an efficient mechanism of conservation in situ, the diversity of these landrace populations must be estimated. Development of a method to select the minimum number of samples that would include the maximum number of alleles and identify germplasm harboring rare combinations of particular alleles will also safeguard the efficient ex-situ conservation of this germplasm. To reach this goal, a strategy based on SSR analysis and a novel algorithm to define a minimum collection and rare genotypes using landrace populations from Puebla State, Mexico, was developed as a proof of concept for methodology that could be extended to all maize landrace populations in Mexico and eventually to other native crops. The SSR-based strategy using bulked DNA samples allows rapid processing of large numbers of samples and can be set up in most laboratories equipped for basic molecular biology. Therefore, continuous monitoring of landrace populations locally could easily be carried out. This methodology can now be applied to support incentives for small farmers for the in situ conservation of these traditional cultivars.	6.0
This paper discusses the automated visual identification of individual great white sharks from dorsal fin imagery. We propose a computer vision photo ID system and report recognition results over a database of thousands of unconstrained fin images. To the best of our knowledge this line of work establishes the first fully automated contour-based visual ID system in the field of animal biometrics. The approach put forward appreciates shark fins as textureless, flexible and partially occluded objects with an individually characteristic shape. In order to recover animal identities from an image we first introduce an open contour stroke model, which extends multi-scale region segmentation to achieve robust fin detection. Secondly, we show that combinatorial, scale-space selective fingerprinting can successfully encode fin individuality. We then measure the species-specific distribution of visual individuality along the fin contour via an embedding into a global 'fin space'. Exploiting this domain, we finally propose a non-linear model for individual animal recognition and combine all approaches into a fine-grained multi-instance framework. We provide a system evaluation, compare results to prior work, and report performance and properties in detail.	0.0
Today's network is distributed and heterogeneous in nature and has numerous applications which affect day to day life, such as e-Banking, e-Booking of tickets, on line shopping etc. Hence the security of the network is crucial. Threats in the network can be due to intrusions. Such threats can be observed and handled using Intrusion Detection System. The security can be achieved using intrusion detection system, which observes the data traffic and identifies it as an intrusion or not. The objective of this paper is to design a model using game theoretic approach for intrusion detection. Game model is designed by defining players, strategies and utility functions to identify the Probe attacks. This model is tested with NSLKDD data set. The model is the Probe attacks are identified by dominated strategies elimination method. Experimental results shows that game model identifies the attacks with good detection rate.	0.2
In this paper, we present a numerical solution method which is based on Taylor Matrix Method to give approximate solution of the Bagley-Torvik equation. Given method is transformed the Bagley-Torvik equation into a system of algebraic equations. This algebraic equations are solved through by assistance of Maple 13. Then, we have coefficients of the generalized Taylor series. So, we obtain the approximate solution with terms of the generalized Taylor series. Further some numerical examples are given to illustrate and establish the accuracy and reliability of the proposed algorithm.	3.4
The confounded signal hypothesis maintains that facial expressions of anger and happiness, in order to more efficiently communicate threat or nurturance, evolved forms that take advantage of older gender recognition systems, which were already attuned to similar affordances. Two unexplored consequences of this hypothesis are (1) facial gender should automatically interfere with discriminations of anger and happiness, and (2) controlled attentional processes (like working memory) may be able to override the interference of these particular expressions on gender discrimination. These issues were explored by administering a Garner interference task along with a working memory task as an index of controlled attention. Results show that those with good attentional control were able to eliminate interference of expression on gender decisions but not the interference of gender on expression decisions. Trials in which the stimulus attributes were systematically correlated also revealed strategic facilitation for participants high in attentional control.	2.1
Mismatch removal is a key step in many computer vision problems. In this paper, we handle the mismatch removal problem by adopting shape interaction matrix (SIM). Given the homogeneous coordinates of the two corresponding point sets, we first compute the SIMs of the two point sets. Then, we detect the mismatches by picking out the most different entries between the two SIMs. Even under strong affine transformations, outliers, noises, and burstiness, our method can still work well. Actually, this paper is the first non-iterative mismatch removal method that achieves affine invariance. Extensive results on synthetic 2D points matching data sets and real image matching data sets verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our method in removing mismatches. Moreover, when applied to partial-duplicate image search, our method reaches higher retrieval precisions with shorter time cost compared with the state-of-the-art geometric verification methods.	0.0
With water scarcity becoming an increasingly critical issue for modern society, solar seawater desalination represents a promising approach to mitigating water shortage. In addition, solar seawater desalination shows great potential for mitigating the energy crisis due to its high photo-thermal conversion efficiency. However, the increasing contamination of seawater makes it difficult to generate clean water through simple desalination processes. In this work, clean water is generated by a,newly designed bifunctional Au@TiO2 core-shell nanoparticle film with a high photo-thermal conversion efficiency that is capable of photocatalysis and solar evaporation for seawater desalination. Bifunctional films of Au@TiO2 core-shell nanoparticles with good stability were prepared. It was found that the formation of the core-shell structures played a key role in promoting the photo-thermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation of seawater, while the photocatalytic function demonstrated herein could contribute to the purification of polluted seawater. Furthermore, the film structure can serve to concentrate the NPs for the photo-reaction, as well as heat for water evaporation, improving both the photo-reaction efficiency and photo-thermal conversion efficiency. This efficient approach to solar seawater desalination, which combines evaporation with the photodegradation of pollutants, could help to address the dual issues of water scarcity and water pollution.

The renal glomerulus consists of glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, and mesangial cells, which cooperate with each other for glomerular filtration. We have produced monoclonal antibodies against glomerular cells in order to identify different types of glomerular cells. Among these antibodies, the E30 clone specifically recognizes the Thy1.1 molecule expressed on mesangial cells. An injection of this antibody into rats resulted in mesangial cell-specific injury within 15 min, and induced mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in a reproducible manner. We examined the role of mesangial cells in glomerular function using several experimental tools, including an E30-induced nephritis model, mesangial cell culture, and the deletion of specific genes. Herein, we describe the characterization of E30-induced nephritis, formation of the glomerular capillary network, mesangial matrix turnover, and intercellular signaling between glomerular cells. New molecules that are involved in a wide variety of mesangial cell functions are also introduced.	6.1
BACKGROUND: In 2014, the European Society for Immune Deficiencies (ESID) revised the common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) diagnosis criteria by incorporating new clinical and biological markers. The new definition appeared more restrictive but had not yet been evaluated in a large cohort of patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of this new definition in a large cohort of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia. METHODS: Evaluation of 3 different CVID definitions (ESID/Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency [PAGID] 1999, ESID 2014, DEFI 2015) in 521 patients included in the French DEFI study with a diagnosis of primary hypogammaglobulinemia. RESULTS: Using the ESID/PAGID 1999 definition, 351 patients were classified as CVID. The new ESID 2014 definition excluded 62 (18%) patients. Most of them (n [56; 90%) had a less severe disease, whereas 6 (10%) presented with a severe disease with major T-cell defect. We propose different criteria (occurrence of opportunistic infection or very low naive CD4D T-cell count) to define this population with severe T-cell defect. Sixty-two patients fulfilled these criteria, represented 20% of the initial CVID population but accounted for 77% of the deaths, with a 5-year overall survival of 67.6% (95% confidence interval, 51.0-79.6), and were considered as late onset combined immunodeficiency (LOCID). CONCLUSIONS: The new ESID definition for CVID still fails to exclude a large number of patients with severe T-cell defect. We propose a new definition (DEFI 2015) that excluded more patients with a T-cell defect and consider these patients as LOCID. This population has a poor outcome and should be considered as a distinct group requiring specific care. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.	6.3
An approximately 59-year (1955-2014) sedimentary record of metal elements (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Mn, and Fe) in a sediment core, collected from the Huaihe River, Huainan City, Anhui Province, China, was reconstructed by using Pb-210 geochronology. Copper, Zn, Ni, Co, and Mn evaluated by enrichment factor (EF) indicated minor contamination due to water pollution accidents of the Huaihe River that occurred in 1990s and 2004. Lead presented the most severe pollution among the metals studied, especially during 1957-1974. The use of leaded petrol and atmospheric deposition of coal combustion flue gases could have contributed to Pb contamination. In spite of the general good quality (mean sediment pollution index (SPI) 35.69) of the sediment core evaluated by SPI based on the principal component analysis, worse sediment qualities in the upper section (<6 cm, 2004) were still observed, suggesting intensive human activities causing the increasing concentrations of metals in recent decades.	4.4
This article describes a creative design activity to introduce engineering students to mechatronic prototyping. Our goal was to find a creative task to increase student confidence and skills in mechanical design, electrical circuits, microcontrollers, and programming. We present the Paper Robot exercise, a design activity that blends everyday materials such as cardboard, with electronic components. This activity was introduced during the 2010-2011 academic year and has been repeated every year since, in a global, industry-sponsored design course at Stanford University. The Paper Robot exercise resulted from the observation that students were intimidated to create functional prototypes with microcontrollers. The teaching team needed a way to quickly introduce tools for programming electronic components and to encourage creative experimentation early in the course. Results include a 100% task performance rate of students that successfully made a robot meeting the minimum requirements. 76% of students reported an increase in knowledge in programming microcontrollers (Arduino), and 69% increased their knowledge in creating electronic circuits out of raw components. This activity may be modified to introduce younger students to mechatronic platforms in STEM education curriculum.	1.2
Background: Hypertension or high blood pressure is on the rise. Not only does it affect the elderly but is also increasingly spreading to younger sectors of the population. Treating this condition involves exhaustive monitoring of patients. The current mobile health services can be improved to perform this task more effectively. Objective: To develop a useful, user-friendly, robust and efficient app, to monitor hypertensive patients and adapted to the particular requirements of hypertension. Methods: This work presents BPcontrol, an Android and iOS app that allows hypertensive patients to communicate with their health-care centers, thus facilitating monitoring and diagnosis. Usability, robustness and efficiency factors for BPcontrol were evaluated for different devices and operating systems (Android, iOS and system-aware). Furthermore, its features were compared with other similar apps in the literature. Results: BPcontrol is robust and user-friendly. The respective start-up efficiency of the Android and iOS versions of BPcontrol were 2.4 and 8.8 times faster than a system-aware app. Similar values were obtained for the communication efficiency (7.25 and 11.75 times faster for the Android and iOS respectively). When comparing plotting performance, BPcontrol was on average 2.25 times faster in the Android case. Most of the apps in the literature have no communication with a server, thus making it impossible to compare their performance with BPcontrol. Conclusions: Its optimal design and the good behavior of its facilities make BPcontrol a very promising mobile app for monitoring hypertensive patients.	0.4
The aim of the study was to compare clinical manifestations, disease activity, functional capacity, spinal mobility, and radiological findings between men and women from a multicenter, multiethnic Ibero-American cohort of patients with Spondyloarthritis (SpA). This observational cross-section study included 1264 consecutive SpA patients who fulfilled the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data were evaluated. Categorical data were compared by chi(2) or Fisher's exact tests and continuous variables by ANOVA with post-hoc tests. Primary AS was diagnosed in 1072 patients, psoriatic spondylitis in 147, and spondylitis associated to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 45 patients. Overall, male patients were significantly younger, had longer diagnostic delay, lower disease activity, worse spinal mobility, better quality of life, and more severe radiologic damage. Dactylitis and enthesitis, as well as swollen joint count, were significantly more common among women. In primary AS, there was a marked male predominance (76.2%). Among patients with psoriatic spondylitis, male predominance was lower (57.8%), but was also associated with worse spinal mobility and more severe radiologic damage. In the total population, male patients with primary AS referred higher permanent work disability (13.2% vs 6.9%; P<0.05), although no difference was observed in psoriatic or IBD spondylitis according to the gender. Among Ibero-American SpA patients, there are some differences in clinical and radiological manifestations, men showing more structural damage, whereas women more active disease. These data suggest that the phenotype of SpA differs between genders. This can influence the subsequent diagnostic approach and therapeutic decisions.	5.3
A 1 kW-class electrochemical reactor for hydrogen production was developed using bipolar plates. To fabricate thick, large-area electrodes, a particle electrode fabrication method was also introduced. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and galvanostatic performance measurements were performed to evaluate the particle electrodes. The results show that the particle electrodes exhibit an excellent charge performance despite the electrode material layer being relatively thick and highly porous. The electrochemical reactor contained 20 single cells stacked together with 30 A h of nickel hydroxide and 15 A h of metal hydride as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical tests showed that the stack exhibited a high hydrogen production efficiency with a maximum current efficiency of 95.3% for hydrogen production and a hydrogen evolution amount per unit input electrical energy of 259.1 mL/W h at 0.2 C. At high current densities (2.0 C), a rapid temperature increase was also observed during the charging process, which led to a reduction of the hydrogen production efficiency. Therefore, further design modifications are needed to control heat generation during operation of the device. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	1.0
What Kirchhoff actually did concerning spanning trees in the course of his classic paper in the 1847 Annalen der Physik und Chemie has, to some extent, long been shrouded in myth in the literature of Graph Theory and Mathematical Chemistry. In this review, Kirchhoff's manipulation of the equations that arise from application of his two celebrated Laws of electrical circuits - formulated in the middle of the 19th century - is related to 20th-and 21st-century work on the enumeration of spanning trees. It is shown that matrices encountered in an analysis of what Kirchhoff really did include (a) the Kirchhoff (Laplacian, Admittance) matrix, K, that features in the well-known Matrix Tree Theorem, (b) the matrix G encountered in the theorem of Gutman, Mallion & Essam (1983), applicable only to planar graphs, and (c) the analogous matrix M that arises in the Cycle Theorem (Kirby et al. 2004), a theorem that applies to graphs of any genus. It is concluded that Kirchhoff himself was not interested in counting spanning trees, and, accordingly, he did not explicitly do so. Nevertheless, it is shown how the modulus of the determinant of a certain matrix (here denoted by the label C') - associated with the linear equations arising from application of Kirchhoff's two Laws - is numerically equal to the number of spanning trees in the graph representing the connectivity of the electrical network being studied. Kirchhoff did, however, invoke the concept of spanning trees, introducing them in a complementary fashion by referring to the chords that must be removed from the original graph in order to form such trees. It is further emphasised that, in choosing the cycles in the network being studied, around which to apply his circuit Law, Kirchhoff explicitly selected what would now be called a 'Fundamental System of Cycles'.	1.2
Heterotrimeric G proteins signal at a variety of endomembrane locations, in addition to their canonical function at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (PM), where they are activated by cell surface G protein-coupled receptors. Here we focus on signaling at the Golgi, where activates a signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in vesicle fission from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). To develop a novel molecular tool for inhibiting endogenous in a spatial-temporal manner, we take advantage of a lipid association mutant of the widely used inhibitor GRK2ct (GRK2ct-KERE) and the FRB/FKBP heterodimerization system. We show that GRK2ct-KERE cannot inhibit function when expressed in cells, but recruitment to a specific membrane location recovers the ability of GRK2ct-KERE to inhibit signaling. PM-recruited GRK2ct-KERE inhibits lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas Golgi-recruited GRK2ct-KERE inhibits cargo transport from the TGN to the PM. Moreover, we show that Golgi-recruited GRK2ct-KERE inhibits model basolaterally targeted but not apically targeted cargo delivery, for both PM-destined and secretory cargo, providing the first evidence of selectivity in terms of cargo transport regulated by . Last, we show that Golgi fragmentation induced by ilimaquinone and nocodazole is blocked by inhibition, demonstrating that is a key regulator of multiple pathways that impact Golgi morphology. Thus, we have developed a new molecular tool, recruitable GRK2ct-KERE, to modulate signaling at specific subcellular locations, and we demonstrate novel cargo selectivity for regulation of TGN to PM transport and a novel role for in mediating Golgi fragmentation.	6.1
Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) remains a major complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with a significant proportion of patients failing to respond to first-line systemic corticosteroids. Reliable biomarkers predicting disease severity and response to treatment are warranted to improve its management. Thus, we sought to determine whether pentraxin 3 (PTX3), an acutephase protein produced locally at the site of inflammation, could represent a novel acute GvHD biomarker. Using a murine model of the disease, we found increased PTX3 plasma levels after irradiation and at GvHD onset. Similarly, plasma PTX3 was enhanced in 115 pediatric patients on day of transplantation, likely due to conditioning, and at GvHD onset in patients experiencing clinical symptoms of the disease. PTX3 was also found increased in skin and colon biopsies from patients with active disease. Furthermore, PTX3 plasma levels at GvHD onset were predictive of disease outcome since they resulted significantly higher in both severe and therapyunresponsive patients. Multiple injections of rhPTX3 in the murine model of GvHD did not influence the disease course. Taken together, our results indicate that PTX3 constitutes a biomarker of GvHD severity and therapy response useful to tailor treatment intensity according to early risk-stratification of GvHD patients.	6.3
This study developed a novel mobile industrial-scale fluidized adsorption process and preliminarily explored its application in the emergency water treatment. A lab-based Liquid-Solid Circulating Fluidized Bed (LSCFB) was prepared and the flow pattern was studied by validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The simulation results revealed that the particular uneven flow structure, which could weaken aniline removal performance, occurred with increasing superficial liquid velocity. Accordingly, an optimized distributor design was constructed by the established CFD models; notably, the effect of open angles on the flow pattern, which was often overlooked by previous studies, was mainly discussed. Then, the aniline removal efficiency of LSCFB pre and post optimization was compared. The experimental results demonstrate that dynamic adsorption capacity on aniline reached 70 mg/g under the optimum conditions (initial aniline concentration of 100 mg/L, superficial liquid velocity of 3u(mf) and sorbent dosage of 27 g/L). By comparison with fixed-bed adsorption, the LSCFB possessed significantly higher adsorption rate constants and shorter hydraulic retention time, which indicates that LSCFB could meet emergency treatment requirements in a better way. Finally, the study developed the mobile industrial-scale fluidized adsorption process and estimated process parameters for aniline removal in the Sudden Water Pollution Accident of Zhuozhang River.

Digital control in switching power converters has been proposed and researched in recent years. However, one of the problems which arise in these circuits is that of quantization-induced limit cycle oscillations, which are generally considered to be undesirable. In this work, we investigate the addition of new control terms in the feedback loop of the system, in order to actively prevent these limit cycles from occurring. Firstly, the addition of a sinusoidal signal is considered, and then a more complicated signal which focuses on interrupting how the system switches between duty cycle levels is presented. The methods are effective in removing the limit cycle oscillations which arise in the system. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	1.4
This paper presents a power electronic converter used to redistribute the power among the phases in unbalanced power systems, which is supposed to be designed based on the involved degree of unbalance. A bidirectional converter is chosen for this purpose, whose modeling is presented in the dq0 system. This solution can be considered as part of a unified control system, where conventional active power filters may be solely responsible for compensating harmonics and/or the tuning of passive filters becomes easier, with consequent reduction in involved costs in a decentralized approach. The adopted control strategy is implemented in digital signal processor TMS320F2812, while experimental results obtained from an experimental prototype rated at 17.86 kVA are properly discussed considering that the converter is placed at the secondary side of a transformer supplying three distinct single-phase loads. It is effectively shown that the converter is able to balance the currents in the transformer phases, thus leading to the suppression of the neutral current.	1.4
Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid found in many plants and is used as a nutritional supplement. It has been reported to have biological properties that may play an important role in the prevention of human diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, ulcer, cataract and allergies. In this research, solidified floating organic drop microextraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography was used to extract and determine quercetin in Rosa canina L., growing in different areas of Lorestan Province in Iran. The effect of important experimental variables such as type and volume of extracting organic solvent, extraction temperature and time, pH and effect of ionic strength on the extraction recovery was investigated and optimized. Under the optimum extraction conditions, a linear response was obtained over the range of 0.5-40 A mu g mL(-1). Relative standard deviation (RSD%) and enrichment factor were found to be 3.4% and 230, respectively. The proposed method was applied successfully for the determination of quercetin in calycles and fruit of R. canina L. samples. The results showed good agreement compared with those obtained by a validated standard method .	5.1
A new photochromic diarylethene bearing naphthyl unit was synthesized efficiently. Its photochromic properties and the fluorescence property were examined in hexane solution and in PMMA film. The concentration effect in hexane solution was investigated also. The results indicated that the photochromic diarylethene have good photochromic property and exhibit remarkable fluorescence switching property and when the concentration at 2 x 10(-5) mol/L the fluorescence peak have the maximum.	3.2
Grid voltage feedforward is extensively used for controlling grid-connected converters. However, the conventional voltage feedforward control reduces the stability margins of the converter connected to a high-impedance grid. The effect mechanism of voltage feedforward on the grid-connected converter control under high-inductive conditions of the grid impedance is clearly explained in this study using the equivalent transformations of control block diagrams. Results show that the delay produced by the digital control is the root cause of this effect. An improved voltage feedforward strategy, in which a bandpass filter (BPF) is introduced into the feedforward path, is proposed to strengthen the converter's robust stability against grid impedance variations. The selection method of the BPF's bandwidth is also provided considering the tradeoff between the response speed to the grid voltage sag and the system's robust stability. The converter can work stably over a wide range of the grid impedance through the proposed approach. Simulation and experimental results fully verify the effectiveness of the BPF-based voltage feedforward strategy.	1.4
Water erosion causes soil degradation and nonpoint pollution. Pollutants are primarily transported on the surfaces of fine soil and sediment particles. Several soil loss models and empirical equations have been developed for the size distribution estimation of the sediment leaving the field, including the physically-based models and empirical equations. Usually, physically-based models require a large amount of data, sometimes exceeding the amount of available data in the modeled area. Conversely, empirical equations do not always predict the sediment composition associated with individual events and may require data that are not always available. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a model to predict the particle size distribution (PSD) of eroded soil. A total of 41 erosion events from 21 soils were used. These data were compiled from previous studies. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were used to identify the main variables controlling sediment PSD. These variables were the particle size distribution in the soil matrix, the antecedent soil moisture condition, soil erodibility, and hillslope geometry. With these variables, an artificial neural network was calibrated using data from 29 events (r(2) = 0.98, 0.97, and 0.86; for sand, silt, and clay in the sediment, respectively) and then validated and tested on 12 events (r(2) = 0.74, 0.85, and 0.75; for sand, silt, and clay in the sediment, respectively). The artificial neural network was compared with three empirical models. The network presented better performance in predicting sediment PSD and differentiating rain-runoff events in the same soil. In addition to the quality of the particle distribution estimates, this model requires a small number of easily obtained variables, providing a convenient routine for predicting PSD in eroded sediment in other pollutant transport models.

Rapid and progressive advances in molecular biology techniques and the advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have opened new possibilities for analyses also in the identification of entomological matrixes. Insects and other arthropods are widespread in nature and those found at a crime scene can provide a useful contribution to forensic investigations. Entomological evidence is used by experts to define the postmortem interval (PMI), which is essentially based on morphological recognition of the insect and an estimation of its insect life cycle stage. However, molecular genotyping methods can also provide an important support for forensic entomological investigations when the identification of species or human genetic material is required. This case study concerns a collection of insects found in the house of a woman who died from unknown causes. Initially the insects were identified morphologically as belonging to the Pediculidae family, and then, human DNA was extracted and analyzed from their gastrointestinal tract. The application of the latest generation forensic DNA assays, such as the Quantifiler (R) Trio DNA Quantification Kit and the HID-Ion AmpliSeq (TM) Identity Panel (Applied Biosystems (R)), individuated the presence of human DNA in the samples and determined the genetic profile.

In the present paper, a new memristor based oscillator is obtained from the autonomous Jerk circuit [Kengne et al., Nonlinear Dynamics (2016) 83: 751-765] by substituting the nonlinear element of the original circuit with a first order memristive diode bridge. The model is described by a continuous time four-dimensional autonomous system with smooth nonlinearities. Various nonlinear analysis tools such as phase portraits, time series, bifurcation diagrams, Poincare section and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents are exploited to characterize different scenarios to chaos in the novel circuit. It is found that the system experiences period doubling and crisis routes to chaos. One of the major results of this work is the finding of a window in the parameters' space in which the circuit develops hysteretic behaviors characterized by the coexistence of four different (periodic and chaotic) attractors for the same values of the system parameters. Basins of attractions of various coexisting attractors are plotted showing complex basin boundaries. As far as the authors' knowledge goes, the novel memristive jerk circuit represents one of the simplest electrical circuits (no analog multiplier chip is involved) capable of four disconnected coexisting attractors reported to date. Both PSpice simulations of the nonlinear dynamics of the oscillator and laboratory experimental measurements are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We examine the transient evolution of a negatively buoyant, laminar plume in an emptying filling box containing a uniform porous medium. In the long time limit, tau ->infinity, the box is partitioned into two uniform layers of different densities. However, the approach towards steady state is characterized by a lower contaminated layer that is continuously stratified. The presence of this continuous stratification poses non-trivial analytical challenges; we nonetheless demonstrate that it is possible to derive meaningful bounds on the range of possible solutions, particularly in the limit of large mu, where mu represents the ratio of the draining to filling time scales. The validity of our approach is confirmed by drawing comparisons against the free turbulent plume case where, unlike with porous media plumes, an analytical solution that accounts for the time-variable continuous stratification of the lower layer is available (Baines & Turner, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 37, 1969, pp. 51-80; Germeles, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 71, 1975, pp. 601-623). A separate component of our study considers time-variable forcing where the laminar plume source strength changes abruptly with time. When the source is turned on and off with a half-period, Delta tau, the depth and reduced gravity of the contaminated layer oscillate between two extrema after the first few cycles. Different behaviour is seen when the source is merely turned up or down. For instance, a change of the source reduced gravity leads to a permanent change of interface depth, which is a qualitative point of difference from the free turbulent plume case.	3.4
The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has provided a unique remote sensing capability for observing key variables of the hydrological cycle, such as the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). However, due to some limitations related to the instrument interferometric concept and its challenging data processing, SMOS SSS maps still display significant artifacts and biases, especially close to the coast, mainly due to the presence of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) and Land-sea contamination (LSC). In this paper, a new methodology for filtering salinity retrievals and correcting for spatial biases is introduced and validated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	4.2
Additive manufacturing technologies enable the fabrication of parts characterized by shape complexity and therefore allow the design of optimized components based on minimal material usage and weight. In the literature two approaches are available to reach this goal: adoption of lattice structures and topology optimization. In a recent work a Computer-Aided method for generative design and optimization of regular lattice structures was proposed. The method was investigated in few configurations of a cantilever beam, considering six different cell types and two load conditions. In order to strengthen the method, in this paper a number of test cases have been carried out. Results explain the behavior of the method during the iterations, and the effects of the load and of the cell dimension. Moreover, a visual comparison between the proposed method and the results achieved by topology optimization is shown.	3.0
Research into individual differences in interpersonal accuracy (IPA; the ability to accurately judge others' emotions, intentions, traits, truthfulness, and other social characteristics) has a long tradition and represents a growing area of interest in psychology. Measuring IPA has proved fruitful for uncovering correlates of this skill. However, despite this tradition and a considerable volume of research, very few efforts have been made to look collectively at the nature of the tests involved in assessing IPA, leaving questions of the broader structure of IPA unresolved. Is IPA a single skill or a clustering of many discrete skills or some combination of partially overlapping skills? In a multi-level meta-analysis of 103 published and unpublished participant samples (13,683 participants), we analyzed 622 correlations between pairs of IPA tests (135 different IPA tests altogether). The overall correlation between IPA tests was r = .19, corrected for the nesting of correlations within the studies that administered more than two IPA tests and reported several correlations for the same participant sample. Test domain and characteristics were evaluated to explain differences in effect sizes; in general, tests in similar domains and using similar methodologies were more highly correlated with each other, suggesting that there are domains within which individual differences cluster. Implications for future research and IPA measurement were discussed.	2.3
Flow cytometry has contributed to virology but has faced many drawbacks concerning detection limits, due to the small size of viral particles. Nonetheless, giant viruses changed many concepts in the world of viruses, as a result of their size and hence opened up the possibility of using flow cytometry to study them. Recently, we developed a high throughput isolation of viruses using flow cytometry and protozoa co-culture. Consequently, isolating a viral mixture in the same sample became more common. Nevertheless, when one virus multiplies faster than others in the mixture, it is impossible to obtain a pure culture of the minority population. Here, we describe a robust sorting system, which can separate viable giant virus mixtures from supernatants. We tested three flow cytometry sorters by sorting artificial mixtures. Purity control was assessed by electron microscopy and molecular biology. As proof of concept, we applied the sorting system to a co-culture supernatant taken from a sample containing a viral mixture that we couldn't separate using end point dilution. In addition to isolating the quick-growing Mimivirus, we sorted and re-cultured a new, slow-growing virus, which we named Cedratvirus. The sorting assay presented in this paper is a powerful and versatile tool for separating viral populations from amoeba co-cultures and adding value to the new field of flow virometry.	6.0
This paper presents theoretical and practical results about dynamic analysis, frequency response, and control of a LLC resonant dc/dc converter operating under wide input voltage and load variations. A nonlinear model for the LLC resonant converter was developed using the extended describing function method; then, based on the derived model, a nonlinear observer-based controller was designed and implemented with a digital signal processor. Transient responses obtained under input voltage and output load variations show that the proposed controller is capable to stabilize the output effectively. Experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed observer-based controller over a conventional PID controller.	1.4
The empirical literature on the energy efficiency gap concentrates on demand inefficiencies in the energy-using durables markets and finds evidence that consumers underestimate future energy costs when purchasing a new appliance. We take a broader view and also consider the impact of imperfect competition. Using data on the UK refrigerator market (2002-2007), we find that the average energy consumption of appliances sold during this period was only 7.2% higher than what would have been observed under a scenario with a perfectly competitive market and non-myopic consumers. One reason for this small gap is that market power actually reduces energy use. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1.0
Digitally controlled permanent-magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) exhibit bandwidth limitations imposed by delay. In high power applications such as rail transit, the negative impact of delay is particularly serious due to the low switching frequency of the inverter. In this paper, the causes and effects of time delay are analyzed, and the sampling delay is greatly reduced by using multiple sampling method. Test results are given to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.	1.4
Digital stabilization of unstable equilibria of linear systems may lead to small amplitude stochastic-like oscillations. We show that these vibrations can be related to a deterministic chaotic dynamics induced by sampling and quantization. A detailed analytical proof of chaos is presented for the case of a PD controlled oscillator: it is shown that there exists a finite attracting domain in the phase-space, the largest Lyapunov exponent is positive and the existence of a Smale horseshoe is also pointed out. The corresponding two-dimensional micro-chaos map is a multi-baker map, i.e. it consists of a finite series of baker's maps.	1.4
Although much is known about the hydraulics of xylem, the hydraulic interconnectivity and dimensional scaling of phloem with respect to xylem in leaves has not been adequately studied to test alternative hydraulic architectural rules such as da Vinci's rule or Murray's rule, or physiological models such as Munch's Pressure Flow hypothesis. Using confocal and electron microscopy as well as mathematical analyses, we examined the hydraulic architecture of the mature leaves of the model species Populus tremula 9 alba across all seven hierarchical orders of the vascular branching. We show that: phloem and xylem conductive areas increase from minor to major veins; the sum of the conductive areas for each vein order increases exponentially from major to minor veins; the volume of individual sieve tube and vessel members increases from minor to major veins; and phloem conductive area scales isometrically with respect to xylem area across all vein orders. The application of first principles to our data shows that conductive areas scale according to da Vinci's rule and not according to Murray's rule, and that the phloem network in poplar leaves can generate the pressure gradient envisioned in Munch's hypothesis.	3.1
We examine the relationship between TV viewing and economic expectations during economic recession. A content analysis of 84 hours of local network primetime programming (news and nonnews) identifies a moderate bias toward economic pessimism in the broadcasts. A survey of the adult population (N = 356) points at a significant positive relationship between TV viewing (total viewing and viewing of news programming) and economic pessimism at both the national and the personal levels. A similar relationship exists between TV viewing and optimistic biasthe tendency to be more pessimistic on economic matters at the national than at the personal level. These results remain significant when controlled for demographics, trust in national institutions, evaluation of current economic situation and consumption of media other than TV, and corroborate a second-order cultivation effect in the economic context.	2.2
Group signature scheme is a method of allowing a member of a group to sign a message anonymously on behalf of the group. The group administrator is in charge of adding group members and has the ability to reveal the original signer in the event of disputes. Based on controlled quantum teleportation with three-particle entangled W states, we propose a new quantum group signature scheme with designated receiver. Security analysis proves that the proposed scheme possesses the characteristics of group signature and resists the usual attacks. Compared with previous proposed schemes, this scheme follows security definition of group signature fully and meets its basic requirements.	0.3
In order to improve the efficiency of product design and reuse in heterogeneous system of knowledge sharing, this paper introduced the concept of ontology into product variant design, and grinding machine design was as an example. A lot of experience and accumulated knowledge in product design was shared and reused. It is precisely to formulate ontology knowledge such as variant design features and parameter, and applied the software protege4.3 to construct ontology model, as well as runed resoning on model data information. It developed a set of complete product intelligent system of variant design, which can effectively solve the problem of the repeated design and greatly shorten product development cycle.	3.3
In recent years parallel computing has been widely employed for both science research and commercial applications. For parallel systems such as many-core or computer clusters, it is inevitable to have one or more computing node failures due to random errors or injected attacks. Usually a diagnosis mechanism is able to locate several defective nodes through a number of tests and the analysis of those test signatures (syndromes). Although this covers the cases caused by random errors, sophisticated attacks are still able to manipulate the outputs of each node, so that they will be masked and pass the diagnosis. Therefore in this paper we propose a hybrid self-diagnosis mechanism. We adopt a new type of analysis with the linear syndromes, which are able to locate up to a certain number of defective nodes caused by random errors. In addition to this, we introduce a new type of robust analysis of the non-linear syndromes, which is capable of detecting the attacks undetectable by the linear syndromes at a probability close to one. Moreover, since this hybrid self-diagnosis mechanism is on the data level which makes little distinction among different operating systems and programming languages, it can be migrated onto any other platforms conveniently.	0.4
Background: Mobile phoned-based interventions have been increasingly used in clinical populations to improve health and health care delivery. The literature has shown that mobile phone-based text messages (short message service, SMS) are instantaneous, cost effective, and have less chance of being misplaced. Studies using mobile phone based-text messages have reported text messages as effective reminders that have resulted in increased appointment attendance, adherence to treatment, and better self-management. There have been no reports of adverse events when using text messaging in terms of misreading or misinterpreting data, transmitting inaccurate data, losing verbal or nonverbal communication cues, privacy issues, or failure or delay in message delivery. However, the literature has cited a need for personalized messages that are more responsive to individual needs. In addition, there has been a dearth of information on the use of reminders in nonclinical populations. Objective: The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of adding reminders in the form of text messaging versus reminder calls versus text messages and reminder calls to increase use of service referrals provided through community outreach. Methods: A total of 300 participants will be recruited for the study. Each participant will be randomized to one of three arms: a group that receives only reminder calls (CALLSONLY); a group that receives only text message reminders (TEXTONLY); and a group that receives both reminder calls and text messages (CALLS+ TEXT). All groups will receive their reminder intervention on the 15th and 45th day after baseline when they receive medical and social service referrals from the community health workers (CHWs). A standard script will be used to administer the call and text reminders and a 15-item telephone-based satisfaction survey will be administered to assess the participant satisfaction with the process of receiving periodic reminders. Results: The study is in the recruitment and follow-up phase. The authors anticipate completion of recruitment, interventions, and data entry by July 2016. Preliminary results are expected to be available by September 2016. Conclusions: This study will provide an opportunity to test the effectiveness of mobile-based interventions on nonclinical, community-recruited populations. In particular, such a protocol would increase the effectiveness of a community-based engagement program by instating a formal reminder system for all program members who receive social and/or medical service referrals during outreach in the community. Findings from this study would guide the development and implementation of reminder protocols for community-based engagement programs nationwide.	2.3
Recently, bearingless switched reluctance motor (BLSRM) has been received more and more attention. To realize the stable levitation and rotation, the corresponding suspending force and torque should be controlled. In this paper, different from the conventional bearingless SRM control, one independent control scheme for levitation force and torque is presented. In the control, a complex control algorithm based on a lookup table is not needed. Torque control is separated from radial force control, and each channel of radial force is independently controlled. Therefore, the control is very simple to be implemented. First, based on the brief introduction of the BLSRM structure and operating principle, the mathematical relationship of levitation force with respect to current and displacement is derived. Furthermore, the rotor dynamics model, in which levitation force in four degrees of freedom is considered, is established. Based on the given analysis, the digital control system, which includes torque and suspending force, is designed by means of TMS320F28335, and an experimental platform is established. According to the experimental results, the proposed BLSRM can be steadily levitated in the static and rotating conditions.	1.4
This paper pursues an inquiry into the relationship between ethnicity and development in the largest authoritarian country in the contemporary world, the People's Republic of China. It engages the theoretical literature on ethnic diversity and development in general, but also pays special attention to political economy logics unique to authoritarian systems. Focusing on the western part of China over a decade since the launch of China's Western Development Program (xibu da kaifa) in 2000, this paper utilizes the data from two censuses (2000 and 2010) together with nighttime streetlight imagery data to analyze the overall relationship between ethnicity and development provision. It also analyzes changes in such a relationship during this period. The paper finds that ethnic minority concentration negatively correlates with economic development in both the years 2000 and 2010 across the western provinces. It also finds that counties in non-autonomous provinces, which are historically more integrated with the rest of China than autonomous provinces, have a positive and systematic correlation between changes in ethnic minority concentration and changes in development during the 10-year period. The counties in autonomous provinces, on the other hand, show the opposite trend. Using three case studies of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, the paper concludes that although there is in general a tendency for ethnic minority concentrated areas to be less developed, ultimately which groups prosper more or less depends upon specific economic development and which political control logics the Chinese state implements.

The HomyGene19+14Y System (HG19+14Y) is a PCR-based amplification kit that enables typing of 18 autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) loci (i.e., CSF1PO, D2S1338, D3S1358, D5S818, D6S1043, D7S820, D8S1179, D12S391, D13S317, D16S539, D18S51, D19S433, D21S11, FGA, Penta E, TPOX, TH01, vWA), 14 widely used Y chromosome STR (Y-STR) loci (Y_GATA_H4, DYS385a/b, DYS389I/II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS438, DYS439, DYS456, DYS458, DYS635), and amelogenin. This multiplex system was designed for the simultaneous analysis of amelogenin-Yallele mutation, single-source searches, kinship (including familial searching), mixture profiles, international data sharing, and other forensic applications. In this study, the multiplex system was validated for sensitivity, specificity, DNA mixtures, stability, precision, stutter, reproducibility, parallel tests, PCR-based conditions, and population analysis according to the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) developmental validation guidelines. A total of 212 alleles were detected for the 18 autosomal STR loci among 528 Guangdong Han individuals, and 431 haplotypes were found for 14 Y-STRs among 452 unrelated males. The combined match probability (CMP) of the HG19+14Y System was calculated as 2.39 x 10(-29). All the validation results showed that the HG19+14Y System would be a robust, reliable, highly polymorphic, and informative forensic kit.	6.4
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder,, is characterized by the accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides, which consequently affects cognitive decline and memory impairment. Current research on AD treatment is actively focusing on the prevention of neurotoxic A beta peptide accumulation. Monsonia angustifolia is reported to be consumed as an indigenous vegetable in Tanzania. In this study, we investigated the effect of the ethanol (EtOH) extract of M. angustifolia dried ground material on A beta production and spatial learning ability as protection against AD. The formation of A beta peptides was significantly reduced in HeLa cells stably transfected with the Swedish mutant form of,beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) after treatment with a 60% EtOH extract of M. angustifolia. We next examined the cognitive-improving effects of the EtOH extract in vivo. Tg2576 mice were treated with extract for 6 months and subjected to Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. The results showed that the 60% EtOH extract of M. angustifolia significantly ameliorated behavioral deficits of the AD transgenic mice and reduced the level of insoluble A beta 42 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. We further found that the 60% EtOH extract was effective for memory function recovery after shorter treatment (4 months). In addition, we isolated and identified several single compounds, justicidin A, 5-methoxyjusticidin A, chinensinaphthol, retrochinensinaphthol methyl ether, and suchilactone, from M. angustifolia and tested these compounds. Among them, justicidin A potently decreased the formation of A beta in APPsw-transfected cells. These data suggest that the 60% EtOH extract of M. angustifolia has the potential to be developed as a treatment of AD. Furthermore, justicidin A may contribute, at least partially, to the A beta alteration observed with the extract treatment.	5.2
Infants become increasingly helpful during the second year. We investigated experimentally whether adults' explicit scaffolding influences this development. Infants (N = 69, 13-18 months old) participated in a series of simple helping tasks. Half of infants received explicit scaffolding (encouragement and praise), whereas the other half did not. Among younger infants (below 15 months), infants who received explicit scaffolding helped twice as often as infants in the control group, and also helped more on several subsequent trials when no scaffolding was provided. As predicted, older infants were not affected by explicit scaffolding. These results demonstrate the influence of social experiences in early helping, but also how the effects of scaffolding may depend on the developmental level of the child. Less explicit forms of scaffolding may be effective when children are older.	2.4
Rock-detention structures are used as restoration treatments to engineer ephemeral stream channels of southeast Arizona, USA, to reduce streamflow velocity, limit erosion, retain sediment, and promote surface-water infiltration. Structures are intended to aggrade incised stream channels, yet little quantified evidence of efficacy is available. The goal of this 3-year study was to characterize the geomorphic impacts of rock-detention structures used as a restoration strategy and develop a methodology to predict the associated changes. We studied reaches of two ephemeral streams with different watershed management histories: one where thousands of loose-rock check dams were installed 30 years prior to our study, and one with structures constructed at the beginning of our study. The methods used included runoff, sediment transport, and geomorphic modelling and repeat terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) surveys to map landscape change. Where discharge data were not available, event-based runoff was estimated using KINEROS2, a one-dimensional kinematic-wave runoff and erosion model. Discharge measurements and estimates were used as input to a two-dimensional unsteady flow-and-sedimentation model (Nays2DH) that combined a gridded flow, transport, and bed and bank simulation with geomorphic change. Through comparison of consecutive DEMs, the potential to substitute uncalibrated models to analyze stream restoration is introduced. We demonstrate a new approach to assess hydraulics and associated patterns of aggradation and degradation resulting from the construction of check-dams and other transverse structures. Notably, we find that stream restoration using rock-detention structures is effective across vastly different timescales. Published by Elsevier B.V.	3.1
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation has been implicated in many common complex diseases, but inconsistent and contradicting results are common. Here we introduce a novel mutational load hypothesis, which also considers the collective effect of mainly rare variants, utilising the MutPred Program. We apply this new methodology to investigate the possible role of mtDNA in two cardiovascular disease (CVD) phenotypes (hypertension and hyperglycaemia), within a two-population cohort (n = 363; mean age 45 +/- 9 yrs). Very few studies have looked at African mtDNA variation in the context of complex disease, and none using complete sequence data in a well-phenotyped cohort. As such, our study will also extend our knowledge of African mtDNA variation, with complete sequences of Southern Africans being especially under-represented. The cohort showed prevalence rates for hypertension (58.6%) and prediabetes (44.8%). We could not identify a statistically significant role for mtDNA variation in association with hypertension or hyperglycaemia in our cohort. However, we are of the opinion that the method described will find wide application in the field, being especially useful for cohorts from multiple locations or with a variety of mtDNA lineages, where the traditional haplogroup association method has been particularly likely to generate spurious results in the context of association with common complex disease.

Recently, skin detection has been employed in multifarious applications of computer vision including face detection, gesture recognition, etc. This is mainly due to the appealing characteristics of skin color and its potency to segment objects. However, there are certain challenges involved in utilizing human complexion as a feature to detect faces, and they have led to the inefficiency of many methods. In order to counteract these factors, in this paper, a skin segmentation method which exploits a multi step diffusion algorithm to detect skin regions is presented. The method starts with conservative extraction of skin seeds in each frame which is accomplished by using fusion of ternary-based human motion detection, modified Bayesian classifier, and a feedback mechanism. Subsequently, these candidate skin pixels are utilized in a 2-stage diffusion scheme to detect other skin pixels. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in comparison with other works.	0.0
The current study explored the relationships between declarative pointing and theory of mind abilities in 30 children between 3 and 4years of age. Measures used to examine theory of mind (ToM) included a parental questionnaire and the Scaling of Theory of Mind Tasks. Results showed a dissociation between expressive and informative pointing, which have been regarded as two subcategories of the declarative function. ToM abilities were significantly related to the production of informative pointing, but not to the production of expressive pointing. This distinction might be explained by special features associated with informative pointing, such as early signs of cooperation abilities. Our results might have key implications for psychologists, as they may help improve evaluation and intervention programs for the development of social skills in preschoolers.	2.4
This paper describes how an inerter-based device for structural vibration suppression can be realized using an electromagnetic transducer such as a linear motor. When the motor shaft moves, a difference of voltage is generated across the transducer coil. The voltage difference is proportional to the relative velocity between its two terminals. The electromagnetic transducer will exert a force proportional to current following the Lorentz principle if the circuit is closed around the transducer coil. If an electronic circuit consisting of a capacitor, an inductance and a resistance with the appropriate configuration is connected, the resulting force reflected back into the mechanical domain is equivalent to that achieved by a mechanical inerter-based device. The proposed configuration is easy to implement and very versatile, provided a high quality conversion system with negligible losses. With the use of electromagnetic devices, a new generation of vibration absorbers can be realized, for example in the electrical domain it would be relatively uncomplicated to synthesize multi-frequency or real time tunable vibration absorbers by adding electrical components in parallel. In addition by using resistance emulators in the electrical circuits, part of the absorbed vibration energy can be converted into usable power. Here an electromagnetic tuned inerter damper (E-TID) is tested experimentally using real time dynamic substructuring. A voltage compensation unit was developed in order to compensate for coil losses. This voltage compensation unit requires power, which is acquired through harvesting from the vibration energy using a resistance emulator. A power balance analysis was developed in order to ensure the device can be self sufficient. Promising experimental results, using this approach, have been obtained and are presented in this paper. The ultimate goal of this research is the development of autonomous electromagnetic vibration absorbers, able to harvest energy, convert it into usable power, and use it for vibration control and health monitoring.	1.2
The present study compared the course of parent-report and actigraphy-derived sleep profiles over a 1-year period, in school-age children with autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire and 14 nights of actigraphy were used to assess sleep profiles. Parents also completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, the Social Worries Questionnaire and the Bedtime Routines Questionnaire. Between-group differences in parent-reported sleep problems were less pronounced at follow-up compared to baseline. The course of objective sleep was comparable between groups, with a significant reduction in sleep duration over time in both groups. Children with autism spectrum disorder were further characterised by significantly more night-to-night variability in sleep quality, across both time points. Reductions over time in parent-reported sleep problems were significantly associated with reduced anxiety. Reductions in actigraphy-derived sleep efficiency were associated with an increased frequency of maladaptive activities in the hour before bedtime, in both children with and without autism spectrum disorder.	5.4
University studies have changed in Spain in the last five years in order to adequate them to the European Space for Higher Education. Under these changes Spanish law fixes the skills and abilities that must acquire the Graduates in Engineering with competences and applications in the Industrial Field. Among them, it can be found the corresponding to Manufacturing Engineering. In this work an Integrated Lab-Practical Class has been performed including different stages of a Manufacturing Process from the Product/Process Design to the Final Product. This Practical Class is developed in six sessions. This experience has shown the interest of the students for the contents of the subject and its relationship with the theoretical concepts.	3.2
B-group vitamins play an important role in human metabolism, whose deficiencies are associated with a variety of disorders and diseases. Certain microorganisms such as Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been shown to have capacities for B-group vitamin production and thus could potentially replace chemically synthesized vitamins for food fortification. A potential probiotic strain named Lactobacillus plantarum LZ227, which was isolated from raw cow milk in this study, exhibits the ability to produce B-group vitamins. Complete genome sequencing of LZ227 was performed to gain insights into the genetic elements involved in B-group vitamin production. The genome of LZ227 contains a circular 3,131,750-bp chromosome, three circular plasmids and two predicted linear plasmids. LZ227 also contains gene clusters for biosynthesis of both riboflavin and folate. This genome sequence provides a basis for further elucidation of its molecular genetics and probiotic functions, and will facilitate its applications as starter cultures in food industry.

Advanced design and operation consideration for the close-connected winding permanent-magnet brushless DC machine is proposed in this paper, including circulating current elimination, fault-tolerant control for the breakdown of a power electronic switch, and a sensorless control method. With the finite-element analysis, the influence of machine design parameters on circulating current is investigated. By properly controlling the status of power electronic switches, the coils being connected into the equivalent circuit can be changed to avoid the failure switch. Sensorless control is explored by detecting the zero-crossing point of electromotive force.	3.3
Chemotaxis, the microorganisms autonomous motility along or against the concentration gradients of a chemical species, is an important, yet often neglected factor controlling the transport of bacteria through saturated porous media. For example, chemotactic bacteria could enhance bioremediation by directing their own motion to residual contaminants trapped in low hydraulic conductive zones of contaminated aquifers. The aim of the present work is to develop an accurate numerical scheme to model chemotaxis in saturated porous media and other advective dominating flow systems. We propose to model chemotaxis by using a new class of meshless Lagrangian particle methods we recently developed for applications in fluid mechanics. The method is based on the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation of (Ben Moussa et al., Int Ser Numer Math, 13(1):29-62, 2006), combined with a new Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction technique on moving point clouds in multiple space dimensions. The purpose of this new numerical scheme is to fully exploit the advantages of SPH among traditional mesh-based and mesh-free schemes and to overcome drawbacks related to the use of standard SPH for modeling chemotaxis in porous media. First, we test the new scheme against analytical reference solutions. Then, under the assumption of complete mixing at the Darcy scale, we perform two-dimensional conservative solute transport simulations under steady-state flow conditions, to show the capability of the proposed new scheme to model chemotaxis.	3.4
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging network paradigm that aims to obtain the interactions among pervasive things through heterogeneous networks. Security is an important task in the IoT. Luo et al. (Secur Commun Netw 7(10): 1560-1569, 2014) proposed a certificateless online/offline signcryption (COOSC) scheme for the IoT (hereafter called LTX). Unfortunately, Shi et al. showed that LTX is not secure. An adversary can easily obtain the private key of a user by a ciphertext. Recently, Li et al. proposed a new COOSC scheme (hereafter called LZZ). However, both LTX and LZZ need a point multiplication operation in the online phase, which is not suitable for resource-constrained devices. To overcome this weakness, we propose a new COOSC scheme and prove its security in the random oracle model. In addition, we analyze the performance of our scheme and show its application in the IoT.	0.3
This paper presents a systematic, socio-technical and empirical evaluation of the actual energy and environmental performance of a sustainably-designed institutional building (Southeast England), intended to be a teaching tool and 'living laboratory' of sustainability. Despite the building being designed to high sustainability standards (Energy Performance Certificate rating of A, low reliance on fossil fuels, natural ventilation and rainwater harvesting) and also being under-utilised during the in-use stage (lower hours of occupation and number of occupants), its actual energy-related carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions are four times more than predicted. This is due to poor energy management of the building, underperformance of the biomass boiler and wasteful energy practices in terms of excessive winter overheating in the atrium, inappropriate lighting controls, and electrical equipment being left on standby. Due to lack of training and understanding of the energy manager, the building management system was not used adequately and issues with installation, commissioning and maintenance of the biomass boiler led to its disuse; however the photovoltaic system generated electricity as expected. Findings from the study show how a mixed-methods approach of building performance evaluation (BPE) should be embedded as part of the build process, to ensure that performance outcomes are met in reality.

Narcissism can lead to various interpersonal problems. However, the characteristics of social decision making in trait narcissism and the cognitive and affective underpinnings are poorly understood. We employed established game theoretical paradigms to investigate different facets of social behavior in participants (N = 122; 41 female, mean age = 30 years) with a wide range of scores on the Pathological Narcissistic Inventory. Interpersonal traits, attitudes, and emotions were assessed as potential mediators of behavioral differences. High narcissism scores were related to lower generosity, especially when this could result in being punished. This maladaptive behavior was fully mediated by reduced perspective-taking abilities in narcissism. Also, narcissism scores predicted higher levels of punishment behavior, driven by higher levels of experienced anger. Hence, the difficulties narcissists face in interactions may be due to their reduced perspective-taking skills and resulting reduced generosity as well as enhanced anger-based retaliation behavior.

An approach-avoidance model of social withdrawal (Asendorpf, 1990) identifies 3 types of social withdrawal including shyness, unsociability, and avoidance. Each appears to be uniquely associated with varying indicators of maladjustment in emerging adulthood (Nelson, 2013) but little, if any, work has been done to see how they might be linked to media use in the third decade of life. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine longitudinally the links between subtypes of social withdrawal, connective media (e.g., e-mail, social networking) and problematic (forms of media such as violent video games that, when used in high amounts, have been found to be linked to indices of maladjustment) media use, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The participants in the study (M-age = 20.70, SD = 1.98, range = 18-29 at Time 2) consisted of 204 undergraduate students (58% female) recruited from 2 large public universities in the United States who completed questionnaires at 2 points of time separated by 1 year. Results revealed that avoidant individuals use problematic forms of media more than average, unsociable, and shy individuals. Furthermore, problematic media use predicted more withdrawn behavior at Time 2 and mediated the relation between avoidance and externalizing behaviors over time. Few problems were found for unsociable behavior. The need to differentiate between multiple forms of withdrawal in emerging adulthood and their links with problematic forms of media and subsequent risk factors is discussed.	2.4
This study focuses on examining the behavioral component of the third-person effect. It explores the self-other perceptual gap concerning the influence of nuclear pollution news on the prediction of different actions: corrective, protective, and promotional. The study analyzes data from a probability sample collected in Taiwan after the news about nuclear pollution from Fukushima was widely reported. The results showed that the discrepancy in self-other perceptions was a significant predictor of multiple behavioral intentions, which included seeking self-protection (e.g., taking iodide pills), supporting corrective actions (e.g., opposing the building of new nuclear power plants), and supporting government-led promotional measures (e.g., launching public educational campaigns on nuclear safety). These results indicate that the behavioral component of the third-person effect extends beyond the realm of willingness to censor.	2.2
The dc power feeding system has been attracted attention in recent years. Since the load is dynamically changed in this system, the stability of dc-dc converter is important. This paper presents the stability analysis and the transient response of digital integral gain changeable control dc-dc converter using small output capacitance. The proposed method changes the integral gain with a single logarithm function according to the load current. It is verified the proposed method can obtain a good transient response with high stability even when the output capacitance is small.	1.4
OBJECTIVE: To determine RDW and MPV levels in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and to investigate their relations with disease activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 133 patients with AS (male: 80, female: 53) and age-sex matched 133 controls (male: 79, female: 54) were enrolled. Demographic data, disease activity scores, Complete Blood Count (CBC), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels were recorded. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients and controls were 41.9 +/- 11.2 and 39.7 +/- 14.2 years respectively (p = 0.16). RDW (14.5 +/- 1.6% and 13.2 +/- 0.8%, p4) and those with inactive AS (BASDI < 4) patients (14.84 +/- 1.79fl, 14.24 +/- 1.37fl, p = 0.035 respectively). RDW was positively correlated with BASDAI (r = 0.33, P < 0.0001), ESR (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) and CRP (r = 0.42, P < 0.0001) and PLT levels (r = 0.24, P = 0.004). While MPV was not correlated with BASDAI, it was negatively correlated with ESR (r = -0.19, P = 0.03), CPR (r = -0.26, P = 0.004) and PLT levels (r = -0.39, P = < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: RDW and MPV were significantly higher in the patients with AS than in the controls. While RDW was correlated with BASDAI and APRs, MPV was only correlated with APRs.	5.3
Background: There is widespread consensus on the importance of safe and secure communication in healthcare, especially in trauma care where time is a limiting factor. Although non-verbal communication has an impact on communication between individuals, there is only limited knowledge of how trauma team leaders communicate. The purpose of this study was to investigate how trauma team members are positioned in the emergency room, and how leaders communicate in terms of gaze direction, vocal nuances, and gestures during trauma team training. Methods: Eighteen trauma teams were audio and video recorded during trauma team training in the emergency department of a hospital in northern Sweden. Quantitative content analysis was used to categorize the team members' positions and the leaders' non-verbal communication: gaze direction, vocal nuances, and gestures. The quantitative data were interpreted in relation to the specific context. Time sequences of the leaders' gaze direction, speech time, and gestures were identified separately and registered as time (seconds) and proportions (%) of the total training time. Results: The team leaders who gained control over the most important area in the emergency room, the inner circle, positioned themselves as heads over the team, using gaze direction, gestures, vocal nuances, and verbal commands that solidified their verbal message. Changes in position required both attention and collaboration. Leaders who spoke in a hesitant voice, or were silent, expressed ambiguity in their non-verbal communication: and other team members took over the leader's tasks. Discussion: In teams where the leader had control over the inner circle, the members seemed to have an awareness of each other's roles and tasks, knowing when in time and where in space these tasks needed to be executed. Deviations in the leaders' communication increased the ambiguity in the communication, which had consequences for the teamwork. Communication cannot be taken for granted; it needs to be practiced regularly just as technical skills need to be trained. Simulation training provides healthcare professionals the opportunity to put both verbal and nonverbal communication in focus, in order to improve patient safety. Conclusions: Non-verbal communication plays a decisive role in the interaction between the trauma team members, and so both verbal and non-verbal communication should be in focus in trauma team training. This is even more important for inexperienced leaders, since vague non-verbal communication reinforces ambiguity and can lead to errors.	2.3
A host of mining practices produce fine-grained mineral sludge, such as mature fine tailing from oil-sand extraction. These sludges are hard to dewater because of their high clay content and their low hydraulic conductivity. This paper describes pressure filtration tests in which eight different nonwoven geotextiles (GTXs) were used to filter high-clay-content sludges. The sludges were formulated by mixing kaolinite and silt to obtain eight different grain-size distributions (GSDs) with d(50) ranging from 3 to 55 mu m and clay content ranging from 0% to 38% (d < 2 mu m). The sludges created for this research had the GSD and variability of real fine tailings. The results indicate that sludges can be filtered with nonwoven GTXs selected on the basis of their pore-opening size. Furthermore, calendered GTXs are more efficient in retaining particles than needle punched GTXs. In addition, only during the early stage of filtration do GTXs really influence filtering because it is at this stage that, by retaining coarser particles, they allow progressive formation of filter cake. Upon forming, the filter cake becomes the major contributor to particle retention. Finally, the sludge composition is found to be the most significant factor affecting the final state of dewatering.

To evaluate the controlling factors for coastline change of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary since 1974, we extracted the mean high tide line from multi -temporal remote sensing images that span from 1974 to 2014 at 2 year intervals. We chose 42 scenes to constrain the changing pattern of the Changjiang Estuary coastline, and implemented GIS technology to analyze the area change of the Changjiang (Yangtze) Subaerial Delta. Runoff, sediment discharge and coastal engineering were withal considered in the analysis of the coastline changes. The coastline has transgressed seaward since 1974, and a part of it presents inter -annual variations. The area of the Changjiang Subaerial Delta increased by 871 km(2), with a net accretion rate of 21.8 km(2)/a. Based on the change of sediment discharge due to the major projects in the Changjiang River Basin, we divided the changing pattern of the coastline into three stages: the slow accretion stage (1974-1986), the moderate accretion stage (1987-2002), and the rapid accretion stage (2003-2014). Liner regression analysis illustrated that there is a significantly positive correlation between the area changes and sediment discharge in the Chongming Eastern Shoal and Jiuduansha. This suggested that sediment load has a fundamental effect on the evolution of the Changjiang Estuary. Construction of Deep Waterway in the North Passage of the Changjiang River (1998-2010) led to a rapid accretion in the Hengsha Eastern Shoal and Jiuduansha by influencing the hydrodynamics in North Passage. Coastal engineering such as reclamation and harbor construction can also change the morphology of the Changjiang Estuary. We defined a contribution rate of area change to assess the impact of reclamation on the evolution of Changjiang Estuary. It turned out that more than 45.3% of area increment of the Changjiang Estuary was attributed to reclamation.	4.2
One of the most prominent fine-structures of auroral hiss is the long-hissler, defined here as a dispersed feature embedded within broadband auroral hiss emissions in the frequency range 1-40 kHz and lasting longer than 0.3 s. While theory is limited, there is evidence that hisslers can be used in remote sensing of density characteristics at altitudes of thousands of km. By applying an automatic threshold algorithm to VLF data collected at South Pole 2230-0130 UT daily during June-August 2014, 22 h of auroral hiss are identified on 49 of 93 days analyzed, for an occurrence rate of 9.7% during the applicable MLT interval. From manual inspection of these intervals, 414 groups (trains) of long hisslers are identified on 34 of the 49 days on which hiss occurred. Median lower (upper) frequency bounds of these features are 8 (22) kHz, median frequency-time slope is -10 kHz/s, and median hissler repetition time within a train (hissler period) is 1.2 s. Hissler period and frequency-time slope are inversely related. Data from previous studies are reviewed to provide a comprehensive description of the phenomenon. Contrary to some previous studies, subsequent long hissler features are found to commonly overlap in time, and no evidence is found for an inverse relationship between hissler train duration and geomagnetic activity.	4.2
The aim of this paper is to present a model that takes into account aspects related to manufacturing engineering in research and development projects. The proposed model integrates the tools of DFMA (Design for Manufacturing and Assembly) and MRL (Manufacturing Readiness Level).Design for Manufacturing and Assembly is used as a method to provide guidance to the design team in simplifying the product structure, to reduce manufacturing and assembly costs, and to quantify improvements. Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) is a measure to assess the maturity of manufacturing readiness, similar to how Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are used for technology readiness. The proposed method was applied in a research and development project at a refrigeration industry, in its technology definition phase. The results were a significant change in product design, bringing benefits as reduction of investment and product cost by 25% and 20%. Is also possible perceive that the anticipation of the manufacturing project, when working simultaneously with the technology maturation is allowing the most reliable debugging at a product, permitting a reduction in the lead time.	3.2
A good task design improve the efficiency of the business, because reduces cost and helps you to analysis the risk classification, and permit manager the influence of human and organizational factors of the complexity of socio-technical systems. A discussion is held on the techniques proposed by Embrey, Lees, Hollnagel, Reason, Rasmussen and Avila dealing with the task of project subject and its forms of control. Understanding the complexity of production systems enables the development of suitable tools to prevent accidents and to mitigate their consequences. The task performance depends on cognitive and organizational requirements beyond the technical: (a) organizational climate for transparency in the reporting of incidents; (b) managerial profile to communicate routine operating and emergency; (c) indicators for decision-making on the task; (d) sufficient knowledge base for the team accomplish the task; (e) communication tools for the production shift and return the view for the staff; (f) trust, cooperation, understanding of the risks and the causal relationship of events to perform the task; (g) understanding of the work patterns and the resulting on the performance indicators in the control of production; and (h) the appropriate design technology, process and equipment to allow review on the man-machine interface or man procedure. David Embrey discusses the Hierarchical Task Analysis HTA and presents criteria from the risk and complexity of the task. Lees presents discussion on the need of the side project of machine and man presenting cognitive requirements for machine design and machine operating requirements for human knowledge. Rasmussen and Reason discuss level of knowledge, understanding of the rules and skills needed to perform the task. Holnagel presents a way to plan the task with the analysis of goals, steps and commitments. Avila discusses the technology, the complexity of the task, the risk environments, barriers, tooling, pattern, knowledge and commitment and propose Procedures and Standards (PADOP), considering the analysis of the critical task by quantifying efforts, level of parallelism in its realization, the discussion on acceptance level based on target performance indicators and their measurement to suggest changes. An exercise is developed based on operational control practice in the chemical industry sulfuric acid purification. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	3.3
Acetone is a good marker of metabolic stress as it is the most volatile and rapidly equilibrated of the ketone bodies produced by human metabolism. If the body utilizes predominately fat to meet its energy requirements, blood and breath acetone concentrations will increase. Elevated concentrations of breath acetone can indicate a normal response to caloric imbalances in the diet, or a diseased state such as untreated diabetes. This paper describes a novel method of acetone detection that uses a gas-solid chemical reaction of acetone with a hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HA) to produce an easily detectable chemical species, HCl. Breath samples are passed through a reactor filled with solid HA and the amount of HCl gas released is measured by sensitive near infrared diode laser spectroscopy. The breath acetone instrument described is compact, low power and portable.	6.2
The compliance of increasing requirements on the final product often constitutes a challenge in manufacturing of metal parts. The common problem represents the precise reproduction of geometrical form. The reasons for form deviation can be e. g. varying properties of the semi-finished product as well as wear of the punch-bending machine or the punch-bending tool themself. Usually the process parameters are manually adjusted on the introduction of new production scenario or after the deviation between the actual form of produced pieces and the designed form become clear. The choice of new process parameters is normally based on the experience of the machine operators. It leads to a time-consuming and expensive procedure right on the early stages of production scenarios as well as during the established production process. Furthermore, the trend of miniaturization of part sizes along with narrowing tolerances and increase in the strengths of materials drastically pushes up the requirements on the production process. Aiming at reduction of scrap rate and setup-time of production scenarios, a model-based approach is chosen to design a self-correcting control strategy. The strategy is designed by modeling the bending process. In the first step the bending process has to be analyzed on the model by varying of process variables influencing the process significantly. It is done by corresponding simulations. After that, the correlations between significant variables and geometrical deviation were defined and different self-correcting control strategies were designed and tested. In order to identify and validate the simulation and to test the quality of the self-correcting control strategies, a special experimental tool was built up. The experimental tool is equipped with an additional measurement device and can be operated on a universal testing machine. Finally, the self-correcting control strategies were tested under real production conditions on the original tool in order to address further influences of the punch-bending machine on the manufacturing process.	3.2
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by many cell types in both normal and pathogenic circumstances. Because EVs, particularly exosomes, are known to transfer biologically active proteins, RNAs and lipids between cells, they have recently become the focus of intense interest as potential mediators of cell-cell communication, particularly in long-range and juxtacrine signaling events associated with adaptive immune function and progression of cancer. Among the EVs, exosomes appear particularly adapted for long-range delivery of cargoes between cells. Because of their association with disease states, the exciting potential for exosomes to serve as diagnostic biomarkers and as target-specific biomolecule delivery vehicles has stimulated a broad range of biomedical investigations to learn how exosomes are generated, what their cargoes are, and how they might be tailored for uptake by remote targets. Addressing these questions requires experimental models in which biochemically useful amounts of material can be harvested, gene expression easily manipulated, and interpretable biological assays developed. The early Xenopus embryo fulfills these model-system ideals in an in vivo context: during morphogenesis the embryo develops several large, fluid-filled extracellular compartments across which numerous tissue-specifying signals must cross, and which are abundantly endowed with exosomes and other EVs. Importantly, certain surface-facing tissues avidly ingest EVs during gastrulation. Recent work has demonstrated that EVs can be isolated from these interstitial spaces in amounts suitable for proteomic and transcriptomic analysis. With its large numbers, great cell size, well-understood fate map, and tolerance of a variety of experimental approaches, the Xenopus embryo provides a unique opportunity to both understand and manipulate the basic cell biology of exosomal trafficking in the context of an intact organism.	6.1
Objective: To evaluate the role of auto-antibodies in Chinese patients with primary and secondary infertility in routine clinical practice. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of infertile Chinese patients of either gender (>= 18 year old) who were failed to conceive after 12 months of regular sexual intercourse without the use of contraception, and visited at department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China between January 2004 to December 2014, and undergone auto-antibody estimation along with other routine antenatal screening tests. Immunological assay was performed using dot immuno-gold filtration assay. Positive case was compared among patients with primary and secondary infertility. Results: Our chart review study showed that the positive case of Anti-Sperm Antibody (ASAb) was significantly higher in female with primary than male (p<0.05). In female patients with primary infertility, all other auto-antibodies (anti-Endometrium Antibody (EMAb), Anti-Ovary Antibody (AOAb), Anti-Zona Pellucida Antibody (AZP)) and Anti-Cardiolipin Antibody (ACA) were significantly higher compared to patients with secondary infertility (p<0.05). Moreover, positive case of all auto-antibodies was significantly higher among female with primary fertility than secondary fertility and control groups. Conclusion: Our study results suggested the involvement of auto-antibodies related to reproduction system in development of primary infertility. Auto-antibodies related to reproduction were significantly higher in patients with primary infertility, this implicated involvement of auto-immunological factors in development of infertility.	6.3
Oral food challenges are essential in diagnosing food allergies correctly. However, the decision to proceed to oral food challenge is complex and influenced by different factors. The procedures have to be conducted by allergy specialized centers and require careful preparation. Besides being performed double-blind and placebo-controlled the blinding of the food is challenging and limited by the amount and type of food. The interpretation of the results of the challenge are important. Not only the positive but also the negative results have to be discussed with the patients. Dietary implications of food avoid-ance and re-introduction should be provided desirably by a dietician.	5.1
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease, but treatment options for moderate-to-severe disease are limited. Ustekinumab is an IL-12/IL-23p40 antagonist that suppresses Th1, Th17 and Th22 activation, commonly used for psoriasis patients. We sought to assess efficacy and safety of ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In this phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 33 patients with moderate-to-severe AD were randomly assigned to either ustekinumab (n=16) or placebo (n=17), with subsequent crossover at 16 weeks, and last dose at 32 weeks. Background therapy with mild topical steroids was allowed to promote retention. Study endpoints included clinical (SCORAD50) and biopsy-based measures of tissue structure and inflammation, using protein and gene expression studies. The ustekinumab group achieved higher SCORAD50 responses at 12, 16 ( the primary endpoint) and 20 weeks compared to placebo, but the difference between groups was not significant. The AD molecular profile/transcriptome showed early robust gene modulation, with sustained further improvements until 32 weeks in the initial ustekinumab group. Distinct and more robust modulation of Th1, Th17 and Th22 but also Th2-related AD genes was seen after 4 weeks of ustekinumab treatment (i.e. MMP12, IL-22, IL-13, IFN-gamma, elafin/PI3, CXCL1 and CCL17; P<. 05). Epidermal responses (K16, terminal differentiation) showed faster (4 weeks) and long-term regulation (32 weeks) from baseline in the ustekinumab group. No severe adverse events were observed. Ustekinumab had clear clinical and molecular effects, but clinical outcomes might have been obscured by a profound placebo effect, most likely due to background topical glucocorticosteroids and possibly insufficient dosing for AD.	6.3
The Multi Objective Genetic Algorithms (MO-GAs) are one of the most widely used techniques that have the capability to find the solution to the problem having multiple conflicting objectives like Intrusion De- tection. It is a population based technique capable of producing a set of non-inferior solutions that exhibit the classification trade-offs for the user. This capabil- ity of MOGA can be exploited for generating optimal base classifiers and ensembles thereof for Intrusion De- tection. This paper explores the various MOGAs proposed in the literature along with their pros and cons. The motivation for the use of MOGA and its issues are high- lighted. Finally, the chapter highlights the concluding remarks.	0.2
Location-aware service systems are a hot topic in diverse research fields including mobile commerce, ambient intelligence, remote sensing and ubiquitous computing. However, the timeliness and efficiency of such systems are two issues that have rarely been emphasized. For this reason, this study tries to establish a location-aware service system in which both the timeliness and efficiency of service provision are addressed. To this end, some innovative treatments have been used in the proposed methodology. First, the uncertainty of detecting a user's location using the global positioning system is considered by modeling the location and speed of the user with fuzzy numbers. Subsequently, a fuzzy integer-nonlinear programming model is formulated to address the problem of finding the dynamic just-in-time service location and path for the user. To help solve the problem, the maximum entropy weighting function and the basic defuzzification distribution (BADD) method are applied to defuzzify the fuzzy variables. In addition, to enhance the efficiency of solving the problem, a fuzzy parallel processing scheme is also proposed for decomposing the problem into smaller pieces that can be handled by separate processing modules. An illustrative example is used to illustrate the proposed methodology. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been confirmed with an experiment. According to the results, using the proposed methodology the waiting time could be reduced by 60%.	4.0
The aim of this study was to compare the concentration of salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and the selected interleukins (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in young individuals with presence and non-presence of Lactobacillus reuteri in saliva after a three-week intervention with probiotic lozenges. The study group consisted of 47 healthy individuals aged 18-32 years with no clinical signs of oral inflammation. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial participants ingested two lozenges per day containing two strains of the probiotic bacterium L. reuteri or placebo lozenges. The intervention and wash-out periods were three weeks. Stimulated and unstimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and immediately after termination of the intervention periods. The samples were analysed for total protein, salivary IgA and selected cytokines. In this extended analysis, data were collected by analysing baseline and follow-up saliva samples related to ingestion of the probiotic lozenges for the presence of L. reuteri through DNA-extraction, PCR-amplification and gel-electrophoresis. At baseline, 27% of the individuals displayed presence of L. reuteri and 42% were positive immediately after the three-week probiotic intervention. Individuals with presence of L. reuteri in saliva had significantly higher (P<0.05) concentrations of salivary IgA and %IgA/protein at the termination of the probiotic intake compared with non-presence. No differences in the cytokine levels were observed. In conclusion, detectable levels of L. reuteri in saliva coincided with higher concentrations of salivary IgA and %IgA/protein in stimulated whole saliva after the three-week daily intake of probiotic lozenges. Our findings suggest that monitoring the presence of probiotic candidates in the oral environment is important to interpret and understand their possible immune-modulating role in maintaining oral health.	6.3

Problem. - Neurobiology, adorned with the most recent discoveries of the molecular biology, the genetics and the cognitive sciences, is present everywhere: In the report of the man with his body, with his intellectual faculties, with his perception of others and himself. Our social conducts, morality and our affects would be governed by neuronal substrata. Are things so simple? Methodology. - To try to answer this question, the author is going to use the opposition to explain and understand, in a long-standing and often passionate debate which concerns the epistemology and the ontology, two modalities to be inflexible. Different thus of methods: In the mind of Dilthey, we explain the nature (submitted to the principle of the causality) but we understand the psychic life (which sends back to the sphere of the sense). Results. - If the debate to explain and understand is further and far from being simple, the author adduces to draw from it some conclusions by questioning the speech of the promising of a reductionist neurobiology which believe to explain everything including all our actions in the name of the neurobiological reason: (1) if this is the case, we would be slaves of a history which already has its fate: The neurobiological-shaped man is neurobiological, (2) this speech is based on the mechanism of the tautology, that is it goes round in circles, teaches us absolutely nothing, (3) if the same neurobiologist asserts the opposite, why while reporting me what I say, I have no precise and localizable perception of my consciousness? (4) if the consciousness has no appropriate place or, to say it differently, if there is no intellectual topic appropriate to the consciousness, then what takes place in me will remain forever untranslatable and will be condemned to the silence. To go out of one, exist thus, I need the immediate and permanent help of an other one (or of contradiction), (5) if this process is purely an event of the brain then all our actions, all our gestures, in brief all that it is allowed us to live has to take place as it takes place, (6) finally to assert it brings us nothing more because the explanation always leaves something aside: the phenomenon of the life in which he is imperceptible. The example of the alcoholic is significant: if a change of the intellectual mechanisms is responsible of his alcohol addiction, why the alcoholic, by wanting to drink how everybody, makes as if written history beforehand was of not much importance? If the alcoholic began thinking of his own cerebral dysfunction while he lives, his life would have no shape. Indeed, if he receives the message and knows the felling about which it is a question. Indeed, if he receives the message and knows the feeling about which it is a question, he cannot, by force of circumstance, feel what his brain passes on to him: he does not witness what appears in its brain. On the other and he witnesses the world in which he lives but also on his condition of mortal. So, without objects to be cultivated, that is without the world of the presence which is the one of the existence and not the understanding, the neurobiological explanation of his alcohol addiction will concern a knowledge but will ignore any life. It means that there is well a gap to live and theorize and that the alcoholic is not reduced to a cerebral dysfunction: he is in the life of relation, that is it is capable of taking up himself by using its real-life experience. The psychopathology implications are going to show themselves here of a very big importance: any reduction comes to truncate the understanding of the man sick coach in reality we constantly have to deal with the global and complete man, with the anthropology of the human fate. Conclusion. - If the science brings us news discovered in this domain, it has to keep always in mind that the life remains imperceptible and deeply moving. Without this existential event which allows us to live, the air will become unbreathable in our more and more technical-scientific world: it would like being sentenced to asphyxiation.

Mesenchymal neoplasms of the thymus and mediastinum account for only 2 % of neoplasms of the mediastinum and are therefore very rare. With very few exceptions the histology, immunohistochemistry and (based on current knowledge) molecular biology of mediastinal soft tissue tumors are not different from their counterparts in other organs. Characteristic features are more concerned with clinical epidemiological and therapeutic aspects as well as the multitude of possible differential diagnoses. With the exception of organ-specific tumors, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), virtually all entities encountered in peripheral soft tissues can also arise in the mediastinum. Primary mediastinal soft tissue sarcomas (STS) must be distinguished from secondary radiation-induced STS after irradiation, e. g. for breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma and from STS arising as somatic type malignancies in mediastinal germ cell tumors.	6.0
Cavitation distribution in a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound sonoreactors (HIFU) has been extensively described in the recent literature, including quantification by an optical method (Sonochemiluminescence SCL). The present paper provides complementary measurements through the study of acoustic streaming generated by the same kind of HIFU transducers. To this end, results of mass transfer measurements (electrodiffusional method) were compared to optical method ones (Particle Image Velocimetry). This last one was used in various configurations: with or without an electrode in the acoustic field in order to have the same perturbation of the wave propagation. Results show that the maximum velocity is not located at the focal but shifted near the transducer, and that this shift is greater for high powers. The two cavitation modes (stationary and moving bubbles) are greatly affect the hydrodynamic behavior of our sonoreactors: acoustic streaming and the fluid generated by bubble motion. The results obtained by electrochemical measurements show the same low hydrodynamic activity in the transducer vicinity, the same shift of the active focal toward the transducer, and the same absence of activity in the post-focal axial zone. The comparison with theoretical Eckart's velocities (acoustic streaming in non-cavitating media) confirms a very high activity at the sonochemical focal, accounted for by wave distortion, which induced greater absorption coefficients. Moreover, the equivalent liquid velocities are one order of magnitude larger than the ones measured by Ply, confirming the enhancement of mass transfer by bubbles oscillation and collapse close to the surface, rather than from a pure streaming effect.

In this paper, a model for single photon amplification based on cluster-state quantum computation is proposed. A rescaling of the probability amplitudes of a deteriorated qubit in favor of the one-photon component will define the amplifier's gain. Unlike the heralded quantum amplifiers, the probabilistic success of the whole process will not depend on the successful detection of a heralding signal. Instead, the whole procedure will rely upon a single-qubit measurement, which is simpler compared to any two-qubit interaction gate in the heralded quantum amplifiers. The proposed model can be used as a qubit protector against propagation losses in long-distance quantum communication networks.	0.3
Redundant nickel is harmful to human health and can result in skin diseases, allergies, or cancer. Although many probes based on noble metal nanoparticles have been established for rapid heavy metal ion detection by the naked eye or ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, few noble metal nanomaterials have been developed for Ni2+ detection. In this study, we propose novel triangular silver nanoprisms (AgNPRs) stabilized with glutathione (GSH) for rapid colorimetric detection of Ni2+ based on a sensing mechanism of anti-etching, which has been affirmed by Raman spectra, UV-vis spectra, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. At the optimal experimental parameters, our GSH-AgNPR-based Ni2+ probe has an excellent selectivity compared with those of 26 other ions because Ni2+ can inhibit the AgNPR etching by iodide ion (11 (i.e., anti-etching) while other ions cannot. The limit of detection (LOD) of our Ni2+ probe is 50 nM via the naked eye and 5 nM via UV-vis spectroscopy. They are both negligible compared with the permissible limit of Ni2+ in drinking water (0.34 mu M) prescribed by the World Health Organization. In particular, the latter is far lower than the LOD values of other reported Ni2+ probes based on noble metal nanomaterials. A satisfying linear relationship reinforces that our probe can be utilized for the quantitative analysis of Ni2+. The detection of real water samples indicates that our probe could be used for rapid Ni2+ colorimetric detection with supersensitivity and excellent selectivity in real environmental water samples.	5.1
Social cognition refers to the ability to use social cues to infer the meaning and intentions behind the behaviour of others in order to respond in a socially adaptive manner. It is increasingly recognised that disorders of social cognition, including problems with emotion perception, theory of mind, conversational inference, morality judgements, decision making and social inhibition, characterise many developmental and psychiatric disorders and are highly relevant to many with acquired brain injuries or diseases, especially the frontotemporal dementias. This review provides an introduction and overview of the papers in this special edition on social cognition and places these in the context of other recent research. In doing so, several current issues in the clinical management of social cognition are delineated. Given that social cognition seems to be a sensitive predictor of psychosocial function, the assessment of social cognition is seen by many clinicians to be important although which profession is responsible is yet to be resolved. Issues in how social cognition are assessed are discussed, including the importance of context to social cognition, its interactive nature and the need to recognise influences such as family upbringing, gender and emotional state on social cognitive performance. There also needs to be development of tests that address all aspects of social cognition, including decision making and inhibition. Finally, this review discusses intervention research. Interventions are especially well developed in relation to schizophrenia, and less well developed in brain injury. These appear to be generally effective although treatments for emotional self-awareness are yet to be developed.	2.1
Background: ZnO-based varistors are used as surge protectors in electrical circuits. Nonlinear polymer composites are attractive because of their potential applications in low voltage varistors. The aim of this research is to study nonlinear behavior in a new composite containing ZnO, polythiophene and polyethylene. Methods: Sample disks consist of 70 wt% ZnO and 30 wt% polymer matrixes were prepared using the hot press method under 20 MPa at 120 degrees C. I-V characteristics of the disks were studied by applying DC voltage. The structure of the products was examined by FESEM and X-ray diffraction. Results: I-V characteristics of the disks show that their resistivity varies nonlinearly under different voltage. By increasing polythiophene content in sample disks, their breakdown voltage decreases whereas nonlinear coefficient increases. On the other hand increasing press temperature has the same effect on the breakdown voltage and nonlinear coefficient. In addition, each increase in working temperature leads to lower breakdown voltage and nonlinear coefficient. Conclusion: Polymer composite containing 70% ZnO-6% polyethylene-24% polythiophene has an appropriate nonlinear behavior. An increase in press temperature enhances nonlinear coefficient and reduces breakdown voltage. FESEM images of the samples show pressing samples at 120 degrees C does not affect composite structure.	1.2
Background and Aim: Prosthetic CAD/CAM systems require accurate 3D limb models; however, difficulties arise when working from the person's socket since current 3D scanners have difficulties scanning socket interiors. While dedicated scanners exist, they are expensive and the cost may be prohibitive for a limited number of scans per year. A low-cost and accessible photogrammetry method for socket interior digitization is proposed, using a smartphone camera and cloud-based photogrammetry services. Technique: 15 two-dimensional images of the socket's interior are captured using a smartphone camera. A 3D model is generated using cloud-based software. Linear measurements were comparing between sockets and the related 3D models. Discussion: 3D reconstruction accuracy averaged 2.6 +/- 2.0 mm and 0.086 +/- 0.078 L, which was less accurate than models obtained by high quality 3D scanners. However, this method would provide a viable 3D digital socket reproduction that is accessible and low-cost, after processing in prosthetic CAD software.	3.0
Rainwater harvesting presents a viable option for securing water availability in order to increase food production. The study focuses on rural youth in Luphisi and Dwaleni villages in the Mpumalanga Province and considers the relationship between youth capabilities and food security. The study uses qualitative data collected from focus group discussions and quantitative data from a baseline survey within the context of an integrated rainwater harvesting project. The indicators tapped into attributes related to trust, social cohesion, inclusion and sociability, and examined these within the context of the 'capability approach', to consider whether and in what ways these attributes can be linked to food security. Results show that youth have high levels of certain capabilities such as trust, social cohesion and inclusion, co-operation, self-esteem, and meaning. However, in other dimensions there are fewer opportunities, like access to networks, access to knowledge and information and sociability, which are lacking among youth and restrict opportunities for them to engage with issues around food and water security. The Chi-square test was used to investigate the relationship between youth capabilities and food security and at p<0.05 results showed that there was no relationship between youth capabilities and food security in Dwaleni. There were however three capabilities showing significant statistical relationships between youth capabilities and food security in Luphisi: collective action and co-operation, social cohesion and self-esteem. We argue that there are opportunities to build on existing capabilities and that, overall, the potential of youth for engaging in water resources management is not being tapped into.	4.3
Context: Therapeutic effects of alpha-L-guluronic acid with the greatest tolerability and efficacy (G2013) have been shown in experimental model of multiple sclerosis and other in vitro and in vivo examinations regarding alpha-L-guluronic acid; there are no toxicological researches on its safety although the pharmacological impacts have been recorded. Objective: This study was designed to determine the acute and sub chronic toxicity of alpha-L-guluronic acid in healthy male and female BALB/c mice. Materials and methods: For the acute toxicity study, the animals orally received five different single doses of alpha-L-guluronic acid and were kept under observation for 14d. In the sub-chronic study, 24 male and female BALB/c mice were divided into four groups and treated daily with test substance preparation at dose levels of 0, 50, 250, and 1250mg/kg body weight for at least 90 consecutive days. The mortality, body weight changes, clinical signs, hematological and biochemical parameters, gross findings, histopathological, and organs weight determinants were monitored during this study. Results: The results of acute toxicity indicated that the LD50 of alpha-L-guluronic acid is 4.8g/kg. We found no mortality or abnormality in clinical signs, body weight, relative organs weight, or necropsy in any of the animals in the subchronic study. Additionally, the results showed no significant difference in hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters in rats. Conclusions: Our results suggest that alpha-L-guluronic acid has high safety when administered orally in animals.	5.3
O-GlcNAcylation is a monosaccharide modification by a residue of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached to serine or threonine moieties on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. O-GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Increasing evidence suggests that O-GlcNAcylation is involved in a variety of human cancers. However, the exact role of O-GlcNAcylation in tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we show that O-GlcNAcylation accelerates oncogenic phenotypes of gastric cancer. First, cell models with increased or decreased O-GlcNAcylation were constructed by OGT overexpression, downregulation of OGA activity with specific inhibitor Thiamet-G, or silence of OGT. MTT assays indicated that O-GlcNAcylation increased proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Soft agar assay and Transwell assays showed that O-GlcNAcylation significantly enhanced cellular colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Akt1 activity was stimulated by upregulation of phosphorylation at Ser473 mediated by elevated O-GlcNAcylation. The enhanced cell invasion by Thiamet-G treatment was suppressed by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Although the cell invasion induced by Thiamet-G was reduced by Akt1 shRNA, it was still higher in comparison with that to the control (cells with Akt1 shRNA alone). And Akt1 overexpression promoted Thiamet-G-induced cell invasion. These results suggested that O-GlcNAcylation enhanced oncogenic phenotypes possibly partially involving PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

New advanced manufacturing technologies under the alias of additive biomanufacturing allow the design and fabrication of a range of products from pre-operative models, cutting guides and medical devices to scaffolds. The process of printing in 3 dimensions of cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and biomaterials (bioinks, powders, etc.) to generate in vitro and/or in vivo tissue analogue structures has been termed bioprinting. To further advance in additive biomanufacturing, there are many aspects that we can learn from the wider additive manufacturing (AM) industry, which have progressed tremendously since its introduction into the manufacturing sector. First, this review gives an overview of additive manufacturing and both industry and academia efforts in addressing specific challenges in the AM technologies to drive toward AM-enabled industrial revolution. After which, considerations of poly(lactides) as a biomaterial in additive biomanufacturing are discussed. Challenges in wider additive biomanufacturing field are discussed in terms of (a) biomaterials; (b) computer-aided design, engineering and manufacturing; (c) AM and additive biomanufacturing printers hardware; and (d) system integration. Finally, the outlook for additive biomanufacturing was discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.0
The integrated starter generator replaces the conventional starter and alternator with one electrical machine handling both functions. Start/Stop functionality, vehicle launch assistance, and higher speed transient power supplementing enhance the vehicle performance at the lower fuel consumption rate. This functionality requires the electrical machine to provide high starting and launch assistant torque in motoring mode and relatively high power capability over the wide speed range for battery charging. The overall cost of the system is the underlining concern and crucial part of the design optimization. This paper focuses on advantages of induction machines (IMs) in automotive industry and an approach to design a cost-effective electrical machine for belted starter-alternator applications. Design optimization of the IM is described to achieve desired performance, including rotor bar count, solid conductor (bar winding) versus stranded winding design, rotor bar shape optimization, and finally performance maps for the electrical machine, including both predicted and measured results. A thermal study of the machine is also presented, as well as the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) consideration in the design selection.	3.3
This research explored competing predictions for the relation between uncertainty and interpersonal attraction. Two studies investigated whether uncertainty regarding another person's interest is associated with an increase or decrease in attraction. Study 1 revealed that when participants evaluated people whose expressed attraction was either certain or uncertain, participants experienced more liking for those who were associated with certainty. In Study 2, compared to a control condition, uncertainty produced more attraction but the greater attraction was mediated by a desire to reduce uncertainty. We conclude by proposing an explanation for why different research paradigms have produced different conclusions regarding uncertainty and the situations necessary for uncertainty to produce interpersonal attraction.	2.2
This paper proposes a framework for the development of sensor node software for various operating systems in a sensor network environment. The proposed development framework consists of attributes, code templates and development support tool. Sensor node software is developed, based on the framework through four steps - sensor network modeling, PIM design, PSM design and code generation. Accordingly, this paper presents the methods for attributes design, code templates design, PIM-to-PSM mapping, and source code generation. Through the proposed technique, reusability of sensor network software will be increased since models, attributes and code templates can be reused for various operating systems through the framework. Productivity of software development will be increased, because software design is easily performed using attributes and software codes for all nodes in the sensor network can be generated at once from a model. Also, expandability of sensor network software will be increased, since new functions of existing operating systems or new operating systems can be added through the framework and sensor network software can be rebuilt by applying the added functions or operating systems.	0.4
The ballasted railroads form an integral part of the modern transportation infrastructure in Australia. However, they are subjected to large stresses especially on mixed traffic lines, where heavy freight trains are operated. Under such adverse operational conditions, ballast progressively degrades contributing to overall track deformations and frequent maintenance. Maintaining geometry of ballast embankments is necessary to improve safety and efficiency of railway operations. The use of artificial inclusions (geosynthetics and shock mats) as well as recycled (discarded) ballast in track can be economically viable options. In order to gain more insight, the CGRE has conducted extensive field trials on two rail lines in Bulli and Singleton in New South Wales supported by Sydney Trains and Australian Rail Track Corporation, respectively. In these studies, different types of geosynthetics (geogrid, geotextile and geocomposite) and shock mats were installed beneath the ballast layer constructed on varying subgrade conditions. Relative advantages of different geogrids were studied. Traffic induced stresses, ballast breakage, transient and permanent deformations were routinely monitored using precise instrumentation schemes. This paper discusses the details of track construction, instrumentation, monitoring processes and results of these field studies.	4.1
Recent work has suggested the presence of a variety of motives and mechanisms that affect young children's sharing decisions. Yet, little is known about the relative impact of these motives. In three experiments with 3- to 6-year-old children (total N=140), the current study contrasts two important recipient characteristics that have been suggested to play a major role in early sharing; the positive social relationship between children and recipients and the differences in recipients' wealth. To this end, children could allocate resources to a friend who already possessed a lot of them and to a nonfriend (Experiments 1 and 2) or a stranger (Experiment 3) who owned only very few resources. Across age, children showed a preference to share more with their rich friend, although this tendency was stronger in the older preschool children. The findings are discussed with respect to theoretical accounts on the psychological basis of early sharing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.4
The current study identified and examined perceived self-traits and behavioral traits as antecedents of online empathic experiences and prosocial behavior. Our findings suggest that perceived self-traits (i.e., self-efficacy in online relationship and self-disclosure), are strongly associated with both empathic experiences and prosocial behavior. Findings for the behavioral trait, interaction pattern of an individual, indicate that patterns of an individual's networking produce mixed results in regard to association with prosocial behavior. Bonding networking was found to positively predict prosocial behavior, while bridging networking showed a negative association with the same dependent measure. Identity discrepancy and writing activities were also found to positively affect prosocial behavior. Overall, the finding of this study indicates that perceived self-traits tend to display stronger explanatory power over both empathy and prosocial behavior than do behavioral traits.

Objectives. To evaluate partial remission during treatment with infliximab (IFX) + naproxen (NPX) vs NPX alone in patients from the two subgroups of SpA and explore baseline predictors of partial remission. Methods. Infliximab as First Line Therapy in Patients with Early Active Axial Spondyloarthritis Trial was a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of IFX in biologic-na < ve patients with early, active axial SpA. Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive 28 weeks of treatment with i.v. IFX 5 mg/kg (weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24) + NPX 1000 mg/day or i.v. placebo (PBO) + NPX 1000 mg/day. The current post hoc analysis evaluated outcomes in patients who did or did not meet modified New York radiographic criteria for AS. Results. The analysis included 94 patients who met AS criteria and 56 with non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA). At week 28, Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) partial remission was greater with IFX + NPX than PBO + NPX for both the AS group (70.5 vs 33.3%, respectively) and the nr-axSpA group (50.0 vs 37.5%, respectively). A similar pattern occurred with several efficacy measures. Larger treatment effects occurred in the AS group than the nr-axSpA group, possibly due to baseline differences in disease characteristics. Multivariable analyses identified the type of treatment, age and HLA-B27 status as predictors of ASAS partial remission in the total study population. MRI sacroiliac joint scores were associated with partial remission during IFX + NPX treatment. Conclusion. Patients with AS had greater partial remission with IFX + NSAID than NSAID therapy alone; patients with nr-axSpA had a smaller treatment effect. Baseline disease characteristics and age were associated with partial remission with IFX therapy.	5.3
The principle of a diode neutral point clamped three-phase three-level inverter with neutral line was analyzed, and the mathematical model of the main circuit is established on the basis of the operation principle. The oversample and multi-time calculation control strategy was proposed to reduce the typical delay in digital control and improve the system calculation accuracy, lower the inverter output voltage THD. In order to further improve the inverter output voltage waveform, the logic external execution was also proposed. The proposed control method was verified on a 20kVA inverter controlled by microchip processor IC30F5015 DSP. The experiment results indicated that the THD of the inverter output voltage is decreased considerably.	1.4
Introduction: Ultrasound (US) is a rapidly evolving technique that is gaining increasing success in the assessment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Recently, new research avenues have been opened, and these are focused on the potential of US for the assessment of extra musculoskeletal areas such as skin and nails. This permits work on the concept of holistic US assessment of PsA'.Areas covered: Here, we analyze the potential role of US in the global assessment of PsA. Additionally, we provide the current evidence supporting its application in routine clinical practice. Literature was obtained from medical databases including PubMed and Embase.Expert commentary: US can detect not only structural abnormalities but also minimal blood flow changes at the superficial soft tissue level. This makes it a great tool for the global assessment of disease activity in PsA, in which persistently active disease plays a major role in causing anatomical damage and physical functional disability.	5.3
Vagal tone is widely believed to be an important physiological aspect of emotion regulation and associated positive behaviors. However, there is inconsistent evidence for relations between children's baseline vagal tone and their helpful or prosocial responses to others (Hastings & Miller, 2014). Recent work in adults suggests a quadratic association (inverted U-shape curve) between baseline vagal tone and prosociality (Kogan et al., 2014). The present research examined whether this nonlinear association was evident in children. The authors found consistent evidence for a quadratic relation between vagal tone and prosociality across 3 samples of children using 6 different measures. Compared to low and high vagal tone, moderate vagal tone in early childhood concurrently predicted greater self-reported prosociality (Study 1), observed empathic concern in response to the distress of others and greater generosity toward less fortunate peers (Study 2), and longitudinally predicted greater self-, mother-, and teacher-reported prosociality 5.5 years later in middle childhood (Study 3). Taken together, the findings suggest that moderate vagal tone at rest represents a physiological preparedness or tendency to engage in different forms of prosociality across different contexts. Early moderate vagal tone may reflect an optimal balance of regulation and arousal that helps prepare children to sympathize, comfort, and share with others.	2.4
Lean design is a product design philosophy that aims to drive down resource waste on the factory floor using efficient design. Munro [i] provides data to show that Lean design has the greatest impact on the efficient workings of a manufacturing operation. Lean design influences floor-space, labor, raw material, quality, and ultimately profits for a manufacturing company. In this paper, how companies can pursue Lean design utilizing geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) through target manufacturing and zero tolerancing at the maximum material virtual condition (MMVC) are shown. Although these concepts are available in different places within GD&T and quality texts, the connection eludes some educators and most students. Further, how these concepts can be utilized by manufacturing companies as strategic tools to better communicate between product-design and manufacturing personnel is presented. Why it is important to include the concepts of Lean design in product design and manufacturing engineering curriculum is also explained.	3.2
Autism and related disorders are increasingly prevalent behavioral syndromes of impaired verbal and nonverbal communication and socialization owing to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The most recent estimate for the prevalence of autistic disorders is about 1% on a global scale. Etiology of autism is multifactorial and multidimensional that makes therapeutic intervention even harder. Heterogeneity of genetic factors, oxidative stress, autoimmune mechanism, and epigenetic mechanisms complicate the nature of pathogenesis of the disease. Nutraceutical approach to treat this disease is a promising strategy, especially in some areas, it is more attractive than others. This review critically analyzes the roles of vitamins and cofactors, dietary modifications and gut abnormalities, probiotics and prebiotics, phytochemicals, and environmental factors in order to determine the state of evidence in nutraceutical-based autism management practices. This article presents a systematic review of randomized- and placebocontrolled trials to examine the evidence supports the use of autism nutraceuticals. The results will be discussed in the light of all relevant evidence generated from other clinical and exploratory studies. (C) 2012 King Saud University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B. V.

In the present study, we have tested whether MRI T-1 relaxation time is a sensitive marker to detect early stages of amyloidosis and gliosis in the young 5xFAD transgenic mouse, a well-established animal model for Alzheimer's disease. 5xFAD and wild-type mice were imaged in a 4.7 T Varian horizontal bore MRI system to generate T-1 quantitative maps using the spin-echo multi-slice sequence. Following immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, Iba-1, and amyloid-beta, T-1 and area fraction of staining were quantified in the posterior parietal and primary somatosensory cortex and corpus callosum. In comparison with age-matched wild-type mice, we observed first signs of amyloidosis in 2.5-month-old 5xFAD mice, and development of gliosis in 5-month-old 5xFAD mice. In contrast, MRI T-1 relaxation times of young, i.e., 2.5- and 5-month-old, 5xFAD mice were not significantly different to those of age-matched wild-type controls. Furthermore, although disease progression was detectable by increased amyloid-beta load in the brain of 5-month-old 5xFAD mice compared with 2.5-month-old 5xFAD mice, MRI T-1 relaxation time did not change. In summary, our data suggest that MRI T-1 relaxation time is neither a sensitive measure of disease onset nor progression at early stages in the 5xFAD mouse transgenic mouse model.	5.2
Oenococcus oeni is a wine-associated lactic acid bacterium (LAB) responsible mostly for wine malolactic fermentation (MLF). This fastidious bacterium (auxotrophic for many amino acids and slow growing) possesses remarkable adaptability to harsh physicochemical conditions and can reprogramme its metabolic pathways to enhance its survival in wine. Thus, O. oeni is an instructive bacterial model for investigating stress response mechanisms in LAB. However, the lack of appropriate techniques to modify the O. oeni genome has hampered molecular studies of this species. The application of recent advances in molecular genetics promises to provide a better understanding of the regulation of stress responses in this species in the future.	6.4
The release of water from storage compartments to the transpiration stream is an important functional mechanism that provides the buffering of sudden fluctuations in water potential. The ability of tissues to release water per change in water potential, referred to as hydraulic capacitance, is assumed to be associated with the anatomy of storage tissues. However, information about how specific anatomical parameters determine capacitance is limited. In this study, we measured sapwood capacitance (C) in terminal branches and roots of five temperate tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Picea abies L., Quercus robur L., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Tilia cordata Mill.). Capacitance was calculated separately for water released mainly from capillary (C-I; open vessels, tracheids, fibres, intercellular spaces and cracks) and elastic storage compartments (C-II; living parenchyma cells), corresponding to two distinct phases of the moisture release curve. We found that C was generally higher in roots than branches, with C-I being 3-11 times higher than C-II. Sapwood density and the ratio of dead to living xylem cells were most closely correlated with C. In addition, the magnitude of C-I was strongly correlated with fibre/tracheid lumen area, whereas C-II was highly dependent on the thickness of axial parenchyma cell walls. Our results indicate that water released from capillary compartments predominates over water released from elastic storage in both branches and roots, suggesting the limited importance of parenchyma cells for water storage in juvenile xylem of temperate tree species. Contrary to intact organs, water released from open conduits in our small wood samples significantly increased C-I at relatively high water potentials. Linking anatomical parameters with the hydraulic capacitance of a tissue contributes to a better understanding of water release mechanisms and their implications for plant hydraulics.	3.1
Bone is a dynamic tissue whose remodeling throughout life is orchestrated by repeated cycles of destruction mediated by osteoclasts and rebuilding by osteoblasts. Current understanding of osteoclast biology has largely relied on the generation of knockout mice exhibiting an abnormal bone phenotype. This has provided a better understanding of osteoclast biology and the key proteins that support osteoclast function. However, mouse models alone do not provide an integrated view on protein networks and post-translational modifications that might be important for osteoclast function. During the past years, a number of MS-based quantitative methods have been developed to investigate the complexity of biological systems. This review will summarize how such approaches have contributed to the understanding of osteoclast differentiation and function.	6.1
The paper reviews in condensed form and from a historical perspective the various methods for treating and simulating turbulence and its effects in hydraulic flows. After highlighting the main characteristic features of turbulence and the role it plays in hydraulics, a necessarily brief overview is given of the main methods used in hydraulic flow calculations for dealing with turbulence and its effects. These are (1)empirical relations, (2)methods solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with the aid of statistical turbulence models, (3)direct numerical simulations (DNS), and (4)large-eddy simulations (LES). Brief comments are made on the historical development of the different methods, and for RANS, DNS, and LES methods some application examples are presented. For details on the individual methods and further application examples, the reader is directed to the very extensive literature.	3.1
The challenges of pedagogical interaction in drama are related to the teacher-student interaction. The aim of our research is to develop theatre based training programmes designed to take advantage of teachers' holistic, especially nonverbal communication interaction skills; presence and the use of bodies and space in educational settings. Our research questions are: 1) what theatre based tools can be used to teach body awareness? And 2) is it possible to use those practiced body messages consciously in teaching-studying-learning situations? The aim of this paper is to present the background and some aspects of the theory based practical training program we have developed to teach holistic interaction to professional teachers and teacher students in Helsinki University's teacher education Challenge of the Empty space - research project. We also present the preliminary results of the effectiveness of the training programme. Preliminary data collection was carried out between 2014 and 2016. Two groups of teacher students (N=36) and one group of qualified teachers (N=16) took the basic studies of drama education course (25 ECTS credits). Holistic interaction skills were especially studied in the theatre education course (7 ECTS credits). After the course the participants reflected on their learning by answering a questionnaire. All the respondents felt that they have learnt something new about teacher. student interaction and about the importance interactions during teaching. They mentioned that they had been paying close attention to their own supplementary communication. All the qualified teachers (N=16) described concrete situations where they have used new holistic interaction skills consciously. The results of the preliminary study reinforced our view. They give indications that teachers' body awareness in teaching situations can be developed with these methods. The results will help us to develop the theatre based training programme further.

Micro-particle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) is a quantitative full-field technique for the velocity measurement for flows in microfluidics. The flow fields of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in microchannels were investigated by micro-PIV. The velocity profiles in various polymethyl methacrylate square microchannels were measured. Polyacrylamide aqueous solutions with different concentrations served as non-Newtonian fluids. Two viscous Newtonian fluids were also employed to serve as reference, in particular to validate a lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation. Satisfactory flow measurements could be realized by the micro-PIV technique. The experimental velocity profile compares well with the LB simulation and an approximate solution. The experimentally measured velocity profile can lead to the quantification of the flow index of non-Newtonian fluids as an inline rheological characterization.	3.4
This paper presents a theoretical framework intended to accommodate circuit devices described by characteristics involving more than two fundamental variables. This framework is motivated by the recent appearance of a variety of so-called mem-devices in circuit theory, and makes it possible to model the coexistence of memory effects of different nature in a single device. With a compact formalism, this setting accounts for classical devices and also for circuit elements which do not admit a two-variable description. Fully nonlinear characteristics are allowed for all devices, driving the analysis beyond the framework of Chua and Di Ventra et al. We classify these fully nonlinear circuit elements in terms of the variables involved in their constitutive relations and the notions of the differential- and the state-order of a device. We extend the notion of a topologically degenerate configuration to this broader context, and characterize the differential-algebraic index of nodal models of such circuits. Additionally, we explore certain dynamical features ofmem-circuits involving manifolds of non-isolated equilibria. Related bifurcation phenomena are explored for a family of nonlinear oscillators based on mem-devices.	1.2
The present mechanism of metabolic formation of cholesterol is discussed and difficulties arising with the mechanism highlighted. A revision of the chemical reactions in biological cells which give rise to cholesterol and other sterols is presented. This mechanism of cholesterol formation is based on the forms and properties of polyphosphoric acids which are compounds common to both plant and animal cells. The reactions are examples of biochemical reactions which involve the stereochemistry of an inorganic molecule as well as the stereochemistry of organic molecules. It is demonstrated that cholesterol and related compounds entering or produced in the human metabolism are decomposed by the fluids of the digestive system and one product recycled for the production of further cholesterol. Links between the formation of cholesterol and degenerate conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, encountered in the human metabolism are discussed. Obesity and Metabolism 2011; 7: e6-e16.	6.2
Background: In previous studies by the authors, it was demonstrated that a fibronectin ( FN)- derived oligopeptide, termed F20, stimulates osteoblast differentiation in vitro and bone formation in vivo. However, the fundamental molecular mechanism by which F20 stimulates osteogenesis remains unknown. Therefore, in this study the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of F20 in osteoblast differentiation is investigated. Methods: The role of F20 in osteoblast differentiation was examined using mouse bone- marrow- derived ST2 cell line. The effect of Smad1/ 5 was determined following small interfering RNA knockdown. Runt- related transcription factor ( Runx) 2, alkaline phosphatase ( Alp), and osteocalcin ( Oc) mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real- time polymerase chain reaction, and their transcriptional activation was assessed using luciferase reporter assays. Extracellular signalregulated kinase ( ERK) phosphorylation was visualized via immunoblotting. Results: Synthetic oligopeptide F20 stimulated expression of bone marker genes Runx2, Alp, and Oc in ST2 cells via Smad and ERK or mitogen- activated protein kinase signaling pathways as did bone morphogenic protein 2 ( BMP2). Furthermore, Runx2 acted as a transcription factor during F20induced osteoblast differentiation. Conclusions: Collectively, these results indicate that F20 induces osteoblast differentiation with a pattern similar to that mediated by BMP2 signaling pathway. The authors' previous data also showed that FN- derived oligopeptide improved wound healing, and it is suggested that F20 might serve as a therapeutic biomolecule to facilitate periodontal tissue regeneration.	6.0
Extreme sports such as canyoneering have expanded greatly since the turn of the century yet little scientific attention has been paid to the analyses of the dangers of those activities. The author was much involved in promoting one such sport, namely canyoneering, and presents this paper as an example of the kind of fluids engineering analyses that are needed in order to objectively quantify those dangers and properly advise the participants. In canyoneering, the primary fluid-related sources of danger are the impact of falling water on the human body and the dangers a swimmer faces in a plunge pool. This paper presents rough evaluations of both dangers.	3.4
The softwarization of networks promises cost savings and better scalability of network functions by moving functionality from specialized devices into commercial off-the-shelf hardware. Generalized computing hardware offers many degrees for adjustment and tuning, which can affect performance and resource utilization. One of these adjustments are the interrupt moderation techniques implemented by modern network interface cards and operating systems. Using these, an administrator can optimize either lower latencies or lower CPU overhead for processing of network traffic. In this work, an analytical model that allows computing relevant performance metrics like the packet processing time and the packet loss for generic virtualized network functions running on commodity hardware is developed. The applicability of the model is shown by comparing its outcome with measurements conducted in a local testbed featuring a VNF that acts as an LTE Serving Gateway (SGW). Based on this model, impact factors like the average packet interarrival time, the interarrival time distribution, and the duration of the interrupt aggregation interval are studied.	0.4
Massive public pressure is arising to achieve data privacy and protection. One way to maintain data privacy is to perform efficient data disposal processes. This minimizes the chances of data leakage over an extended period and through irresponsible actions. That is why adequate data disposal is essential in so many governmental and critical institutions. Simply deleting data does not erase it. In fact, it only removes the name that refers to that piece of data, but the data itself remains. In this paper, we utilize an encryption algorithm and then perform a randomization process to dispose of data values in an irreversible approach making it difficult to retrieve the original value of data from the defaced result.	0.3
Background: The transcription factor Ets1 is highly expressed in B lymphocytes. Loss of Ets1 leads to premature B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), secretion of autoantibodies, and development of autoimmune disease. Despite the importance of Ets1 in B cell biology, few Ets1 target genes are known in these cells. Results: To obtain a more complete picture of the function of Ets1 in regulating B cell differentiation, we performed Ets1 ChIP-seq in primary mouse B cells to identify >10,000-binding sites, many of which were localized near genes that play important roles in B cell activation and differentiation. Although Ets1 bound to many sites in the genome, it was required for regulation of less than 5% of them as evidenced by gene expression changes in B cells lacking Ets1. The cohort of genes whose expression was altered included numerous genes that have been associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility. We focused our attention on four such Ets1 target genes Ptpn22, Stat4, Egr1, and Prdm1 to assess how they might contribute to Ets1 function in limiting ASC formation. We found that dysregulation of these particular targets cannot explain altered ASC differentiation in the absence of Ets1. Conclusion: We have identified genome-wide binding targets for Ets1 in B cells and determined that a relatively small number of these putative target genes require Ets1 for their normal expression. Interestingly, a cohort of genes associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility is among those that are regulated by Ets1. Identification of the target genes of Ets1 in B cells will help provide a clearer picture of how Ets1 regulates B cell responses and how its loss promotes autoantibody secretion.	5.3
Behaviour is central to many fields, but metatheoretical definitions specifying the most basic assumptions about what is considered behaviour and what is not are largely lacking. This transdisciplinary research explores the challenges in defining behaviour, highlighting anthropocentric biases and a frequent lack of differentiation from physiological and psychical phenomena. To meet these challenges, the article elaborates a metatheoretical definition of behaviour that is applicable across disciplines and that allows behaviours to be differentiated from other kinds of phenomena. This definition is used to explore the phenomena of language and to scrutinise whether and under what conditions language can be considered behaviour and why. The metatheoretical concept of two different levels of meaning conveyed in human language is introduced, highlighting that language inherently relies on behaviours and that the content of what-is-being-said, in and of itself, can constitute (interpersonal) behaviour under particular conditions. The analyses reveal the ways in which language meaningfully extends human's behavioural possibilities, pushing them far beyond anything enabled by non-language behaviours. These novel metatheoretical concepts can complement and expand on existing theories about behaviour and language and contribute a novel piece of theoretical explanation regarding the crucial role that language has played in human evolution.	2.3
The paper introduces a new approach on design of distributed manufacturing control systems. It will be shown how multi-agent principles, self-learning, self-adaptation and a new engineering method for distributed production systems can be used to enhance integration of production control process quality control. It will be highlighted how multi-agent systems may be implemented to enforce interaction of manufacturing execution system and distributed control system, enhancing the exploitation of all available information at the quality control and process control levels. Additional focus is set on production process modeling, quality control algorithms and an engineering methodology integrating all these aspects within. The final results are validated in the field of white ware using a washing machine production line.	3.2
Mixed payment systems have become a prominent alternative to paying physicians through fee-for-service and capitation. While theory shows mixed payment systems to be superior, causal effects on physicians' behavior when introducing mixed systems are not well understood empirically. We systematically analyze the influence of fee-for-service, capitation, and mixed payment systems on physicians' service provision. In a controlled laboratory setting, we implement an exogenous variation of the payment method. Medical and non-medical students in the role of physicians in the lab (N = 213) choose quantities of medical services affecting patients' health outside the lab. Behavioral data reveal significant overprovision of medical services under fee-for-service and significant underprovision under capitation, although less than predicted when assuming profit maximization. Introducing mixed payment systems significantly reduces deviations from patient-optimal treatment. Although medical students tend to be more patient regarding, our results hold for both medical and non-medical students. Responses to incentive systems can be explained by a behavioral model capturing individual altruism. In particular, we find support that altruism plays a role in service provision and can partially mitigate agency problems, but altruism is heterogeneous in the population.

With the fully mature and a vast number of available virtualization solutions, there is an uptake in creating the opportunity for remote and/or virtual laboratories to either supplement or fully replace physical networking laboratories. Our approach focuses on nodes, rather than environments hosting the nodes. The paper addresses setting up virtual laboratories made of widely available, general purpose, operating systems based on Linux that act as a network operating system. We discuss several Software Defined Networking solutions, and lay out the configuration setup for virtual laboratories. We evaluate them by the opportunity they provide in the context of learning and a potential experience. We conclude with an observation that with an increasing number of Linux based network operating systems, management of network forwarding devices becomes management of servers, which leads to the unification of the cloud fabric.	0.4
Supraglacial rivers on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) transport large volumes of surface meltwater toward the ocean, yet have received relatively little direct research. This study presents field observations of channel width, depth, velocity, and water surface slope for nine supraglacial channels on the south-western GrIS collected between July 23 and August 20, 2012. Field sites are located up to 74km inland and span 494-1485m elevation, and contain measured discharges larger than any previous in situ study: from 0.006 to 23.12m(3)/s in channels 0.20 to 20.62m wide. All channels were deeply incised with near vertical banks, and hydraulic geometry results indicate that supraglacial channels primarily accommodate greater discharges by increasing velocity. Smaller streams had steeper water surface slopes (0.74-8.83%) than typical in terrestrial settings, yielding correspondingly high velocities (0.40-2.60m/s) and Froude numbers (0.45-3.11) with supercritical flow observed in 54% of measurements. Derived Manning's n values were larger and more variable than anticipated from channels of uniform substrate, ranging from 0.009 to 0.154 with a mean value of 0.035 +/- 0.027 despite the absence of sediment, debris, or other roughness elements. Ubiquitous micro-depressions in shallow sections of the channel bed may explain some of these roughness values. However, we find that other, unobserved sources of flow resistance likely contributed to these elevated Manning's n values: future work should explicitly consider additional sources of flow resistance beyond bed roughness in supraglacial channels. We conclude that hydraulic modeling for these channels must allow for both subcritical and supercritical flow, and most importantly must refrain from assuming that all ice-substrate channels exhibit similar hydraulic behavior, especially for Froude numbers and Manning's n. Finally, this study highlights that further theoretical and empirical work on supraglacial channel hydraulics is necessary before broad scale understanding of ice sheet hydrology can be achieved.

In recent years, flux switching machines (FSMs) have been an attractive research topic owing to their tremendous advantages of robust rotor structure, high torque, and high power capability suitable for intensive applications. However, most of the investigations are focusing on the inner-rotor structure, which is incongruous for direct drive applications. In this study, high torque and power densities of a new 12S-14P outer-rotor permanent magnet (PM) FSM with a DC excitation coil was investigated based on two-dimensional fmite element analysis for in-wheel direct drive electric vehicle (EV). Based on some design restrictions and specifications, design refinements were conducted on the original design machine by using the deterministic optimization approach. With only 1.0 kg PM, the final design machine achieved the maximum torque and power densities of 12.4 Nm/kg and 5.93 kW/kg, respectively, slightly better than the inner-rotor HEFSM and interior PM synchronous machine design for EV.	3.3
Treatment of cow's urine was first time explored in clayware microbial fuel cell (MFC) by varying dilution to have different chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the feed. Improvement in power output of MFC was attained with increase in feed concentration from 1.5 to 3 kg COD/m(3); however further increase in influent COD up to 30 kg COD/m(3) decreased the power. Maximum power of 5.23 W/m(3) was attained in MFC fed with diluted urine of cow with COD concentration of 3 kg COD/m(3), which was seven-fold higher than MFC fed with raw urine. Nitrate removal of 77 +/- 4.1% and carbohydrate removal of 80 +/- 3.9% were achieved in MFC fed with 3 kg COD/m(3). Electrochemical analysis showed that electrogenic activity of anodic biofilm boosted at optimum feed concentration (3 kg COD/m(3)) of cow's urine in anodic chamber. Using two MFCs, fed with diluted cow's urine, maximum voltage of 1.36 +/- 0.05 V in series connection and maximum current of 48 A/m(3) in parallel connection were achieved. Thus, cow's urine can serve as sustainable yellow gold to harvest bioelectricity using low cost clayware MFC, and to curb the water pollution likely caused from cattle sheds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is of great value to corrosion studies because it is sensitive to transient changes that occur in the metal-electrolyte interface. A useful way to link the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to corrosion phenomena is by simulating equivalent circuits. Equivalent circuit models are very attractive because of their relative simplicity, enabling the monitoring of electrochemical systems that have a complex physical mechanism. In this paper, the stochastic algorithm Differential Evolution is proposed to fit an equivalent circuit to the EIS results for a wide potential range. EIS is often limited to the corrosion potential despite being widely used. This greatly hinders the analysis regarding the effect of the applied potential, which strongly affects the interface, as shown, for example, in polarization curves. Moreover, the data from both the EIS and the DC values were used in the proposed scheme, allowing the best fit of the model parameters. The approach was compared to the standard Simplex square residual minimization of EIS data. In order to manage the large amount of generated data, the EIS-Mapper software package, which also plots the 2D/3D diagrams with potential, was used to fit the equivalent circuit of multiple diagrams. Furthermore, EIS-Mapper also computed all simulations. The results of 67 impedance diagrams of stainless steel in a 3.5% NaCl medium at 25 degrees C obtained in steps of 10 mV, and the respective values of the fitted parameters of the equivalent circuit are reported. The present approach conveys new insight to the use of electrochemical impedance and bridges the gap between polarization curves and equivalent electrical circuits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper describes the conservation of a figurative and geometrical patterned 5th century A. D. mosaic in the ruins of the House of the Ionic Capitals in Hierapolis, which is one of the world heritage sites. The mosaic had significant quantity of detached and disintegrated tesserae as a result of deterioration of its bedding layer. The conservation process included fixing detached tesserae by reinforcing the bedding layer with lime mortars; integrating disintegrated original tesserae to fill the small lacunae for a better visual perception; mechanical and poultice cleaning; using permeable geotextile in reburial against environmental factors, and herbicide application to prevent plant intrusion.

Previous studies suggest that climate change impacts significantly on the hydro-climatic processes within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) River Basin (RB). This study examines the observed climate characteristics and potential strengths and limitations of three global high-resolution reanalyses and satellite remote-sensing products over the GBM RB for period 1980-2013 by (1) estimating trends and interannual variations of precipitation and temperature, and (2) isolating precipitation variations likely associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The surface temperature trends show widespread warming across the basin with a maximum increase of 0.6 degrees Cdecade(-1) over western Nepal and southern Tibet from 1980 to 2013. Rainfall changes from 1980 to 2013 indicate pronounced decline over high rainfall regions of northeast India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, especially from 1998 to 2013. Basin-wide averaged trends show rainfall decline of up to 39mmdecade(-1) in June-August in the Brahmaputra-Meghna RB from 1998 to 2013. Temperature variability based on Principal Component Analysis indicates that the first mode is associated with sea surface temperature (SST) warming in the Arabian Sea and the western tropical Pacific Ocean, while the second mode appears to be significantly correlated to SST anomalies in the western (eastern) tropical Indian (Pacific) Ocean. ENSO and IOD events are found to significantly influence rainfall variability contributing to about 10-20% (ENSO) and 8-10% (IOD) of the annual rainfall, mainly over Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and north-eastern India. Among the three reanalysis products: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) retrospective analysis (ERA-Interim), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), ERA-Interim (and MERRA) agrees well with the observed precipitation (temperature) data sets while, CFSR shows the least skills in representing the spatio-temporal variations of precipitation and temperature.	4.2
Background/AimAntibiotic allergies are frequently reported and have significant impacts upon appropriate prescribing and clinical outcomes. We surveyed infectious diseases physicians, allergists, clinical immunologists and hospital pharmacists to evaluate antibiotic allergy knowledge and service delivery in Australia and New Zealand. MethodsAn online multi-choice questionnaire was developed and endorsed by representatives of the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) and the Australasian Society of Infectious Diseases (ASID). The 37-item survey was distributed in April 2015 to members of ASCIA, ASID, the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. ResultsOf 277 respondents, 94% currently use or would utilise antibiotic allergy testing (AAT) and reported seeing up to 10 patients/week labelled as antibiotic-allergic. Forty-two per cent were not aware of or did not have AAT available. Most felt that AAT would aid antibiotic selection, antibiotic appropriateness and antimicrobial stewardship (79, 69 and 61% respectively). Patients with the histories of immediate hypersensitivity were more likely to be referred than those with delayed hypersensitivities (76 vs 41%, P=0.0001). Lack of specialist physicians (20%) and personal experience (17%) were barriers to service delivery. A multidisciplinary approach was a preferred AAT model (53%). Knowledge gaps were identified, with the majority overestimating rates of penicillin/cephalosporin (78%), penicillin/carbapenem (57%) and penicillin/monobactam (39%) cross-reactivity. ConclusionsA high burden of antibiotic allergy labelling and demand for AAT is complicated by a relative lack availability or awareness of AAT services in Australia and New Zealand. Antibiotic allergy education and deployment of AAT, accessible to community and hospital-based clinicians, may improve clinical decisions and reduce antibiotic allergy impacts. A collaborative approach involving infectious diseases physicians, pharmacists and allergists/immunologists is required.	5.1
There is great interest in the use of biomarkers to assist in the timely identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with mild symptoms. However, the inclusion of AD biomarkers in clinical criteria poses socioethical challenges. The Geneva Task Force for the Roadmap of Alzheimer's Biomarkers was established to deliver a systematic strategic research agenda (aka roadmap) to promote efficient and effective validation of AD biomarkers and to foster their uptake in clinical practice. In this article, we summarize the workshop discussion of the Geneva Task Force  ethical and societal issues working group, which comprised bioethicists, clinicians, health economists, and representatives of those affected by AD. The working group identified the following key issues that need to be included in the roadmap: improving access to services through timely diagnosis, the need for a diagnostic research protocol before moving to clinical routine, recruitment in diagnostic research protocols in the absence of effective therapy, respect for the autonomy of the individual with mild cognitive impairment in information and consent process and the right not to know biomarkers results, need for counseling programs, disclosure of the diagnosis in a structured environment and the involvement of family members, health policies including the individuals' views and the protection of their interests, and the economic costs for society.

Degraded hills can be restored by afforestation and conserving soil and water through rainwater harvesting. Three slope categories viz.20% of a degraded hill were treated with rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures: Contour trench (CT), Gradonie (GD), Box trench (BT) and V-ditch (VD) including a control with a view to rehabilitate it by conserving and minimizing gradient in soil water and nutrients. Soil water content (SWC), height and collar diameter of Acacia catechu, Azadirachta Emblica officinalis, Holoptelia integrifolia and Zyziphus mauritiana planted in August 2005, herbaceous biomass and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interceptions by tree, vegetation and tree-vegetation combine (PAR(intT/V/C)) were monitored for suitability of RWH devices and tree species in rehabilitation. SWC decreased from December to June and it was linearly related to rainfall and vegetation height. PAR(int) by tree, vegetation, and tree-vegetation combine were 30.0%, 54.6% and 84.6%, respectively and helped conserve soil water. SWC, plant and vegetation growth and PAR(intT) were lowest (P < 0.05), whereas herbaceous biomass and PAR(intV) were highest in 10-20% slope. Vegetation height and SWC were linearly related to biomass indicating improvement in micro-climate and herbaceous growth. Highest SWC in <10% slope promoted plant growth and mean annual increment (MAI) in height and collar diameter, which enhanced PAR(intT) and PAR(intC). These variables were highest in CT/BT treatments and lowest in control plots. Characteristic root distribution of Acacia catechu and A. indica promoted growth in V-ditch, whereas E. officinalis, Z mauritiana and H. integrefolia performed best in CT treatment. RWH enhanced herbaceous biomass between 22.4% and 60.7% over control. Conclusively, VD/GD structures found best for growth of herbaceous vegetation as well as A. catechu and A. indica plants, whereas CT/BT structures favoured growth of other tree species. Rainfall influenced SWC, but RWH helped conserve soil and water, promoted plantation and herbaceous growth and facilitated restoration process, and may be promoted to restore degrading lands.

The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched on January 31, 2015 to provide global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every 2-3 days using an L-band (active) radar and an L-band (passive) radiometer. The Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product (L2_SM_P) provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36-km Earth-fixed grid using brightness temperature observations from descending passes. This paper provides the first comparison of the validated-release L2_SM_P product with soil moisture products provided by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Aquarius, Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) missions. This comparison was conducted as part of the SMAP calibration and validation efforts. SMAP and SMOS appear most similar among the five soil moisture products considered in this paper, overall exhibiting the smallest unbiased root-mean-square difference and highest correlation. Overall, SMOS tends to be slightly wetter than SMAP, excluding forests where some differences are observed. SMAP and Aquarius can only be compared for a little more than two months; they compare well, especially over low to moderately vegetated areas. SMAP and ASCAT show similar overall trends and spatial patterns with ASCAT providing wetter soil moistures than SMAP over moderate to dense vegetation. SMAP and AMSR2 largely disagree in their soil moisture trends and spatial patterns; AMSR2 exhibits an overall dry bias, while desert areas are observed to be wetter than SMAP.	4.2
The vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) foresees a future Internet incorporating smart physical objects that offer hosted functionality as IoT services. These services when integrated with the traditional enterprise level services form the creation of ambient intelligence for a wide range of applications. To facilitate seamless access and service life cycle management of large, distributed and heterogeneous IoT resources, service oriented computing and resource oriented approaches have been widely used as promising technologies. However, a reference architecture integrating IoT services into either of these two technologies is still an open research challenge. In this article, we adopt the resource oriented approach to provide an end-to-end integration architecture of front-end IoT devices with the back-end business process applications. The proposed architecture promises a programmer friendly access to IoT services, an event management mechanism to propagate context information of IoT devices, a service replacement facility upon service failure, and a decentralized execution of the IoT aware business processes.

This paper describes the effect of embedment depth on bearing capacity of footing supported by geocell-reinforced bed, using plate load test at a diameter of 300 mm. The embedment depth ratio of the footing was varied from zero to 0.75. The plate load tests were performed in an outdoor test pit dug in natural ground measuring 2000 x 2000 mm in plan and 1000 mm in depth. The geocell used in the tests was non-perforated with pocket size 110 x 110 mm2 and height 100 mm, fabricated from continuous polypropylene filaments as a nonwoven geotextile. The tests were conducted on geocell reinforced bed sand, which was compacted to 85% relative density. The test results demonstrate that the bearing pressure increases with increase in the embedment depth ratio and the number of geocell layers. The study also compares the embedment depth ratio of one layer geocell reinforcement with two and three layer geocell reinforcement bed with no embedment depth. These comparisons show that the performance of footing on single layer reinforced bed with the embedment depth ratio of 0.25 and 0.75 might be comparable to the performance of footing on geocell-reinforced bed with two and three reinforcement layers.

Research on empathic development, though extensive, has largely overlooked two vital facets of flexible empathic respondingmultideterminism (which is elicited in response to various cues) and context dependence (i.e., empathic responding that can be regulated depending on contextual factors). Within a dual-process account of empathic responding (in which both bottom-up and top-down processes contribute), such flexible empathic responding relies heavily on top-down processes. Yet most developmental research has not systematically considered the role of top-down processes in bringing about multidetermined and context-dependent empathic responding; as such, it provides a narrow view of early empathic responding. Recent research has begun to fill these gaps and suggests that top-down processes are involved even in early flexible empathic responding. But much more work is needed, particularly on developmental mechanisms and the development of top-down processes, to understand fully the origins of flexible concern.	2.4
Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) are popular market-based mechanisms for promoting development of renewable power generation. However, they are usually implemented without considering the capabilities and cost of transmission infrastructure. We use single-and multi-stage planning approaches to find cost-effective transmission and generation investments to meet single and multi-year RPS goals, respectively. Using a six-node network and assuming a linearized DC power flow, we examine how the lumpy nature of network reinforcements and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law can affect the performance of RPSs. First, we show how simplified planning approaches that ignore transmission constraints, transmission lumpiness, or Kirchhoff's voltage law yield distorted estimates of the type and location of infrastructure, as well as inaccurate compliance costs to meet the renewable goals. Second, we illustrate how lumpy transmission investments and Kirchhoff's voltage law result in compliance costs that are nonconvex with respect to the RPS targets, in the sense that the marginal costs of meeting the RPS may decrease rather than increase as the target is raised. Thus, the value of renewable energy certificates (RECs) also depends on the network topology, as does the amount of noncompliance with the RPS, if noncompliance is penalized but not prohibited. Finally, we use a multi-stage planning model to determine the optimal generation and transmission infrastructure for RPS designs that set multiyear goals. We find that the optimal infrastructure to meet RPS policies that are enforced year-by-year differ from the optimal infrastructure if banking and borrowing is allowed in the REC market.	1.3
Introduction: Myasthenia gravis is the most frequent acquired disorder of neuromuscular transmission. In the majority of cases, pathogenic antibodies against components of the postsynaptic muscle endplate membrane can be detected. In recent years there have been significant advances in the pathophysiological understanding and therapy of the disease.Areas covered: PubMed searches were conducted for the term myasthenia gravis' cross-referenced with the terms immunology', subgroups', antibody', ocular', thymoma', treatment' and thymectomy'. Additionally, we summarized the current state of immunopathology and therapy.Expert commentary: Immunological research defined new target antigens at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction which along with clinical features allow a refined definition of disease subgroups. Overall the prognosis of myasthenia gravis with best possible symptomatic, immunosuppressive and supportive treatment is good but new immunomodulatory treatment options are developed for patients who do not respond well to the first line therapy. For most patients individually adapted long-term drug therapy is needed.	6.3
Ideas of reference are common in human beings, but they are frequent in certain psychopathological disorders, mainly those concerning the psychotic spectrum. The purpose of this study was to attempt to construct a model predicting the appearance of ideas of reference and to test the relationship of personality (based on the Gray model), emotional, and self-consciousness variables. Five-hundred and seventy-four participants (287 patients with several different psychopathological diagnoses) filled in the Referential Thinking Scale (REF), the GHQ-28, the Self-Consciousness Scale (SCS-R), and the SPSRQ Scale. The resulting model found full mediation of sensitivity to punishment, sensitivity to reward, depression, and public self-consciousness between anxiety and ideas of reference, regardless of the group they were in (patients vs. nonpatients). This result, based on the appearance of anxiety symptomatology, explains 43% of the variance in scores, showing the presence of ideas of reference and therefore enables prediction of a set of vulnerabilities (established with self-reports) which could lead to a psychological state of high general pathological risk and proneness to psychosis in particular.	5.4
Self-resemblance has been found to have a context-dependent effect when expressing preferences for faces. Whereas dissimilarity preference during mate choice in animals is often explained as an evolutionary adaptation to increase heterozygosity of offspring, self-resemblance can be also favored in humans, reflecting, e.g., preference for kinship cues. We performed two studies, using transformations of facial photographs to manipulate levels of resemblance with the rater, to examine the influence of self resemblance in single vs. coupled individuals. Raters assessed facial attractiveness of other-sex and same sex photographs according to both short-term and long-term relationship contexts. We found a preference for dissimilarity of other-sex and same-sex faces in single individuals, but no effect of self-resemblance in coupled raters. No effect of sex of participant or short-term vs. long-term attractiveness rating was observed. The results support the evolutionary interpretation that dissimilarity of other-sex faces is preferred by uncoupled individuals as an adaptive mechanism to avoid inbreeding. In contrast, lower dissimilarity preference of other-sex faces in coupled individuals may reflect suppressed attention to attractiveness cues in potential alternative partners as a relationship maintenance mechanism, and its substitution by attention to cues of kinship and psychological similarity connected with greater likelihood of prosocial behavior acquisition from such persons.	2.4
Early diagnosis of social isolation in older adults can prevent physical and cognitive impairment. This diagnosis usually consists on personal and periodic application of psychological assessment instruments. Unfortunately this is often a tedious process and therefore this is a situation that opens up opportunities in creating new ways of diagnosis. In this context, ambient intelligence and social networking sites are suitable technologies for automatic monitoring of significant changes in social interactions of older adults. However, current instruments that measure social isolation are based on subjective aspects since they only evaluate emotional social support and they do not consider objective aspects. This is the reason why a prediction model based on objective isolation variables is needed in order to measure the social interactions through computing mechanisms. This paper presents the development of a prediction model from the social interaction activities that can be registered through smartphone's sensory capabilities, the personal communications using an online social network and also radio-frequency identification mechanisms. The proposed model will benefit institutions interested in developing technological solutions to detect early stages of social isolation and improve the quality of life of older adults.	4.0
Background: The rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) is involved in reflective thought processes such as self-knowledge and person perception. We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse, which is disruptive of emotional regulation, would differentially impact neurometabolite concentrations of the RPFC, and related neocortical areas, in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) versus healthy controls. Methods: GAD patients (n=16; females =11) and medically healthy volunteers (n=16; F=10) were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), specifically the emotional abuse category. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging examined 3 regions of interest (ROI) from the most rostral slice from the Duyn el. al. (1993) multivoxel imaging modality: rostral prefrontal cortex (BA 10,9), premotor cortex (BA 6,8) and secondary somatosensory and associated parietal cortex (BA 5,7). Meta-bolites included N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine, and choline. Results: GAD patients reported higher emotional abuse scores versus controls. An omnibus general linear model including 3 ROI, 3 metabolites, and laterality as dependent variables revealed a significant diagnosis by CTQ emotional abuse score interactive effect. In controls, all 3 ROI for all 3 metabolites on both sides demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with emotional abuse scores; none were significant in GAD patients. Limitations: A major limitation is the uneven distribution of emotional abuse scores between the controls and GAD patients, with GAD patients reporting higher scores. Conclusion: Unlike controls, GAD patients appear compromised in forming a molecular representation reflective of magnitude of childhood emotional abuse. The neurometabolites in GAD patients appear non-aligned to childhood emotional abuse, suggesting potential consequences for normative theory of mind processes and emotional function in certain anxiety disorders.

In this paper the optimal design of an Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) with the goal of minimizing the lifecycle cost, while taking into account environmental emissions, is presented. Different energy sources such as renewable energy technology based and diesel generation are considered, with realistic inputs on their physical, operating and economic characteristics. In order to address the range anxiety, concern of EV owners regarding the distance the vehicle can travel, the design of an EVCS along highways, as an isolated microgrid, is studied. In another study, the EVCS is assumed to be connected to the grid as a smart energy hub. The charging demand of the EVCS is estimated considering real drive data. Analysis is also carried out to compare the economics of a grid-connected EVCS with an isolated EVCS and the optimal break-even distance for the grid connected EVCS to be a viable option, is determined.

With the development of nanotechnology, understanding of intermolecular interactions on a single molecule level by atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) has played an important role in molecular biology and biomedical science. In recent years, some research suggested that the presence of metal cations is an important regulator in the processes of misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta), which may be an important etiological factor of Alzheimer's disease. However, the knowledge on the principle of interactions between A beta and metal cations at the single molecule level is still poor understood. In this paper, the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) was fabricated on substrate of mixed thiol-modified gold nanoparticles using self-assembled monolayer method and the adhesion force in the longitudinal direction between metal cations and A beta 42 were investigated by AFM. The role of metal ions on A beta aggregation is discussed from the perspective of single molecular force. The force results showed that the specific adhesion force F-i and the nonspecific force F-0 between a single A beta-A beta pair in control experiment were calculated as 42 +/- 3 and 80 pN, respectively. However, Fi between a single A beta-A beta pair in the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Al3+ increased dramatically to 84 +/- 6, 89 +/- 3, 73 +/- 5, 95 +/- 5 pN successively, which indicated that unbinding between A beta proteins is accelerated in the presence of metal cations. What is more, the imaging results showed that substoichiometric copper cations accelerate the formation of fibrils within 3 days. The combined atomic force spectroscopy and imaging analysis indicate that metal cations play a role in promoting the aggregating behavior of A beta 42.	6.0
Background: Legionella spp. employ multiple strategies to adapt to stressful environments including the proliferation in protective biofilms and the ability to form associations with free-living amoeba (FLA). The aim of the current study was to identify Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., Vermamoeba (Hartmannella) vermiformis and Naegleria fowleri that persist in a harvested rainwater and solar pasteurization treatment system. Methods: Pasteurized (45 degrees C, 65 degrees C, 68 degrees C, 74 degrees C, 84 degrees C and 93 degrees C) and unpasteurized tank water samples were screened for Legionella spp. and the heterotrophic plate count was enumerated. Additionally, ethidium monoazide quantitative polymerase chain reaction (EMA-qPCR) was utilized for the quantification of viable Legionella spp., Acanthamoeba spp., V. vermiformis and N. fowleri in pasteurized (68 degrees C, 74 degrees C, 84 degrees C and 93 degrees C) and unpasteurized tank water samples, respectively. Results: Of the 82 Legionella spp. isolated from unpasteurized tank water samples, Legionella longbeachae (35 %) was the most frequently isolated, followed by Legionella norrlandica (27 %) and Legionella rowbothamii (4 %). Additionally, a positive correlation was recorded between the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. detected (rho = 0.710, P = 0.048) and the heterotrophic plate count vs. the number of Legionella spp. isolated (rho = 0.779, P = 0.0028) from the tank water samples collected. Solar pasteurization was effective in reducing the gene copies of viable V. vermiformis (3-log) and N. fowleri (5-log) to below the lower limit of detection at temperatures of 68-93 degrees C and 74-93 degrees C, respectively. Conversely, while the gene copies of viable Legionella and Acanthamoeba were significantly reduced by 2-logs (P = 0.0024) and 1-log (P = 0.0015) overall, respectively, both organisms were still detected after pasteurization at 93 degrees C. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that Acanthamoeba spp. primarily acts as the vector and aids in the survival of Legionella spp. in the solar pasteurized rainwater as both organisms were detected and were viable at high temperatures (68-93 degrees C).	4.3
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore and engage with connections between the evolving technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) and notions of convenience. In particular, the concept of alpha convenience is introduced in order to articulate the broad scope of Internet any-everything connectivity, here called alpha convenience. Design/methodology/approach - The recommendations of Constructive Technology Assessment are followed in order to evaluate technology before implementation. The seven value drivers articulated by Fleisch (2010) are utilized in order to envision-specific aspects. Findings - Three critical aspects relating to alpha convenience are identified and discussed: gossiping technology, personalization and the disempowered smartphone user. It is argued that extreme forms of convenience shift traditional areas of human agency onto technology. It is also noted that alpha convenience tends to develop as ubiquitous feature of future society, making it difficult, if not impossible, to opt out. Research limitations/implications - The paper focusses on one powerful concept, although the IoT is merely one of several terms used to deliberate the role of next-generation information technology and society. Notable competitors include semantic web, ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Social implications - The IoT is predicted to be an intrusive feature into everyday life and the paper identifies important aspects. Originality/value - This is the first critical discussion of the IoT and convenience. The paper aims at conceptual innovation. Overall, there is a substantial lack of critical scrutiny of the emerging ideas of the IoT.	4.0
Background: Food allergy is an important public health problem because it affects children and adults, can be severe and even life-threatening, and may be increasing in prevalence. Beginning in 2008, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, working with other organizations and advocacy groups, led the development of the first clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. A recent landmark clinical trial and other emerging data suggest that peanut allergy can be prevented through introduction of peanut-containing foods beginning in infancy. Objectives: Prompted by these findings, along with 25 professional organizations, federal agencies, and patient advocacy groups, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facilitated development of addendum guidelines to specifically address the prevention of peanut allergy. Results: The addendum provides 3 separate guidelines for infants at various risk levels for the development of peanut allergy and is intended for use by a wide variety of health care providers. Topics addressed include the definition of risk categories, appropriate use of testing (specific IgE measurement, skin prick tests, and oral food challenges), and the timing and approaches for introduction of peanut-containing foods in the health care provider's office or at home. The addendum guidelines provide the background, rationale, and strength of evidence for each recommendation. Conclusions: Guidelines have been developed for early introduction of peanut-containing foods into the diets of infants at various risk levels for peanut allergy.

It is traditionally challenging to implement higher-order PWM closed-loop Class-D audio amplifiers using analog intensive techniques in deep-submicron, low voltage process technologies. This is primarily attributed to reduced power supply, degraded analog transistor characteristics, including short-channel effects, increased flicker noise, random telegraph noise, transistor reliability concerns and passive component performance. In this paper, we introduce a global closed-loop mixed-signal architecture incorporating digital control and integrate a fourth-order amplifier prototype in 55 nm CMOS. A systematic approach to analyze, design and compensate the feedback loop in the digital domain is also presented. The versatility of implementing the loop gain poles and zeros digitally attains high gain throughout the audio band and attenuates residual high frequency ripples around the loop, simultaneously accomplishing improvements in THD+ N and PSRR. The overall architecture is inherently amenable to implementation in deep-submicron and is therefore compatible with scaled CMOS. The measured prototype achieves a high 105 dBA SNR, 0.0031% THD+ N, 92 dB PSRR and 85% efficiency when supplying 1 W into emulated 8 speaker load. This performance is competitive with conventional designs using large feature size precision CMOS or specialized BCD technologies and reports the highest output power (1.5 W) for deep-submicron designs.	1.4
Using a pattern-based approach, worry was explored in relation to military youths' developmental and contextual characteristics, and pivotal outcomes (depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, well-being, coping styles, academic performance and deployment adjustment). Data were collected from parents and adolescents, age 11 to 18, living in the USA (n = 273 families). Variations in individual characteristics (age and gender), military family factors (rank, recent deployment, parents' resilient coping abilities) and family relational characteristics (parents' marital status, warm parenting, marital quality) were related to heterogeneous worry typologies. Depressive symptoms, self-efficacy and well-being, varied across the worry typologies. Implications are drawn from these findings for identifying potential interventions that can be accessed to modify these worry patterns and limit their harmful effects.	5.4
Active Contour Models (ACM) have been widely used for segmentation in many computer vision applications. These models are defined by an energy functional attached to an initial curve that evolves under some constraints to extract desired objects in the image. New models are proposed, and existing techniques are investigated and improved in different domains. Among these ACM, Balloon ACM is an edge-based model that adds a normal force as constraint making the curve to have more dynamic behaviors and more effectiveness in detecting objects boundary. However, some problems have been pointed out including segmentation of complex shape and high runtime processing. In this paper, we develop a new method -called Fast Adaptive Balloon (FAB)-sufficient to segment complex shape with lower computational complexity. The proposed definition for balloon force achieves satisfactory segmentation performance compared with other ACMs using both synthetic and medical images in two dimension. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness in segmentation besides the convergence speed.	0.0
The aim was to investigate dentin bond strength of two resin-ceramic materials and five cements after 24 h and six months storage. Cylinders (n=15/group) of Lava Ultimate (3M ESPE) and VITA ENAMIC (VITA Zahnfabrik) were cemented to mid-coronal dentin of 300 extracted human molars with RelyX Ultimate (3M ESPE), PANAVIA F2.0 (Kuraray), Variolink II (Ivoclar Vivadent), els cem (Saremco Dental), or Ketac Cem Plus (3M ESPE). Shear bond strength (SBS) was measured after 24 h or six months storage (37 degrees C, 100% humidity) and statistically analyzed (significance level: alpha=0.05). SBS varied markedly between Lava Ultimate and VITA ENAMIC, between the five cements, and between storage of either 24 h or six months. After six months, SBS was highest when Lava Ultimate was cemented with RelyX Ultimate and when VITA ENAMIC was cemented with RelyX Ultimate or with Variolink II. Lava Ultimate was somewhat more sensitive to storage than was VITA ENAMIC.	3.0
A solar thermal and heat pump combisystem is one of many system alternatives on the market for supplying domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) in dwellings. In this study a reference solar thermal and air source heat pump combisystem was defined and modelled based on products available on the market. Based on the results of an extensive literature survey, several system variations were investigated to show the influence of heat pump cycle, thermal storage and system integration on the use of electricity for two houses in the climates of Zurich and Carcassonne. A singular economic cash flow analysis was carried out and the additional investment limit of each system variation was determined for a range of economic boundary conditions. This is the maximum extra investment cost for the system variant compared to the reference system that will give a break even result for a 10 year period. The results show that variations in electricity price affects the additional investment limit far more than the other economic parameters. Several of the variants show potential for achieving a cost benefit, but the potential varies a lot depending on load and climate boundary conditions. For all variants, the biggest difference in electricity savings was found for Zurich rather than in Carcassonne, which is explained by the larger heating load. However, in three cases the largest savings were for the SFH45 house despite the fact that the annual electricity use of the system is much lower than that for the SFH100 house, 3581 kW h/year compared to 8340 kW h/year. This was attributed to the fact that, in these cases, the operating level of the space heating circuit played a significant role, the SFH45 house being supplied with a 35/30 degrees C heating system while the SFH100 was supplied with a 55/45 degrees C heating system.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common infection in critically ill patients. Initial antibiotic therapy is often broad spectrum, which promotes antibiotic resistance so new techniques are under investigation to obtain early microbiological identification and quantification. This trial compares the performance of a new real-time quantitative molecular-based method with conventional culture in patients with suspected VAP. Patients with suspected VAP who were ventilated for at least 48 h were eligible. An endotracheal aspirate (ETA) and a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed at each suspected VAP episode. Both samples were analysed by conventional culture and molecular analysis. For the latter, bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample and real-time PCR were run. In all, 120 patients were finally included; 76% (91) were men; median age was 65 years, and clinical pulmonary infection score was >= 6 for 73.5% (86) of patients. A total of 120 BAL and 103 ETA could be processed and culture results above the agreed threshold were obtained for 75.0% (90/120) of BAL and 60.2% (62/103) of ETA. The main isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. Performancewas 89.2% (83.2% e93.6%) sensitivity and 97.1% (96.1% e97.9%) specificity for BAL samples and 71.8% (61.0% e81.0%) sensitivity and 96.6% (95.4% e97.5%) specificity for ETA samples when the molecular biology method was compared with conventional culture method (chosen as reference standard). This new molecular method can provide reliable quantitative microbiological data and is highly specific with good sensitivity for common pathogens involved in VAP.

An understanding of thermal hydraulics, its basic phenomena, and its application to nuclear power plants is vital to safe as well as efficient design and operation. Thermal hydraulics for two-phase flow and heat transfer with nuclear applications has been studied for roughly 50 years, and the current body of knowledge is extensive. Yet, there remain safety issues, and the licensing of new light water reactor designs or new analysis methodologies is rarely simple. This is due to the state of the art in reactor thermal hydraulics as well as the perspective that the regulator, in this case the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), has toward that field of study. This paper discusses the state of the art in nuclear thermal hydraulics, the regulator's unique role and perspective, and a view of current challenges. The discussion is meant to point out how the regulator's perspective has been shaped and hopefully provide some guidance on fulfilling research needs for future applications that may need NRC review.	3.1
Understanding the dynamics of mental health of recently resettled refugees is an essential component of any comprehensive resettlement program, yet establishing the components of a successful and acceptable mental health intervention is an elusive task. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 resettled refugees from five countries who had received treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms, or anxiety. Themes generated from the interviews emphasized the need for strong group-based social support as well as a focus on practical needs such as acquiring and maintaining employment, language and literacy training, and access to care.	5.4
How organisms respond to climate change during the winter depends on snow cover, because the subnivium (the insulated and thermally stable area between snowpack and frozen ground) provides a refuge for plants, animals, and microbes. Satellite data characterizing either freeze/thaw cycles or snow cover are both available, but these two types of data have not yet been combined to map the subnivium. Here, we characterized global patterns of frozen ground with and without snow cover to provide a baseline to assess the effects of future winter climate change on organisms that depend on the subnivium. We analyzed two remote sensing datasets: the MODIS Snow Cover product and the NASA MEaSUREs Global Record of Daily Landscape Freeze/fhaw Status dataset derived from SSM/I and SSMIS. From these we developed a new 500-m resolution dataset that captures global patterns of the duration of snow-covered ground (D-ws) and the duration of snow-free frozen ground (D-wos) from 2000 to 2012. We also quantified how D-ws and D-wos, vary with latitude. Our results show that both mean and interannual variation in D-ws and D-wos change with latitude and topography. Mean D-ws increases with latitude. Counter-intuitively though, D-wos has longest duration at about 33 degrees N, decreasing both northward and southward, even though the duration of frozen ground (either snow covered or not) was shorter than that at higher latitudes. This occurs because snow cover in mid-latitudes is low and ephemeral, leaving longer periods of frozen, snow-free ground. Interannual variation in D-ws increased with latitude, but the slopes of this relationship differed among North America, Europe, Asia, and the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, our results show that, for organisms that rely on the subnivium to survive the winter, mid-latitude areas could be functionally colder than either higher or lower latitudes. Furthermore, because interannual variation in D-wos is greater at high latitudes, we would expect organisms there to be adapted to unpredictability in exposure to freezing. Ultimately, the effects of climate change on organisms during winter should be considered in the context of the subnivium, when warming could make more northerly areas functionally colder in winter, and changes in annual variation in the duration of snow-free but frozen conditions could lead to greater unpredictability in the onset and end of winter.

The timing of introduction of solid food on the subsequent development of food allergy is under debate and the role of concurrent breastfeeding is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of solid food introduction whilst concurrently breastfeeding on food allergy outcome, with a specific focus on cows' milk allergy. Prospectively collected infant feeding data from a birth cohort were analysed. Participants with histories suggestive of food allergy underwent diagnostic food challenges. Children with food allergy were matched to control participants for age and sex. Mann-Whitney U tests, chi(2), Fisher exact tests and logistic regression calculations were undertaken. A total of thirty-nine food-allergic children and seventy-eight matched controls were identified, including twenty-two cows' milk-allergic children and forty-four matched controls. The control group introduced solid food earlier than the food-allergic group ( P < 0.05). There was no effect of concurrent breastfeeding alongside cows' milk introduction or other food allergens on the development of food allergy. Due to small numbers, it was not possible to explore differences for food allergy phenotype. We have therefore found no evidence that introducing solids, or food allergens, whilst breastfeeding has an allergy-preventative effect; however, the results should be interpreted with caution due to sample size. Recommendations regarding infant feeding and food allergy should be carefully considered. Although breastfeeding should be promoted for many health reasons, larger studies looking at the introduction of food allergens on the development of food allergy are needed to make a final conclusion.	5.1
We study the problem of inverse minimum dynamic cut (IMDC), which changes a capacity vector u in such a way that a given dynamic cut and the applied changes are minimum, using the Euclidean norm l(1) to measure these changes. Our aim is to solve an inverse minimum dynamic cut, by finding a maximum dynamic flow in a time-expanded network flow and, having calculated the appropriate algorithm, analyzing the relationships between the time-expanded networks, the maximum flow, and the minimum cut. First, we show a specified dynamic cut, to be optimized; the capacity of arcs should be reduced. This study is useful in cases where the network should be divided into two parts by cutting such that this cut has the minimum weight. It is applicable in physics, chemistry, computer networks and electrical circuits, etc. The advantage of this method is the use of time-expanded network to be static corresponding to a dynamic network and algorithm is easily displayed on this network. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on a numerical example of dynamic network flow.	1.2
In this paper, we study the well-posedness and stability analysis of set-valued Lur'e dynamical systems in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The existence and uniqueness results are established under the so-called passivity condition. Our approach uses a regularization procedure for the term involving the maximal monotone operator. The Lyapunov stability as well as the invariance properties are considered in detail. In addition, we give some sufficient conditions ensuring the robust stability of the system in finite-dimensional spaces. The theoretical developments are illustrated by means of two examples dealing with nonregular electrical circuits and an other one in partial differential equations. Our methodology is based on tools from set-valued and variational analysis.	1.2
Integrated hydrological, geophysical and groundwater modeling studies has been carried out for identification of suitable sites for rainwater harvesting structures for groundwater augmentation in RRCAT Campus, Indore, M.P. Based on these studies ten check dams, two contour bunds and one earthen bund were recommended on the existing stream channels and in valley fills respectively. Likely water impoundment on these structures was calculated keeping in view the length and width of stream channels. Based on these study a groundwater flow model using MODFLOW were carried out keeping in view the geologic and hydrologic conditions of the area. The net rechargeable impounded rain water from these structures to groundwater regime was calculated for monsoon seasons which varied from 20 % to 48 % and net enhancement of groundwater recharge from all structures would be around 0.11 mcm/year and the water level in the existing well would rise by 2-3 m above its present level for future Groundwater augmentation.	4.3
The objectives of this study are to describe prescribing practices, to evaluate their appropriateness and their compliance with guidelines and to examine their influencing factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study of antibiotic prescriptions data of 105 patients in the medical and surgical Emergency Department of the Military Hospital of Instruction Mohammed V in Rabat over a period of one month. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire including demographic and anamnestic data, patient's history, allergies, specific clinical examination data, paraclinical data, detailed antibiotic prescription. Collected data were then evaluated by a referring physician, who was responsible for detecting any treatment error. Among infections requiring the prescription of antibiotics, respiratory and urinary system diseases were at the forefront, the most commonly used antibiotic families were penicillins, quinolones and cephalosporins. 74 prescriptions (70.5%) were both pertinent and compliant versus 9 prescriptions (8.6%) justified but nonpertinent and 6 prescriptions (5.7%) which were considered unjustified by the referring physician due to absence of infection. The evaluation of the existing medical practice is rarely conducted in health facilities; with this in mind, our case study aims to improve appropriate antibiotic prescribing and to optimize its compliance with guidelines.	5.1
Gas liquid two phase flows are widely encountered in industry. The design parameters include two phase pressure drop, mixing and axial mixing in both the phases, effective interfacial area, heat and mass transfer coefficients. Currently, there is a high degree of empiricism in the design process of such reactors owing to the complexity of coupled flow and reaction mechanism. Hence, we focus on synthesizing recent advances in computational and experimental techniques that will enable future designs of such reactors in a more rational manner by exploring a large design space with high-fidelity models (computational fluid dynamics) that are validated with high-fidelity measurements (hot film anemometry (HFA), Laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), particle image velocimetry (Ply), etc.) to provide a high degree of rigor. Understanding the spatial distributions of dispersed phases and their interaction during scale up are key challenges that were traditionally addressed through pilot scale experiments, but now can be addressed through advanced modelling. For practically complete knowledge of the fluid mechanical parameters, it is desirable to implement direct numerical simulations (DNS). However, the current computational power does not permit full DNS for real bubble columns. Therefore, we have been using simplified turbulence models (such as large eddy simulation, Reynolds stress, k-epsilon, etc.) which need the knowledge of turbulence parameters. For the estimation of these parameters, currently semi-empirical procedures are being used pending the knowledge of turbulence. Further, the formulation of governing equations in all the CFD models (except DNS), the knowledge of interface forces (drag, lift, virtual mass, Basset, etc.) is needed and for their estimations empirical correlations are being employed, again pending the knowledge of fluid mechanics under turbulent conditions in bubble columns. In gas liquid dispersions, the gas is sparged in the form of bubbles. During the bubble rise, the mechanism of wake detachment creates turbulence which can be called as wake generated turbulence. In addition, energy gets transferred from the gas phase to liquid phase. The quantitative amounts are negligible when bubble motion is not hindered and the gas liquid dispersion is homogenous. The amounts increase with an increase in the extent of hindrance. However, in the homogenous regime, even under extreme conditions, the extent of energy transfer in the bulk gas liquid dispersions (volume other than wake volume) is fairly limited. On contrast, in the heterogeneous regime, the rates of energy transfer become sizeable. The energy received by the liquid (in both the regimes) also creates turbulent motion and termed as bulk generated turbulence. In turbulent flows a compendium of eddies (flow structures) of different length and time scales contribute towards improved/enhanced mixing, momentum transfer, heat transfer, and mass transfer (transport phenomena). Hence, a proper understanding of the dynamics of these turbulent flow structures, and their role in the transport phenomena, can bring substantial improvement in the scale-up and design procedures. The present paper brings out the current status of knowledge on bubble generated turbulence. All the published literature in experimental measurements and DNS simulations has been critically analysed and coherently presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.4
Objective: Prospective study designs ideally allow patients to be followed from the first manifestations of the illness or even from an at-risk stage. It can thus provide data on the predictive value of changes in clinical symptomatology, cognition or further biological markers to broaden our understanding of the etiopathology and symptomatic trajectory of bipolar disorders. The scope of this narrative review is to summarize evidence from prospectively collected data on psychopathological and other clinical and biological changes in the early developmental course of bipolar disorders. Methods: The narrative review was based on a literature search conducted in February 2016 within the PubMed library for prospective study data of persons in antecedent and early manifest stages of manifest bipolar disorder published within the last 15years. Results: A total of 19 prospective studies were included. Regarding psychopathological features; personality, temperament and character traits as well as changes in sleep and circadian rhythm, the evidence suggests that risk factors for the development of bipolar disorder can already be described and should be studied further to understand their interaction, mediation with other factors and timing in the developmental process of bipolar disorder. Apart from the positive family history, childhood anxiety, sleep problems, subthreshold (hypo)manic symptoms and certain character traits/emotionality should be identified and monitored already in clinical practice as their presence likely increases risk of bipolar disorder. Up to date no substantiated evidence was found from prospective studies addressing cognitive features, life events, immunological parameters and morphological central nervous system changes as potential risk factors for bipolar disorder. Conclusion: For an improved understanding of episodic disorders, longitudinal data collection is essential. Since the etiology of bipolar disorders is complex, a number of potential risk factors have been proposed. Prospective studies addressing this spectrum and resilience factors are critical and will be best conducted within multi-site research networks or initiatives.	5.4

This paper proposes and implements a new single-phase magnetless flux switching machine (FSM) for rooftop wind power generation. The key is to integrate an outer-rotor FSM and an inner-rotor FSM with shared stator yoke and stator drum windings. In such a way, this proposed machine can not only realize flux switching function to regulate magnetic flux effectively, but also incorporate the field and armature windings within one stator to reduce the copper losses and improve the overall machine efficiency. Meanwhile, the structure is compact and rotors can be directly driven by blades to capture the wind power. The machine design guidelines from both magnetic and electric aspects are illustrated, the machine characteristics are analyzed by using time-stepping finite-element method, and the system performances are evaluated based on mathematical modeling. Both simulation and prototyping test are conducted to verify the validity of the proposed machine and system.	3.3
Random numbers are highly used in applications like computer simulation, gambling, statistical sampling and cryptography. Only a high-entropy random source can produce a better quality of random data. In this paper, we work on the generation of high-quality random numbers based on cellular automata (CA). We propose three-dimensional (3D) CA to generate a random sequence. We also propose various enhancements to CA-based pseudorandom number generator (CA-PRNG) and discuss its five variants by using two-dimensional (2D) and 3D CA. We analyze the switching between 2D and 3D CA for the same sequence to achieve high-quality randomness. We provide the architectures, CA rules and the algorithms for all the proposed variants with respect to 2D and 3D cell structures. We have done a software implementation of all the proposed variants and tested their produced sequences by using the internationally accepted standard for random numbers known as DIEHARD. The analysis of our results is made as per the recommendations of ANSI standards. A very similar criteria are applied to compare all the methods. Based on our results we are able to find the best CA-PRNG for producing high-quality random sequence.	0.3
By using GHZ-like states and entanglement swapping, Kang et al. [Chin. Phys. B 24 (2015) 090306] proposed a controlled mutual quantum entity authentication protocol. We find that the proposed protocol is not secure, that is, the center, Charlie can eavesdrop the secret keys shared between Alice and Bob without being detected.	0.3

The purpose of this paper is to analyze how different definitions and methods for delineating the spatial boundaries of cities have an impact on the values of city sustainability indicators. It is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities fromt he outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. For this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. Although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. Those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. These methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. Furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. For example, the average values of CO2 emissions per capita and PM10 concentration in citieswithmore than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. When analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. It is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policymaking. Otherwise, ineffective and inefficient policies will be developed.

In this paper, we introduce the analysis and the design of a new web-based interactive software tool, called WebUbu, which has been developed to serve the undergraduate students' needs related to Linux Operating System (OS) issues. The aim of this software development was twofold: on the one hand to familiarize students with Ubuntu OS environment and, on the other hand to promote the self-learning related to this Linux distribution, in the context of everyday OS classrooms. WbUbu software can be used only for interactive demonstration of features of Linux during lectures and to support instructors for evaluation of students' skills in the lab. For other tasks such as long term studying of Linux-based OS's physical' Linux must be used. Our software is essentially a website that simulates Ubuntu operating system inside a web browser. Undergraduate students can easily explore both graphical user interface (GUI) and command line of Ubuntu's environment. Additionally, students can ascertain the acquired knowledge through an automated examination process and learn from their mistakes as they shown automatically by the software in real time. Educator can manage students' performances that are stored in a database system and assess the individual's cognitive progress resulting from the software contribution. However, WebUbu will give students the chance for practice and self assessment when they not involved in the University's educational process or physical' Linux is unavailable. That software intends to complement the existing teaching and learning methods concerning Operating Systems. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	0.4

The shape of a sediment particle can reveal part of the particle's transportation history and is a significant variable in sediment transport mechanics. Measuring sediment shapes is a difficult and time-consuming task. A whole sample sediment particle shape quantitative analysis method (WSQAM) was applied in this research for sediment statistical analysis. The shape parameter was found using sphericity and roundness descriptors: three samples were collected from the middle reach of the Yellow River at different depths. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain sediment particles images. The sphericity and roundness descriptors were represented by the particle aspect ratio (AR) and the Fourier shape coefficient (FSC). The Fourier series approximation matched the particle outlines. From the statistical results of the whole sediment particle sample, as counted by WSQAM based on digital image processing, fine sediment particles with smooth surfaces accounted for approximately 80% of all of the observed sediment particles. For the majority of sediment particles, AR was greater than 0.3 and FSC was less than 0.1. When AR was greater than 0.5, FSC exponentially decayed with AR. When AR was less than 0.5, the two parameters, AR and FSC, should be combined to describe the sediment particle shape. The combined use of these two parameters can provide a reference for future sediment-related calculations. The sediment particle shape analysis model, programmed in Fortran, was rapid and flexible. It proved efficient to use WSQAM for sediment statistical analysis, and the results were found to be accurate.

Johne's disease, caused by infection with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), is a chronic wasting disease of ruminants. Hallmark symptoms of clinical Johne's disease include diarrhea, progressive weight loss, and premature death; symptoms due largely to chronic inflammation in the small intestine. MAP colonizes resident macrophages within the ileum of the small intestine, subsequently establishing a persistent infection in the host. It has been proposed that regulatory T cells may play a role in the progression of Johne's disease, either through promotion of tolerance to MAP or via a loss in homeostasis that subsequently allows widespread inflammation. In this report, we evaluated the presence of Tregs, as well as other immune parameters, in the ileum and draining lymph nodes of MAP associated lesions. A lesion classification scheme was developed to categorize severity of MAP-induced lesions within infected tissues and subsequently regulatory T cell presence and overall immune activity were assessed corresponding to lesions of varying severity, in comparison to tissues from healthy control animals. Our results revealed a relationship between animal health and overall lesion severity within the infected tissues, as well as a relationship between bacterial burden and severity of pathology. Regulatory T cell abundance was shown to decrease with increasing lesion severity. Within the ileum, the expression of many Th1, Th2, and Treg-associated genes increased in mild lesions and decreased in severe lesions, whereas in the lymph nodes the expression of these genes tended to increase with increasing lesion severity. Based on our results, we conclude that a local loss of T cell (including Treg) activity occurs within severe Heal lesions associated with MAP, resulting in a loss of homeostasis that ultimately leads to the progression of clinical Johne's disease.

Although frequency-specific network analyses have shown that functional brain networks are altered in patients with Alzheimer's disease, the relationships between these frequency-specific network alterations remain largely unknown. Multiplex network analysis is a novel network approach to study complex systems consisting of subsystems with different types of connectivity patterns. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography to integrate five frequency-band specific brain networks in a multiplex framework. Previous structural and functional brain network studies have consistently shown that hub brain areas are selectively disrupted in Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, we hypothesized that hub regions in the multiplex brain networks are selectively targeted in patients with Alzheimer's disease in comparison to healthy control subjects. Eyes-closed resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings from 27 patients with Alzheimer's disease (60.6 +/- 5.4 years, 12 females) and 26 controls (61.8 +/- 5.5 years, 14 females) were projected onto atlas-based regions of interest using beamforming. Subsequently, source-space time series for both 78 cortical and 12 subcortical regions were reconstructed in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta band). Multiplex brain networks were constructed by integrating frequency-specific magnetoencephalography networks. Functional connections between all pairs of regions of interests were quantified using a phase-based coupling metric, the phase lag index. Several multiplex hub and heterogeneity metrics were computed to capture both overall importance of each brain area and heterogeneity of the connectivity patterns across frequency-specific layers. Different nodal centrality metrics showed consistently that several hub regions, particularly left hippocampus, posterior parts of the default mode network and occipital regions, were vulnerable in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to control subjects. Of note, these detected vulnerable hubs in Alzheimer's disease were absent in each individual frequency-specific network, thus showing the value of integrating the networks. The connectivity patterns of these vulnerable hub regions in the patients were heterogeneously distributed across layers. Perturbed cognitive function and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta(42) levels correlated positively with the vulnerability of the hub regions in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Our analysis therefore demonstrates that the magnetoencephalography-based multiplex brain networks contain important information that cannot be revealed by frequency-specific brain networks. Furthermore, this indicates that functional networks obtained in different frequency bands do not act as independent entities. Overall, our multiplex network study provides an effective framework to integrate the frequency-specific networks with different frequency patterns and reveal neuropathological mechanism of hub disruption in Alzheimer's disease.	5.2
National media consumer panels were conducted in Taiwan to examine how the first-person and third-person perceptions would mediate the impacts of celebrity credibility on advertising skepticism. Results revealed that (a) the third-person perceptions took place in the context of celebrity-endorsed advertising; (b) all three credibility variables were negatively correlated to advertising skepticism, but only celebrity attractiveness and expertise yielded direct effects; (c) indirect effects by the first-person perceptions were stronger than those by the third-person perceptions on advertising skepticism. Theoretical and practical implication insights were discussed to indicate that Taiwanese consumers did not want to be recognized as celebrity followers for a self-enhancement purpose. However, their first-person perceptions played a more active role than their third-person perceptions in mediating their perceived celebrity credibility and diminishing their skepticism toward celebrity-endorsed advertising.	2.2
Theoretical studies of pollution haven hypothesis predict that differentiated environmental regulation policies will result in inter-country relocation of polluting industries. This paper investigates pollution haven hypothesis at domestic level in China. Using panel data of 30 provincial level regions for the period 2004 to 2013, this paper empirically examines to what extent multiple environmental policies affect intra-country relocation of polluting industries in China. It is found that the implementation of both economic policy instrument like pollution discharge fee and public participation like letter complaints on environmental problems encourages industrial relocation, whereas the implementation of environmental legal policy instrument like laws, regulations and rules prevents polluting industries from relocating to other regions. It is also found that the relocation effect of environmental policies varies with industrial characteristics. Compared with water pollution-intensive industry, air pollution-intensive industry dominated by stated-owned capitals are insensitive to legal policy instruments. These findings suggest that the validity of pollution haven hypothesis is jointly associated with the type of environmental policy as well as industrial characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

ion is a useful process for broadening mental horizons, integrating new experiences, and communicating information to others. Much attention has been directed at identifying the causes and consequences of abstraction across the subdisciplines of psychology. Despite this attention, an integrative review of the methods that are used for studying abstraction is missing from the literature. The current article aims to fill this gap in several ways. First, we highlight the different ways in which abstraction has been defined in the literature and then suggest an integrative definition. Second, we provide a tour of the different ways abstraction has been manipulated and measured over the years. Finally, we highlight considerations for researchers in choosing methods for their own research.	2.2
Most psychotherapists and researchers agree that a good relationship essentially contributes to therapeutic change. The psychoanalytic concepts transference and countertransference which describe fundamental aspects of the psychotherapeutic relationship have now become integrated into behavior therapy. These concepts, however, are used differently in psychoanalysis as well as in behavior therapy. This makes the communication between psychotherapists coming from different orientations difficult. Therefore, a research approach which describes the important verbal and nonverbal elements of a helpful therapeutic interaction independently from therapeutic orientation could help to evaluate their effectiveness in different psychotherapeutic methods. In this way a culture of integration into psychotherapy could be encouraged.	2.3
Background: One in twenty-five people suffer from a mood disorder. Current treatments are sub-optimal with poor patient response and uncertain modes-of-action. There is thus a need to better understand underlying mechanisms that determine mood, and how these go wrong in affective disorders. Systems biology approaches have yielded important biological discoveries for other complex diseases such as cancer, and their potential in affective disorders will be reviewed. Scope of review: This review will provide a general background to affective disorders, plus an outline of experimental and computational systems biology. The current application of these approaches in understanding affective disorders will be considered, and future recommendations made. Major conclusions: Experimental systems biology has been applied to the study of affective disorders, especially at the genome and transcriptomic levels. However, data generation has been slowed by a lack of human tissue or suitable animal models. At present, computational systems biology has only be applied to understanding affective disorders on a few occasions. These studies provide sufficient novel biological insight to motivate further use of computational biology in this field. General significance: In common with many complex diseases much time and money has been spent on the generation of large-scale experimental datasets. The next step is to use the emerging computational approaches, predominantly developed in the field of oncology, to leverage the most biological insight from these datasets. This will lead to the critical breakthroughs required for more effective diagnosis, stratification and treatment of affective disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	6.0
Due to frequent droughts and rapid population growth in urban areas, the adoption of practices to reduce the usage of fresh water is on the rise. Reduction in usage of fresh water can be achieved through various local water management practices (WMP) such as Water Demand Management (WDM) and use of alternative water sources such as Greywater Recycling (GR) and Rainwater Harvesting (RH). While the positive effects of WMPs have been widely acknowledged, the implementation of WMPs is also likely to lower the wastewater flow and increase the concentration of contaminants in sewage. These in turn can lead to increases in sewer problems such as odour and corrosion. This paper analyses impacts of various WMP scenarios on wastewater flow and contaminant load. The Urban Volume and Quality (UVQ) model was used to simulate wastewater flow and the associated wastewater contaminants from different WMP scenarios. The wastewater parameters investigated were those which influence odour and corrosion problems in sewerage networks due to the formation of hydrogen sulphide. These parameters are: chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate (NO3-), sulphate (SO42-), sulphide (S2-) and iron (Fe) that were contributed by the households (not including the biochemical process in sewer pipe). The results will help to quantify the impact of WMP scenarios on odour and corrosion in sewerage pipe networks. Results show that the implementation of a combination of WDM and GR had highly increased the concentration of all selected contaminant that triggered the formation of hydrogen sulphide, namely COD, sulphate and sulphide. On the other hand, the RH scenario had the least increase in the concentration of the contaminants, except iron concentrations. The increase in iron concentrations is actually beneficial because it inhibits the formation of hydrogen sulphide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.3
AimInterleukin 23 (IL-23) and its receptor (IL-23R) seem to play a major role in differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells, induction of IL-17 production, and activation of inflammatory pathways. Recent studies have suggested the association of IL-23R polymorphisms with bone and articular inflammation in diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the association between IL-23R polymorphisms and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). MethodA case-control study on 55 patients with JIA and 78 healthy controls was performed. All samples were genotyped for eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL23R (rs1004819, rs2201841, rs10889677, rs1495965, rs7517847, rs10489629, rs11209026 and rs1343151), using real-time polymerase chain reaction Taqman genotyping technique. Forty-two patients and 42 healthy controls were chosen randomly to measure the level of serum IL-17A using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ResultsAlthough the heterozygous genotype of rs1004819 (GA) showed a weak, but statistically significant protective effect on polyarticular subtype (P=0.03), none of the selected SNPs were associated with JIA overall. Indeed the analysis of haplotypes did not show any significant association with JIA. Serum IL-17A level was not significantly different among patients and healthy controls and between JIA subtypes, as well. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between SNPs and serum IL-17A concentration. ConclusionThis is the first study of the IL-23R gene in Iranian patients with JIA. Our results did not show any strong association between IL-23R polymorphisms and JIA disease or serum IL-17A levels. The only association was seen between rs1004819 and polyarticular JIA. Further larger studies may help clarify the role, if any, of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of JIA.	5.3
This study proposed a novel method to extract endmembers from hyperspectral image based on discrete firefly algorithm (EE-DFA). Endmembers are the input of many spectral unmixing algorithms. Hence, in this paper, endmember extraction from hyperspectral image is regarded as a combinational optimization problem to get best spectral unmixing results, which can be solved by the discrete firefly algorithm. Two series of experiments were conducted on the synthetic hyperspectral datasets with different SNR and the AVIRIS Cuprite dataset, respectively. The experimental results were compared with the endmembers extracted by four popular methods: the sequential maximum angle convex cone (SMACC), N-FINDR, Vertex Component Analysis (VCA), and Minimum Volume Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (MVC-NMF). What's more, the effect of the parameters in the proposed method was tested on both synthetic hyperspectral datasets and AVIRIS Cuprite dataset, and the recommended parameters setting was proposed. The results in this study demonstrated that the proposed EE-DFA method showed better performance than the existing popular methods. Moreover, EE-DFA is robust under different SNR conditions.

Studies in vivo and in vitro have suggested that the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathogenesis is initiated by an interaction between the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta o). This PrPC-A beta o complex activates Fyn kinase which, in turn, hyperphosphorylates tau (P-Tau) resulting in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. AD transgenic mice lacking PrPC accumulate A beta, but show normal survival and no loss of spatial learning and memory suggesting that PrPC functions downstream of A beta o production but upstream of intracellular toxicity within neurons. Since AD and traumatic brain injury (TBI)linked chronic traumatic encephalopathy are tauopathies, we examined whether similar mechanistic pathways are responsible for both AD and TBI pathophysiologies. Using transgenic mice expressing different levels of PrPC, our studies investigated the influence and necessity of PrPC on biomarker (total-tau [T-Tau], P-Tau, GFAP) levels in brain and blood as measured biochemically following severe TBI in the form of severe closed head injury (sCHI). We found that following sCHI, increasing levels of T-Tau and P-Tau in the brain were associated with the PrPC expression levels. A similar relationship between PrPC expression and P-Tau levels following sCHI were found in blood in the absence of significant T-Tau changes. This effect was not seen with GFAP which increased within 24 h following sCHI and progressively decreased by the 7 day time point regardless of the PrPC expression levels. Changes in the levels of all biomarkers were independent of gender. We further enhanced and expanded the quantitation of brain biomarkers with correlative studies using immunohisochemistry. We also demonstrate that a TBI-induced calpain hyperactivation is not required for the generation of P-Tau. A relationship was demonstrated between the presence/absence of PrPC, the levels of P-Tau and cognitive dysfunction. Our studies suggest that PrPC is important in mediating TBI related pathology.	5.2
It might seem a reasonable assumption that when we are not actively using our faces to express ourselves (i.e., when we display nonexpressive, or neutral faces), those around us will not be able to read our emotions. Herein, using a variety of expression-related ratings, we examined whether age-related changes in the face can accurately reveal one's innermost affective dispositions. In each study, we found that expressive ratings of neutral facial displays predicted self-reported positive/negative dispositional affect, but only for elderly women, and only for positive affect. These findings meaningfully replicate and extend earlier work examining age related emotion cues in the face of elderly women (Malatesta et al., 1987a). We discuss these findings in light of evidence that women are expected to, and do, smile more than men, and that the quality of their smiles predicts their life satisfaction. Although ratings of old male faces did not significantly predict self-reported affective dispositions, the trend was similar to that found for old female faces. A plausible explanation for this gender difference is that in the process of attenuating emotional expressions over their lifetimes, old men reveal less evidence of their total emotional experiences in their faces than do old women.	2.2
The common approach used in the thermal design of electrical machines is calibrating thermal models based on the designer's previous experience, or hardware tests on a prototype machine. This allows for various manufacture and assembly nuances to be accounted for in the design process, assuring accurate and computationally efficient predictions of the machine thermal behaviour. The post-manufacture calibration of thermal models from tests on a complete machine has limited use in development of machine topologies, where no previous experience or machine hardware exist. In this context, an experiment informed design technique that makes use of reduced order machine sub-assemblies presents an attractive alternative. In particular, the hardware manufacture cost and time is significantly reduced compared to the prototyping of the complete machine assembly. This allows for numerous hardware samples to be constructed and tested, to inform the machine design process. The use of the machine sub-assembly testing is focused, but not limited to identifying and quantifying various power loss and heat transfer phenomena. This paper reviews the applicability of the sub-assembly testing in a broader context of the machine design. The aim of the research focuses on formulating a basis for sub-assembly based, experiment informed methodology for the thermal design of electrical machines.	3.3
The thermal diode is the fundamental device for phononics. There are various mechanisms for thermal rectification, e.g. different temperature dependent thermal conductivity of two ends, asymmetric interfacial resistance, and nonlocal behavior of phonon transport in asymmetric structures. The phonon hydrodynamics and thermomass theory treat the heat conduction in a fluidic viewpoint. The phonon gas flowing through the media is characterized by the balance equation of momentum, like the Navier-Stokes equation for fluid mechanics. Generalized heat conduction law thereby contains the spatial acceleration (convection) term and the viscous (Laplacian) term. The viscous term predicts the size dependent thermal conductivity. Rectification appears due to the MFP supersession of phonons. The convection term also predicts rectification because of the inertia effect, like a gas passing through a nozzle or diffuser.	3.4
The Switched Reluctance Machine (SRM) offers advantages over other topologies, but low torque density, high torque ripple, and use of a non-standard power converter are limitations. This paper develops a drive configuration which facilitates the operation of a six-phase SRM using a standard three-phase inverter in order to address these limitations. The focus of the paper is an investigation of electromagnetic design aspects of two candidate SRM topologies in this six-phase context for a pure electric or hybrid electric vehicle type application. Advances are made in the understanding of the electromagnetic design of suitable SRMs, and the conventional SRM is demonstrated as the preferred topology through parametric and FEA design studies with reference to a given specification. Initial laboratory test results for a prototype machine are presented in demonstration of this drive concept and verification of the machine design.	3.3
Recent studies have reported an unusually high frequency of nonamplifying alleles at microsatellite loci in bivalves. Null alleles have been associated with heterozygous deficits in many studies. While several studies have tested for its presence using different analytical tools, few have empirically tested for its consequences in estimating population structure and differentiation. We characterised 16 newly developed microsatellite loci and show that null alleles are ubiquitous in the wedge clam, Donax trunculus. We carried out several tests to demonstrate that the large heterozygous deficits observed in the newly characterised loci were most likely due to null alleles. Wetested the robustness of microsatellite genotyping for population assignment by showing that well-recognised biogeographic regions of the south Atlantic and south Mediterranean coast of Spain harbour genetically different populations.	6.4
Recent advances in technologies such as high density array-based genotyping, DNA and RNA deep sequencing, expression quantitative-trait loci mapping, epigenome analyses, and new computational strategies, have introduced drastic shifts into our understanding of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) association with immune-mediated diseases. Here, we review the most exciting findings in this field. We show how the fine characterization of structural features and expression levels ofMHCalleles, posttranslational or environmental modifications of HLA-bound peptides, and epistatic interactions with non-HLA genes, has made it possible not only to provide mechanistic explanations for MHC associations with immune-mediated diseases but also to help choose relevant therapeutic targets.	5.3
The co-occurrence of psychotic and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms represents an important clinical challenge. Here we consider this problem in the context of a computational psychiatry approach that has been applied to both conditions-predictive coding. Some symptoms of schizophrenia have been explained in terms of a failure of top-down predictions or an enhanced weighting of bottom-up prediction errors. Likewise, autism has been explained in terms of similar perturbations. We suggest that this theoretical overlap may explain overlapping symptomatology. Experimental evidence highlights meaningful distinctions and consistencies between these disorders. We hypothesize individuals with ASD may experience some degree of delusions without the presence of any additional impairment, but that hallucinations are likely indicative of a distinct process.	2.1
This paper analyses the changing conceptualisation of cellular differentiation during the twentieth century. This involved a move away from a view of this process as irreversible to an understanding of it as contingent. We examine the import of this shift for the transformation of stem cell biology, including the therapeutic promise attributed to this field, and how it came to challenge historical conceptions of both the cell and stem cell. We take as our starting point the 2012 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine awarded jointly to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. In the view of the Nobel Committee, their work delineates a paradigm shift in the understanding of cellular differentiation, one that incorporates the concept of 'plasticity'. We explore the emergence, uses and meanings of this concept within this specific biological context, examining and emphasising its role as an epistemological tool. In this setting, 'plasticity' was introduced by cell biologist Helen Blau in the course of research undertaken in the 1980s into the genetics of cell differentiation. We argue that Blau's experimental and theoretical contributions were seminal to a reconceptualisation of this process and provide a crucial link between the work of Gurdon and Yamanaka. Overall, the paper highlights the contested process of conceptual change within the biomedical sciences. It also draws attention to the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between conceptual and technical change, exemplified here in the changing conceptions of cell differentiation following from the analysis of gene expression using new cell fusion and cloning techniques. More broadly, the paper also affords a window onto the shifting priorities, goals and values within late twentieth-century biomedical research.	6.0
With requirement of household heat metering, variable-flow heating network is future trend, but it's difficult to heating according to users' demand because of hydraulic disorder, which is caused mainly by individual user's regulation. Self-operated pressure difference control valve (SPDCV) is widely used in heating system to solve this problem. This paper concentrates on effect of users' flow reduction on other non-regulated users' flow with constant pressure difference of heating network (CPDHN) and constant pressure difference of the end user (CPDE), and change of pressure diagram. Equal pressure drop of parallel user based on Kirchhoff's voltage law is used to theoretical model, and influencing law of users' regulation is obtained. The results are as follow: (1) user's pressure drop is larger than design pressure drop with CPDHN, and is less than design pressure drop with CPDE when any user's flow is reduced; (2) the front non-regulated. users' flow is increased little, and the middle ones take second place, and the back non-regulated users' flow is increased greatly when any user's flow is reduced with CPDHN; (3) the front non-regulated users' flow is reduced greatly, and the middle ones take second place, and the back non-regulated users' flow keep constant when any user's flow is reduced with CPDE. The conclusion can be got that CPDHN is better than CPDE with any user's flow reduction.	1.3
Because of a lack of existing studies of fatigue testing of interlaminar anticracking materials, this study analyzes the principle of generating reflective cracks using three types of composite specimens: a direct overlay asphalt mixture layer, a repaving - impregnated nonwoven geotextile layer, and a repaving anticracking material layer. The study proposes a method for laboratory fatigue testing and observing reflective cracks. The specimens were used in a bending fatigue test with a centric load and a shear fatigue test with an eccentric load. The test results were analyzed by regression analyses that showed that the anticracking material layer had much better crack resistance than the direct overlay asphalt mixture layer and the repaving - impregnated nonwoven geotextiles layer, because the anticracking material layer could absorb most of bending and shear stresses near the cracks to efficiently delay the generation and expansion of reflective cracks. This study can be used as a reference to make a reasonable selection of an interlaminar anticracking material for rigid - flexible composite pavements.

Women, especially in developing countries, are often responsible for managing water at the household level. However, they are rarely represented in bodies that decide on water management, and they hardly play a role in the implementation of projects to increase water access. While the need for enhanced gender equity in water management is acknowledged in the international development discourse, the complexities of implementing it are poorly understood. This article presents a qualitative case study of women participation in the Program 'One Million Cisterns' in the Brazilian Semi-Arid region, to illustrate the promise and the challenges of bringing about women's participation and empowering. The case study shows that women not only derived significant material benefits from the program (access to water), they also acquired roles and responsibilities - as cistern builders and as members of local water commissions - that traditionally had been reserved for men. Key for this transformational process, we argue, was the role played by local feminist NGOs and social movements who helped rural women create new spaces for social inclusion in water development.

The versatility of fuel cells enables a wide range of applications. Usually fuel cells are combined to stacks such that the reactant supply of the single cells is achieved via a pipe branching system, the manifold. The overall performance significantly depends on cell flow rates which are related to the fluidic interaction of the manifold and the cells. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, which are often used to find a suitable design, lack experimental flow data for validation of the numerical results. To enable flow measurements within the small geometries of the manifold and to provide reliable velocity information inside a real fuel cell stack, a low-coherence Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) is applied, which uses multi-mode laser light to achieve a spatial resolution of <100 mu m. The use of fluorescent particles and backward scatter mode make the sensor highly suitable for the application in small manifold geometries like in fuel cell stacks. Sensor and measurement technique are validated in simplified stack models and the applicability to air flows is demonstrated. Finally, for the first time, velocity profiles with high spatial resolution inside an operated fuel cell stack are presented, which serve as benchmark for CFD to find an optimal geometry.

Supermarkets nowadays are equipped with barcode scanners to speed up the checkout process. Nevertheless, most of the agricultural products cannot be pre-packaged and thus must be weighted. The development of produce recognition system based on computer vision could help the cashiers in the supermarkets with the pricing of these weighted products. This work proposes a hybrid approach of object classification and attribute classification for the produce recognition system which involves the cooperation and integration of statistical approaches and semantic models. The integration of attribute learning into the produce recognition system was proposed due to the fact that attribute learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for bridging the semantic gap and assisting in object recognition in many fields of study. This could tackle problems occurred when less training data are available, i.e. less than 10 samples per class. The experiments show that the correct classification rate of the hybrid approach were 60.55, 75.37 and 86.42% with 2, 4 and 8 training examples, respectively, which were higher than other individual classifiers. A well-balanced specificity, sensitivity and F-1 score were achieved by the hybrid approach for each produce type.	0.0
Previous research suggests that the established link of vertical position and self-assignment of social power affects the processing of social exclusion. We hypothesized that verticality-induced self-assignment of social power moderates the evaluation of exclusion via a change in subjective expectancy of social participation. Following this idea, a superior position-associated with higher power-was supposed to increase the sensitivity for a transition to social exclusion. The transition was simulated in a virtual ball tossing game (cyberball): an inclusionary block was followed by partial exclusion of the participant. The participants' vertical position relative to the co-players was varied in three experimental groups (superior vs. even vs. inferior). From inclusion to partial exclusion, we observed an increase of an event-related brain potential related to the violation of subjective expectancy (P3), and participants reported a corresponding increase in threat to social needs and negative mood. For participants at inferior position exclusionary effects on both, P3 and need threat, were less pronounced as compared to participants at even or superior position. These results indicate that verticality impacts basic cognitive processes of subjective expectancy formation. An inferior position already provides a bias for the loss of social power, and the transition to social exclusion is less unexpected.	2.1
The industry's interest in having a greater control of the deformations caused by welding is due to the geometric and dimensional tolerances been more and more precise in the project specifications, motivating the manufacturing engineering to develop stable processes and to ensure routine production. Aiming at it, the main goal of this present work is to analyze how much routine situations used in automatic aluminum welding can influence on the angular deformations of this material. Using the alloy AA 5052 H34, and the automatic welding in pulsed GMAW process, three types of weaving were applied throughout the length of the weld, in butt joints assembled without groove and with 60 degrees single-V-groove, arranged transversely as well as longitudinally to the rolling direction of the plate. The measurement of the deformations was made by a three-dimensional equipment, before and after the welding, in three distinct regions in the specimens. The profile of the weld bead was the main factor for the different types of deformations found, as revealed by macrographical analysis. The 60 degrees single-V-groove had higher amplitudes of deformations as the joint without groove. The torch oscillation wasn't a variable of statistically significant influence on this amplitudes.	3.2
A series of novel ferulic acid-O-alkylamines derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. In vitro studies displayed that all the synthesized target compounds showed impressive inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), significant inhibition/disaggregation of self-induced beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregation and acted as potential antioxidants. Particularly, compound 7f, one of the most potent BuChE inhibitor ( IC50 value of 0.021 mu M for equine serum BuChE, 8.63 mu M for ratBuChE and 0.07 mu M for human serum BuChE), was found to be a good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (IC50 = 2.13 mu M for electric eel AChE, 1.8 mu M for ratAChE and 3.82 mu M for human erythrocytes AChE), and the result of molecular docking provided an explanation for its selective BuChE inhibitory activity. Compound 7f also had noteworthy inhibitory effects on selfinduced A beta(1-42) aggregation (50.8 +/- 0.82%) and was found to disaggregate self- (i)nduced A beta(1-42) aggregation (38.7 +/- 0.65%), which was further elucidated by the transmission electron microscopy. Meanwhile, compound 7f showed the modest antioxidant activity (0.55 eq of Trolox), good protective effect against H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury, with low toxicity. Moreover, compound 7f could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Significantly, compound 7f did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 1000 mg/ kg, and the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine- induced memory deficit in mice. Taken together, the results indicated that compound 7f is a very promising multifunctional agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the advanced stages of AD.

Background: Nursing education programs in every state must meet specified NCLEX pass rate standards in order to maintain licensure and accreditation. These standards are a source of great anxiety for educators and students. There is wide variety of pass rate standards among the states. In addition, individual nursing program pass rates vary substantially from one year to the next. Objectives: Pass rate variation suggests the need for scrutiny of the accuracy of applying state pass rates as a standard for evaluating nursing education program. This study considers the implications of such variation. Design: The study computes 95% confidence intervals for nursing program pass rates from 2010 to 2014 to determine whether programs that failed to meet pass rate standards may have done so by accident and whether programs that met pass rate standards may have done so by accident. Data: The study data includes statutes and regulations that establish pass rate standards and NCLEX pass rates for 1792 nursing programs reflected in reports provided by state nursing boards. Findings: Almost 20% of nursing education programs violated the state pass rate standard at least once between 2010 and 2014. Among the programs that failed to meet pass rate standards, 28.4% had a 95% confidence interval that extended above the pass rate standard, A determination that these programs did not meet pass rate standards could well be erroneous. Approximately 17.4% of programs that met pass rate standards had confidence intervals that went below the pass rate standard. A finding that these programs complied with state pass rate standards might also be erroneous. Conclusions: Application of confidence intervals to nursing program pass rates suggests that use of pass rate standards to evaluate nursing program quality may not be appropriate. This suggests the need to rethink application of state pass rate standards when evaluating nursing education programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.4
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) have always been designed to enhance and improve the network security issue by detecting, identifying, assessing and reporting any unauthorized and illegal network connections and activities. The purpose of this research is to improve on the existing Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection (ABID) method using K-Means clustering technique as to maximize the detection rate and accuracy while minimizing the false alarm. The problem with outliers may disturb the K-Means clustering process as it might be avoided in the clustering process from mixing with the normal data that make the NIDSs become less accurate. Thus this research aims to improve the performance of the ABID systems that balance the loss of information or ignored data in clustering. An integrated machine learning algorithm using K-Means Clustering with discretization technique and Naive Bayes Classifier (KMC-D+NBC) is proposed against ISCX 2012 Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset. The outcome depicts that the proposed method generates better detection rate and accuracy up to 99.3% and 99.5% respectively and reduces the false alarm to 1.2% with better efficiency of 0.03 seconds time taken to build model.	0.2
Linear regression models are a popular choice for the relationships between water quality parameters and bands (or band ratios) of remote sensing data. However, this research regards the phenomena of mixed pixels, specular reflection, and water fluidity as the challenges to establish a robust regression infidel. Based on the data of measurements in situ and remote sensing data, this study presents an enumeration based algorithm, called matching pixel by pixel (MPP), and tests its performance in an empirical model of water quality mapping. Four small reservoirs, which cover a mere several hundred-thousand m(2), in Kinmen, Taiwan, are selected as the study sites. The multispectral sensors, carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), are adopted to acquire remote sensing data regarding water quality parameters, including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi disk depth (SDD), and turbidity in the reservoirs. The experimental results indicate that, while MPP can reduce the influence of specular reflection on regression model establishment, specular reflection does hamper the correction of thematic map production. Due to Water fluidity, sampling in situ should be followed by UAV imaging as soon as possible. Excluding turbidity, the obtained estimation accuracy can satisfy the national standard.

Water and other liquids can cause production problems for natural gas wells. An established but labour-intensive method for removing these liquids is the use of absorbent foam sticks, which are lowered into the wells and then lifted back up again. This paper presents an automated solution for launching foam sticks down gas wells and recovering them - and without the need for a grid electricity supply. The foam-stick launching apparatus has an enclosed magazine with several chambers. It is controlled by a solar-powered skid-mounted electric-pneumatic control system, which includes a storage battery, time relays, a wireless switch module and a compressed gas supply. A typical water-producing gas well was selected to illustrate the technology. Its successful application indicates that engineers can remove liquid from water-producing gas wells and bring them back to production normally using this novel artificial lift technology, which can also be used in remote areas with no electrical supply.	3.4
Over the last few decades, asthma and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children have experienced similar increases in prevalence, and have both been shown to have airway inflammation, leading investigators to postulate an association between asthma and SDB. However, whether this relationship is causal or not needs to be proven. In this manuscript, we use the most widely accepted epidemiologic criteria for causality, the Bradford Hill criteria, to test step-by-step whether the relation between asthma and SBD in children is causal or not. We found studies supporting 8 of the 9 criteria (strength, consistency, specificity, biological gradient, coherence and biological plausibility, experiment, and analogy) for association between asthma and SDB. However, we did not find any study showing temporality or directionality between asthma and SDB. Therefore, establishing a causal association between asthma and SDB is not yet possible.

Using discrete GPUs for processing very large datasets is challenging, in particular when an algorithm exhibit unpre-dictable, data-driven access patterns. In this paper we investigate the utility of GPUfs, a library that provides direct access to files from GPU programs, to implement such algorithms. We analyze the system's bottlenecks, and suggest several modifications to the GPUfs design, including new concurrent hash table for the buffer cache and a highly parallel memory allocator. We also show that by implementing the workload in a warp-centric manner we can improve the performance even further. We evaluate our changes by im-plementing a real image processing application which creates collages from a dataset of 10 Million images. The enhanced GPUfs design improves the application performance by 5.6 x on average over the original GPUfs, and out-performs both 12-core parallel CPU which uses the AVX instruction set, and a standard CUDA-based GPU implementation by up to 2.5 x and 3 x respectively, while significantly enhancing system programmability and simplifying the application design and implementation.	0.4
One serious problem that all the developed nations are facing today is death and injuries due to road accidents. The collision of an animal with the vehicle on the highway is one such big issue, which leads to such road accidents. In this paper, a simple and a low-cost approach for automatic animal detection on highways for preventing animal-vehicle collision using computer vision techniques are proposed. A method for finding the distance of the animal in real-world units from the camera mounted vehicle is also proposed. The proposed system is trained on more than 2200 images consisting of positive and negatives images and tested on various video clips of animals on highways with varying vehicle speed. As per the two-second rule, our proposed method can alert the driver when the vehicle speed is up to 35 km/h. Beyond this speed, though the animal gets detected correctly, the driver does not get enough time to prevent a collision. An overall accuracy of almost 82.5% is achieved regarding detection using our proposed method.	0.0
Today, many forms of art are influenced by the emergence of interactive technologies, including the mixing of physical media with digital technology for forming new hybrid works of art and the usage of mobile phones to create art projected on public spaces. Many artists and painters use digital technology to augment their work technically and creatively. In the same context many believe that the time of transition from traditional analogue art to post-modern digital art, that is, to an art grounded in codes rather than images has arrived (http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit8-5-05.asp.). The research work described in this paper contributes towards supporting, through the use of Ambient Intelligence technologies, traditional painters' creativity, as well as methods and techniques of art masters. The paper presents the design and implementation of an intelligent environment and its software infrastructure, to form a digitally augmented Art Workshop. Its practical exploitation was conducted in an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) simulation space and four feasibility studies were conducted. In each of these studies an oil painting was created following an alternative, yet accredited by artists, approach.	4.0
Narratives are an important component of culture and play a central role in transmitting social values. Little is known, however, about how the brain of a listener/reader processes narratives. A receiver's response to narration is influenced by the narrator's framing and appeal to values. Narratives that appeal to protected values, including core personal, national, or religious values, may be particularly effective at influencing receivers. Protected values resist compromise and are tied with identity, affective value, moral decision-making, and other aspects of social cognition. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying reactions to protected values in narratives. During fMRI scanning, we presented 78 American, Chinese, and Iranian participants with real-life stories distilled from a corpus of over 20 million weblogs. Reading these stories engaged the posterior medial, medial prefrontal, and temporo-parietal cortices. When participants believed that the protagonist was appealing to a protected value, signal in these regions was increased compared with when no protected value was perceived, possibly reflecting the intensive and iterative search required to process this material. The effect strength also varied across groups, potentially reflecting cultural differences in the degree of concern for protected values.	2.1
Frequent inundation has become a serious problem in urban areas. It is necessary to improve rainwater retention/infiltration in the urban watershed. The purpose of this study is to report how private rainwater-retention/harvesting facilities can be spread gradually but steadily in the city by citizen initiated activities. Rainwater harvesting tanks were installed intensively and a rainwater harvesting house was constructed in the city of Fukuoka, Japan after the city experienced a flood disaster. The former enhanced users' daily preparedness for emergency, and the latter inspired construction of a rainwater harvesting housing complex. A public elementary school is in use from April 2016, which is inspired by these facilities. The school premises are located on the land reclaimed from an old irrigation pond. Thus the school needs to be adapted to this condition. 3000 m(3) of rainwater can be retained within the premises. The amounts of retention and discharge are monitored, and the data is utilized for science education. In big cities, people tend to depend too much on the top-down, mega-system, which invites more impervious surfaces in urban areas.

Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)) determination by multicapillary zone electrophoresis (MZE) can additionally be used to detect Hb A(2), Hb F and most common hemoglobin (Hb) variants. We assessed the effectiveness of this method for detecting -thalassemia (-thal), -thalassemia (-thal) and most common Hb variants. Moreover, Hb F/Hb A(2) is evaluated as an index for discriminating between - and -thal traits. The theoretical -thalassemia major (-TM) birth rate in our healthcare area is calculated and contrasted with real data. A MZE technique was used for Hb A(1c) measurements in 27,724 patients. Previous criteria for carrier detection were established and subsequently confirmed by molecular biology techniques. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 100.0%. The prevalence of -thal trait (including -thal) was 0.34%. The most prevalent mutations (estimated per 100,000 population) were HBB: c.118C>T (57.7%), HBB: c.93-21G>A (50.5%), HBB: c.92+1G>A (43.3%), HBB: c.92+6T>C (32.5%) and HBB: c.20delA (18.0%) for -thalassemias, and Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T) (32.5%) and Hb J-Baltimore (HBB:c.3880T>A) (28.9%) for Hb variants. We found a paradoxical result between the theoretical -TM birth rate and real data. We calculated an optimal Hb F/Hb A(2) index cutoff of 0.71 for discriminating between - and -thal traits. This method is highly cost-effective for detecting -thalassemias and common Hb variants. Prevalence results match previous data for the Spanish population. Heterogeneity of mutations in Spain has markedly increased as a consequence of migration. The Hb F/Hb A(2) index cutoff could be used to predict -thal trait.	6.0
We describe the main features of the developed software tool, namely PlatE-Motion 2.0 (PEM2), which allows inferring the Euler pole parameters by inverting the observed velocities at a set of sites located on a rigid block (inverse problem). PEM2 allows also calculating the expected velocity value for any point located on the Earth providing an Euler pole (direct problem). PEM2 is the updated version of a previous software tool initially developed for easy-to-use file exchange with the GAMIT/GLOBK software package. The software tool is developed in Matlab(A (R)) framework and, as the previous version, includes a set of MATLAB functions (m-files), GUIs (fig-files), map data files (mat-files) and user's manual as well as some example input files. New changes in PEM2 include (1) some bugs fixed, (2) improvements in the code, (3) improvements in statistical analysis, (4) new input/output file formats. In addition, PEM2 can be now run under the majority of operating systems. The tool is open source and freely available for the scientific community.	0.4

Objective To determine in a cohort of young patients with suspected axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the prevalence of lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV), its association with local bone marrow edema (BME) and lumbar spine degeneration, and the potential relationship with MRI findings and clinical signs of axSpA. Materials and methods Baseline imaging studies and clinical information of patients from the SPondyloArthritis Caught Early-cohort (back pain >= 3 months, <= 2 years, onset < 45 years) were used. Two independent readers assessed all patients for LSTV on radiography, and BME-like and degenerative changes on MRI. Patients with and without LSTV were compared with regard to the prevalence of MRI findings and the results of clinical assessment using Chi-squared test or t test. Results Of 273 patients (35.1% male, mean age 30.0), 68 (25%) patients showed an LSTV, without statistical significant difference between patients with and without axSpA (p = 0.327). Local sacral BME was present in 9 out of 68 (13%) patients with LSTV and absent in patients without LSTV (p < 0.001). Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score and spinal mobility assessments were comparable. Conclusions LSTV is of low clinical relevance in the early diagnosis of axSpA. There is no difference between patients with and without LSTV regarding the prevalence of axSpA, pain and spinal mobility, and a BME-like pattern at the pseudoarticulation does not reach the SI joints.	5.3
People living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) are increasingly recognized as experts in HIV and their own health. We developed a simulated clinical encounter (SCE) in which medical students provided HIV pre-and post-test counselling and point-of-care HIV testing for PHAs as patient instructors (PHA-PIs) under clinical preceptor supervision. The study assessed the acceptability of this teaching tool with a focus on assessing impact on HIV-related stigma among medical students. University of Toronto pre-clerkship medical students participated in a series of SCEs facilitated by 16 PHA-PIs and 22 clinical preceptors. Pre-and post-SCE students completed the validated Health Care Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale (HPASS). HPASS measures overall stigma, as well as three domains within HIV stigma: stereotyping, discrimination, and prejudice. Higher scores represented higher levels of stigma. An additional questionnaire measured comfort in providing HIV-related care. Mean scores and results of paired t-tests are presented. Post-SCE, students (n = 62) demonstrated decreased overall stigma (68.74 vs. 61.81, p < .001) as well as decreased stigma within each domain. Post-SCE, students (n = 67) reported increased comfort in providing HIVrelated care (10.24 vs. 18.06, p < .001). Involving PHA-PIs reduced HIV-related stigma among medical students and increased comfort in providing HIV-related care.	2.0
Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) is becoming an epidemic problem in our society, especially among older adults, being known as the Silent Epidemic. People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the explbitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare Aml systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited. Finally, how this system is used to both design and execute therapies for people with ABI is presented.	4.0
Flower-like PbS/Ni2P composites were synthesized by a facile two-step chemical route. The morphology and structure of the resulting composites were investigated by SEM and TEM images and XRD spectra, respectively. The results showed that the as-obtained composites were composed of the cubic PbS flowers and hexagonal Ni2P nanoparticles, and Ni2P nanoparticles coated on the surfaces of flower-like PbS microstructure. It was found that changing the molar ratio to 3:1, flower-like PbS/Ni2P composites have been successfully synthesized by using cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide(CTAB) and anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as template. Furthermore, using methylene blue(MB) as a model organic pollutant, the photocatalytic degradation experiments indicated that the as-prepared composites showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation activity for methylene blue(75%) which is as higher as that of the only flower-like PbS (16.6%) and only Ni2P nanoparticles (44.8%) at the same time. This work may be expected to find its potential application in water pollution treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.4

In particular, our approach extends BAG with observation node that can be used to imply and adjustment compromising probability timely and dynamically.	0.2
The changes in the character of industrial production, happened in the last decades, required to make significant adjustments to training engineers (training of the engineers) in almost all specialties and directions of higher education. In the last century, the development of production was largely depended on the improvement of technological modes, machine design and introduction of new process control techniques. That's why it was necessary to pay much attention to the study of well-known (given) technologies as detailed knowledge of a particular technology was essential for the success of engineer. In recent years the situation has comletely changed. The main direction of industrial production now is the development and introduction of modern technologies. It states new demands to the engineers, the most important of which is the ability to learn and develop new technologies and processes. It forced us to reconsider the content of engineers training. Under these circumstances, D. Mendeleev University's (MUCTR) mission is to meet the growing needs of the economy and civil society in Russia and to train competitive specialists able to work in the chemical industry and high-tech sectors of the country's production, research and educational sectors. Considering the extensive experience (over 100 years) of the leading chemical-technological university in the country, the University seeks to apply the accumulated potential for the development of innovative approaches to the training of competent engineering, scientific and managerial personnel for a wide range of sectors of activity, aimed at modernizing the country's economy. The main competitive advantages of MUCTR are: the existence of famous scientific and educational schools in the University, which successfully operate even in low-resource support; the widespread introduction of new educational standards, training and retraining programs; existence of successfully working system of integration between university, academic science and industry; the current system of selection of the most talented students, the active involvement of young teachers and researchers in higher education; the real mechanism of rapid response to the needs of the economy in the training engineers and highly qualified scientific personnel; guaranteed employer demand for specialists (bachelors, masters) in chemical, petrochemical, and other innovative industries; awareness of the management, scientific and educational community of D.

People-forest interactions in protected area have been debated around the world. The present study evaluates land-use pattern, diversity and utilization of forest resources in Marat Longri Wildlife Sanctuary (WLS) using semi-structured interview, remote sensing, and Global Information System(GIS) techniques. Such study can have many implications on people-forest interactions in the sanctuary and promote symbiotic approach in dealing with biodiversity conservation in protected area. Marat Longri WLS is indispensable to forest dwellers for subsistence and livelihoods. The result of pair-wise ranking revealed jhum (3160) is the major threat to forest cover followed by illegal felling (2850), agricultural expansion (2346), encroachment (2211) and collection pressure (2080). To reduce dependence on Marat Longri WLS, domestication of wild plants and other agroforestry systems can augment food production and realize other needs of forest dwellers.	4.2
Many cities around the world have reached a critical situation when it comes to energy and water supply, threatening the urban sustainable development. From an engineering and architecture perspective it is mandatory to design cities taking into account energy and water issues to achieve high living and sustainability standards. The aim of this paper is to develop an optimization model for the planning of residential urban districts with special consideration of renewables and water harvesting integration. The optimization model is multi-objective which uses a genetic algorithm to minimize the system life cycle costs, and maximize renewables and water harvesting reliability through dynamic simulations. The developed model can be used for spatial optimization design of new urban districts. It can also be employed for analyzing the performances of existing urban districts under an energy-water-economic viewpoint. The optimization results show that the reliability of the hybrid renewables based power system can vary between 40 and 95% depending on the scenarios considered regarding the built environment area and on the cases concerning the overall electric load. The levelized cost of electricity vary between 0.096 and 0.212 $/kW h. The maximum water harvesting system reliability vary between 30% and 100% depending on the built environment area distribution. For reliabilities below 20% the levelized cost of water is kept below 1 $/m(3) making competitive with the network water tariff. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
We investigate the inside dynamics of solutions to integrodifference equations to understand the genetic consequences of a population with nonoverlapping generations undergoing range expansion. To obtain the inside dynamics, we decompose the solution into neutral genetic components. The inside dynamics are given by the spatiotemporal evolution of the neutral genetic components. We consider thin-tailed dispersal kernels and a variety of per capita growth rate functions to classify the traveling wave solutions as either pushed or pulled fronts. We find that pulled fronts are synonymous with the founder effect in population genetics. Adding overcompensation to the dynamics of these fronts has no impact on genetic diversity in the expanding population. However, growth functions with a strong Allee effect cause the traveling wave solution to be a pushed front preserving the genetic variation in the population. In this case, the contribution of each neutral fraction can be computed by a simple formula dependent on the initial distribution of the neutral fractions, the traveling wave solution, and the asymptotic spreading speed.	6.4
The modification of an energy-based approach called the dissipating energy flow (DEF) method is proposed, which uses data from phasor measurement units (PMUs) to trace the source of poorly damped natural and forced oscillations in power systems. The original energy-based approach (Chen et al., 2013) assumes the ability to determine steady-state values of variables measured by PMU during the transient process and that prevents the reliable use of the original method with actual PMU data. PMU data processing, proposed in the DEF method, is a key step in converting the energy-based method into a robust and automated tool for use with actual PMU data. The effectiveness of the proposed DEF method is demonstrated by testing multiple simulated cases of sustained oscillations, including both poorly damped natural and forced oscillations and more than 30 actual events in ISO New England (ISO-NE) and two events in Western Electricity Coordination Council (WECC) systems. The study also demonstrates the potential for using the DEF method to estimate the contribution of any generator to the damping of a specific oscillation mode. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Permethrin is a pyrethroid insecticide widely used in agriculture and public health. It has been suggested that permethrin may interact with other chemicals used during military deployments and, as a result, be a potential cause of Gulf War Related Illness. To determine the causal relationship between permethrin and human health effects, the basic enzymatic pathway of permethrin metabolism in humans should be understood. In the present study we report that trans-permethrin is metabolized in human liver fractions, producing phenoxybenzyl alcohol (PBOH) and phenoxybenzoic acid (PBCOOH). We identified human alcohol (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) as the enzymes involved in the oxidation of phenoxybenzyl alcohol, the permethrin hydrolysis product, to phenoxybenzoic acid by way of phenoxybenzaldehyde (PBCHO). Cis-permethrin was not significantly metabolized in human liver fractions. Cytochrome P450 isoforms were not involved either in the hydrolysis of trans-permethrin or in the oxidation of PBOH to PBCOOH. Purified ADH isozymes oxidized PBOH to PBCHO and PBOH was a preferred substrate to ethyl alcohol. Purified ALDH was responsible for PBCHO oxidation to PBCOOH with similar substrate affinity to a previously known substrate, bcnzyl alcohol. Based on these observations, it appears that PBOH is oxidized to PBCHO by ADH and subsequently to PBCOOH by ALDH, although PBCHO does not accumulate during microsomal incubation. In order to analyze permethrin and its metabolites, previous HPLC-UV methods had to be re-validated and modified. The resulting refined HPLC-UV method is described in detail.

This article presents an experiment with seniors and people with visual impairment in a voice-controlled smart home using the SWEET-HOME system. The experiment shows some weaknesses in automatic speech recognition that must be addressed, as well as the need for better adaptation to the user and the environment. Users were disturbed by the rigid structure of the grammar and were eager to adapt it to their own preferences. Surprisingly, while no humanoid aspect was introduced in the system, the senior participants were inclined to embody the system. Despite these aspects to improve, the system has been favorably assessed as diminishing most participant fears related to the loss of autonomy.	4.0
Gabor wavelet can extract most informative and efficient texture features for different computer vision and multimedia applications. Features extracted by Gabor wavelet have similar information as visualized by the receptive field of simple cells in the visual cortex of the mammalian brains. This motivates researchers to use Gabor wavelet for feature extraction. Gabor wavelet features are used for many multimedia applications such as stereo matching, face and facial expression recognition (FER), texture representation for segmentation. This motivates us to analyze Gabor features to evaluate their effectiveness in representing an image. In this paper, three major characteristics of Gabor features are established viz., (i) Real coefficients of Gabor wavelet alone is sufficient enough to represent an image; (ii) Local Gabor wavelet features with overlapping regions represent an image more accurately as compared to the global Gabor features and the local features extracted for the non-overlapping regions; and (iii) Real coefficients of overlapping regions are more robust to radiometric changes as compared to the features extracted from both global and local (non-overlapping regions) by using real, imaginary and magnitude information of a Gabor wavelet. The efficacy and effectiveness of these findings are evaluated by reconstructing the original image using the extracted features, and subsequently the reconstructed image is compared with the original image. Experimental results show that the local Gabor wavelet features extracted from overlapping regions represent an image more efficiently than the global and non-overlapping region-based features. Experimental results also show that the real coefficients alone is sufficient enough to represent an image more accurately as compared to the imaginary and magnitude informations.	0.0
Panic patients experience recurrent panic attacks. Two main neurochemical hypotheses have been proposed to explain this vulnerability. The first suggests that panic patients have deficient serotonergic inhibition of neurons localized in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain that organizes defensive reactions to cope with proximal threats as well as of sympathomotor control areas of the rostral ventrolateral medulla that generate neurovegetative symptoms of the panic attack. The second proposes that endogenous opioids buffer panic attacks in normal subjects, and their deficit results in heightened sensitivity to suffocation and separation anxiety in panic patients. Experimental results obtained in rat models of panic indicate that serotonin interacts synergistically with endogenous opioids in the dorsal periaqueductal gray through 5-HT1A and mu-opioid receptors to inhibit proximal defense and, supposedly, panic attacks. These findings allow reconciliation of the serotonergic and opioidergic hypotheses of panic pathophysiology. They also indicate that endogenous opioids are likely to participate in the panicolytic action of antidepressants and suggest that exogenous opioids may be useful for treating panic patients resistant to conventional pharmacotherapy.

An ultra-precision 3D coordinate measuring machine (CMM), the TriNano N100, has been developed. In our design, the workpiece is mounted on a 3D stage, which is driven by three parallel drives that are mutually orthogonal. The linear drives support the 3D stage using vacuum preloaded (VPL) air bearings, whereby each drive determines the position of the 3D stage along one translation direction only. An exactly constrained design results in highly repeatable machine behavior. Furthermore, the machine complies with the Abbe principle over its full measurement range and the application of parallel drives allows for excellent dynamic behavior. The design allows a 3D measurement uncertainty of 100 nanometers in a measurement range of 200 cubic centimeters. Verification measurements using a Gannen XP 3D tactile probing system on a spherical artifact show a standard deviation in single point repeatability of around 2 nm in each direction.	3.3
Under the design conditions of a research reactor, the siphon phenomenon induced by pipe rupture can cause continuous efflux of water. In order to prevent water efflux, an additional facility is necessary. A siphon breaker is a type of safety facility that can resist the loss of coolant effectively. However, analysis of siphon breaking is complex since it comprises two-phase flow and there are many inputs to be considered. For this reason, in order to facilitate the analysis and design of the siphon breaker, a simulation program based on fluid mechanics was developed using MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) programming. From Bernoulli's equation, the velocity and quantity as well as undershooting height, water level, pressure, friction coefficient, and factors related to the two-phase flow could be calculated. The Chisholm model, which was included in the program to analyze the two-phase flow, can predict the results in a manner similar to those obtained from a real-scale experiment. By modifying the values of the input parameters and analyzing the results with respect to loss of coolant accident (LOCA) locations, the size of pipe and coefficients could be compared easily. Since simulation results are shown in the form of a graph, the user is able to confirm the total breaking situation. Furthermore, it is possible to save the entire simulation results. The simulation results were shown to be similar to those obtained from the real-scale experiment and the program functioned correctly. By using the program, the user is easily able to confirm the status of the siphon breaking, and the program is also helpful in the design of the siphon breaker. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

BACKGROUND CONTEXT: There is limited research investigating educational attainment as a risk factor for low back pain (LBP), with the influence of gender commonly being neglected. Furthermore, genetics and early shared environment explain a substantial proportion of LBP cases and need to be controlled for when investigating risk factors for LBP. PURPOSE: To investigate whether educational attainment affects the prevalence and risk of LBP differently in men and women while controlling for the influence of genetics and early shared environment. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional and prospective twin case-control study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins from the Murcia Twin Registry, with available data on educational attainment, formed the base sample for this study. The prevalence analysis considered twins with available data on LBP in 2013 (n=1,580). The longitudinal analysis considered twins free of LBP at baseline (2009-2011), with available data on LBP at follow-up (2013) (n=1,077). OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on the lifetime prevalence of activity limiting LBP (outcome) and educational attainment (risk factor) were self-reported. METHODS: The prevalence analysis investigated the cross-sectional association between educational attainment and LBP, whereas the longitudinal analysis investigated whether educational attainment increased the risk of developing LBP. Both analyses were performed in the following sequence. First, a total sample analysis was performed on all twins (considering them as individuals), adjusting for confounding variables selected by the data. Second, to control for the influence of genetics and early shared environment, a within-pair case-control analysis (stratified by zygosity) was performed on complete twin pairs discordant for LBP (ie, one twin had LBP, whereas the co-twin did not). All analyses were stratified for gender where possible, with an interaction term determining whether gender was a significant moderator of the association between educational attainment and LBP. RESULTS: Women with either general secondary or university education were less likely to experience (prevalence analysis) or to develop LBP (longitudinal analysis). Educational attainment did not affect the risk of LBP in men. When controlling for the effects of genetics and early shared environment, the relationship between educational status and LBP in women was no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Educational attainment affects LBP differently in men and women, with higher levels of education only decreasing the risk of developing LBP in women. After adjusting for genetics and early shared environment, the relationship between educational attainment and LBP in women disappears. This suggests that genetics and early shared environment are confounding the relationship between educational attainment and LBP in women. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	6.4
The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) is used to describe a group of inflammatory autoimmune diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis, with common genetic risk factors and clinical features. SpA is clinically distinct from rheumatoid arthritis and typically affects the spine, sacroiliac joints, entheses, and, less commonly, peripheral joints. Although the pathogenesis of SpA is not fully understood, recent findings have identified the interleukin (IL)-17 pathway as a key mediator of disease pathogenesis. Clinical evidence for the efficacy of IL-17A inhibition by biologic agents was initially shown in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, another autoimmune disease mediated by the IL-17 pathway. Subsequently, similar positive efficacy for inhibition of IL-17A was seen in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Inhibition of IL-17A may also improve cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities often found in patients with SpA because studies have linked these disorders to the IL-17 pathway. In this review, we will examine key preclinical studies that demonstrated the mechanistic role of IL-17A in the development SpA and discuss how these observations were translated into clinical practice.	5.3
The review of application of projective geometry for interpretation of growth of the human body is submitted and features of use of this geometry in the electric circuit theory are shown. Growth of the human body, the change of regime parameters of a network is interpreted as projective transformations. These transformations possess invariants, there are cross ratios of four points. The common mathematical apparatus represents interdisciplinary approach in view of analogy of processes of a different physical nature. The obtained results develop methodology of application of non-Euclidean geometries.	1.2
This paper explores the large-signal and small-signal dynamics of a series-capacitor (SC) buck-type converter and introduces an optimal closed-loop control scheme to accommodate both the steady-state and transient modes. As opposed to a conventional buck converter, where time-optimal control is realized by a single on-off cycle, in the SC-buck topology there is a need to distribute the switching phases to satisfy the charge-balance of the flying capacitor. The new control method hybrids a voltage-mode small-signal controller for steady-state operation and a non-linear, state-plane based transient-mode control scheme for load transients. A detailed principle of operation of the SC-buck converter is provided and explained through an average behavioral model and state-plane analysis. The operation of the controller is experimentally verified on a 12W 12V-to-1.5V converter, demonstrating voltage-mode control operation as well as time-optimal response for load transients.	1.4
Destination memory refers to the ability to remember to whom a piece of information was previously transmitted. Our paper assessed this ability in schizophrenia. Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia and 25 control participants told proverbs (e.g., send a thief to catch a thief) to pictures of celebrities (e.g., Elvis Presley). Afterward, participants had to indicate to which celebrity they had previously said the proverbs. Participants also completed a binding task in which they were required to associate letters with their corresponding context (i.e., location). Analysis revealed worse destination memory and binding in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. In both populations, destination memory was significantly correlated with performances on the binding task. Our findings suggest difficulty in the ability to attribute information to its appropriate destination in schizophrenia. This difficulty may be related to compromise in binding separate cues together to form a coherent representation of an event in memory.	2.1
This study demonstrates a new method for rapid and precise maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic (PV) applications using dithered PWM control. Constraints imposed by efficiency, cost, and component size limit the available PWM resolution of a power converter, and may in turn limit the MPP tracking efficiency of the PV system. In these scenarios, PWM dithering can be used to improve average PWM resolution. In this study, we present a control technique that uses ripple correlation control (RCC) on the dithering ripple, thereby achieving simultaneous fast tracking speed and high tracking accuracy. Moreover, the proposed method solves some of the practical challenges that have to date limited the effectiveness of RCC in solar PV applications. We present a theoretical derivation of the principles behind dithering digital ripple correlation control, as well as experimental results that show excellent tracking speed and accuracy with basic hardware requirements.	1.4
The in vitro metabolisms of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B), 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-7) were studied using TESTLIVER (TM)-rat and TESTLIVER (TM)-human, which are new three-dimensional rat and human hepatocyte culture systems, respectively. The metabolites produced in the incubation media were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data obtained with the in vitro system of rat origin were carefully compared with those obtained by rat in vivo experiments; most of the metabolites found in the in vivo experiments could be reproduced in the present three-dimensional in vitro experiments, although quantitative metabolite distribution patterns obtained with the three-dimensional system was somewhat different from those of in vivo experiments. Because human in vivo experiments are not possible, especially for dubious designer drugs, the in vitro experiments using the three-dimensional human hepatocyte culture system seem very useful for studying human metabolism of new designer drugs as an alternative to human experiments.	6.2
Objective: No clinical data are available for the new computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) material zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) ceramic. This study describes preliminary clinical results for indirect ZLS CAD/CAM restorations after 12 months. Method and Materials: Indirect restorations were fabricated, using the CEREC method and intraoral scanning (CEREC Omnicam, CEREC MCXL). Sixty-seven restorations were seated adhesively (baseline). Sixty restorations were evaluated after 12 months (follow-up), using modified FDI criteria. Two groups were established, according to ZLS restorations' post-processing procedure prior to adhesive seating: group I (three-step polishing, n = 32) and group II (fire glazing, n = 28). Statistical ana-lysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test (P.05). Statistically significant differences were found for criteria surface gloss for group I and group II (Mann-Whitney U test, P <.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates ZLS CAD/CAM restorations have a high clinical success rate after 12 months. A longer clinical evaluation period is necessary to draw further conclusions.	3.0
There remains conflict in the literature about the lateralisation of affective face perception. Some studies have reported a right hemisphere advantage irrespective of valence, whereas others have found a left hemisphere advantage for positive, and a right hemisphere advantage for negative, emotion. Differences in injury aetiology and chronicity, proportion of male participants, participant age, and the number of emotions used within a perception task may contribute to these contradictory findings. The present study therefore controlled and/or directly examined the influence of these possible moderators. Right brain-damaged (RBD; n = 17), left brain-damaged (LSD; n = 17), and healthy control (HC; n = 34) participants completed two face perception tasks (identification and discrimination). No group differences in facial expression perception according to valence were found. Across emotions, the RBD group was less accurate than the HC group, however RBD and LBD group performance did not differ. The lack of difference between RBD and LBD groups indicates that both hemispheres are involved in positive and negative expression perception. The inclusion of older adults and the well-defined chronicity range of the brain-damaged participants may have moderated these findings. Participant sex and general face perception ability did not influence performance. Furthermore, while the RBD group was less accurate than the LED group when the identification task tested two emotions, performance of the two groups was indistinguishable when the number of emotions increased (four or six). This suggests that task demand moderates a study's ability to find hemispheric differences in the perception of facial emotion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.3
Characterised by the increased spread of technology out of workplaces and into public spaces and homes, the so-called third-wave of human-computer interaction has placed greater focus on scenarios that are socially situated, context dependent and not necessarily task oriented. This movement has led to studies investigating how people interact with digital applications in public spaces, but the discussion of intuitive interaction thus far has not been extended to this new realm of user interfaces. Designing for intuitive interaction in public spaces differs from traditional digital applications due to the inherently fluid social nature and often large-scale character of urban interventions. This article discusses the design of interaction for public spaces, based on applications we developed along the years, contrasted to similar endeavours elsewhere. We analyse them through the lens of frameworks for intuitive interactions and derive a series of strategies towards designing for immediate use and high crowd turnaround in urban interventions.	4.0
The present study investigates people's perceived likelihood of experiencing negative emotion in response to a potentially jealousy-inducing Facebook wall post that was ostensibly sent by a rival. Facebook messages were varied so that participants (n = 821) viewed a message containing text only or text plus either an attractive or unattractive photo of the sender, a winking face emoticon, words in all capitals, or triple exclamation points. Participants were then asked to indicate the degree of negative emotion they would feel if they saw this message on their romantic partner's Facebook wall. The addition of wink-face emoticons and physical attractiveness cues in a Facebook wall post contributed to differences in likely experienced emotion. Participants also reported a greater likelihood of experiencing negative emotion if they were high in preoccupied attachment and low in dismissive attachment. Finally, women reported being more likely to experience negative interpersonal affect in response to the Facebook post than did men. Implications for the role nonverbal cues play in computer-mediated contexts, such as Facebook, are discussed.	2.3
Internal users are the main causes of anomalous and suspicious behaviors in a communication network. Even when traditional security middleboxes are present, internal attacks may lead the network to outages or to leakage of sensitive information. In this article, we propose BroFlow, an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System based on Bro traffic analyzer and on the global network view of the software-defined networks (SDN) which is provided by the OpenFlow. BroFlow main contributions are (i) dynamic and elastic resource provision of traffic-analyzing machines under demand; (ii) real-time detection of DoS attacks through simple algorithms implemented in a policy language for network events; (iii) immediate reaction to DoS attacks, dropping malicious flows close of their sources, and (iv) near-optimal placement of sensors through a proposed heuristic for strategically positioning sensors in the network infrastructure, which is shared by multi-tenants, with a minimum number of sensors. We developed a prototype of the proposed system, and we evaluated it in a virtual environment of the Future Internet Testbed with Security (FITS). An evaluation of the system under attack shows that BroFlow guarantees the forwarding of legitimate packets at the maximal link rate, reducing up to 90 % of the maximal network delay caused by the attack. BroFlow reaches 50 % of bandwidth gain when compared with conventional firewalls approaches, even when the attackers are legitimate tenants acting in collusion. In addition, the system reduces the sensors number, while keeping full coverage of network flows.	0.2
Monoclonal antibodies are universal binding molecules and are widely used in biomedicine and research. Nevertheless, the generation of these binding molecules is time-consuming and laborious due to the complicated handling and lack of alternatives. The aim of this protocol is to provide one standard method for the generation of monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. This technology combines two steps. Step 1 is an appropriate immunization of the animal and step 2 is the fusion of B lymphocytes with immortal myeloma cells in order to generate hybrids possessing both parental functions, such as the production of antibody molecules and immortality. The generated hybridoma cells were then recloned and diluted to obtain stable monoclonal cell cultures secreting the desired monoclonal antibody in the culture supernatant. The supernatants were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for antigen specificity. After the selection of appropriate cell clones, the cells were transferred to mass cultivation in order to produce the desired antibody molecule in large amounts. The purification of the antibodies is routinely performed by affinity chromatography. After purification, the antibody molecule can be characterized and validated for the final test application. The whole process takes 8 to 12 months of development, and there is a high risk that the antibody will not work in the desired test system.	6.3
This paper proposes a numerical method for accurate time-domain noise simulation of mixed analogue/digital electrical circuits that in principle do not admit a periodic steady-state working condition, such as fractional sigma phase-locked loops (PLLs). By means of a tool known as saltation matrix, which allows dealing with non-smooth vector fields, a variational approach is adopted. The power spectral density of a noisy electrical variable is computed by applying the Thomson's multitaper method (MTM) to the numerical solution of the stochastic variational model of the circuit. This allows to resort to a single transient simulation run, thus avoiding cpu time consuming Monte-Carlo-like approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by comparing simulation results related to a commercial fractional sigma PLL with experimental data.	1.2
The paper considers a feedback cellular neural network (CNN) obtained by interconnecting elementary cells with an ideal capacitor and an ideal flux-controlled memristor. It is supposed that during the analogue computation of the CNN the memristors behave as dynamic elements, so that each dynamic memristor (DM)-CNN cell is described by a second-order differential system in the state variables given by the capacitor voltage and the memristor flux. The proposed networks are called DM-CNNs, that is CNNs using a dynamic (D) memristor (M). After giving a foundation to the DM-CNN model, the paper establishes a fundamental result on complete stability, that is convergence of solutions toward equilibrium points, when the DM-CNN has symmetric interconnections. Because of the presence of dynamic memristors, a DM-CNN displays peculiar and basically different dynamic properties with respect to standard CNNs. First of all a DM-CNN computes during the time evolution of the memristor fluxes, instead of the capacitor voltages as for a standard CNN. Furthermore, when a steady state is reached, the memristors keep in memory the result of the computation, that is the limiting values of the fluxes, while all memristor currents and voltages, as well as all currents, voltages, and power in the DM-CNN vanish. Instead, for standard CNNs, currents, voltages, and power do not drop off when a steady state is reached. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	1.2
The paper presents an application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to fixations' sequences analysis. The examination concerns eye tracking data gathered during performing simple comparison and decision tasks for four versions of plain control panels. The panels displayed the target and current velocity either on a digital or analog (clock-face) speedometers. Subjects were to decide whether increase or decrease the current speed by pressing the appropriate button. The obtained results suggest that females, generally exhibit different covert attention patterns than men. Moreover, the article demonstrates the estimated four HMM with three hidden states for every examined control panels variant and provides discussion of the outcomes.	1.4
The use of nonwoven geotextile drains in geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures has been suggested to facilitate the dissipation of pore water pressure. It has also been recognised that the nonwoven geotextile may retard water penetration due to the capillary barrier effect under unsaturated soil conditions and can function as a drainage material only once the soil immediately above it is nearly saturated. In this study, numerical models of unsaturated slopes with nonwoven geotextile drains, subjected to rainfall infiltration were developed to investigate the unsaturated hydraulic behaviour and stability of slopes constructed with nonwoven geotextile drains in thin layers of highly permeable sand (i.e. sand cushions). The numerical models were first validated for their suitability for modelling water flow and the capillary barrier effect within unsaturated soils using the experimental results from a one-dimensional soil column infiltration test and full-scale infiltration tests. Next, a series of numerical simulations of unsaturated slopes with and without sand cushions and under different infiltration conditions were performed. The numerical results indicated that the sand cushions reduced the development of the capillary barrier effect by acting as an intermediate material between the backfill and the nonwoven geotextile, which bridged the gap between two materials with very different unsaturated hydraulic characteristics. The reduction of the development of the capillary barrier effect led to the accumulation of pore water pressure above the nonwoven geotextile being effectively dissipated downward. The sand cushions also acted as additional drain layers to facilitate the drainage of water within the slope system. Thus, the inclusion of sand cushions enhanced the local slope stability for soils above the top geotextile layer. Based on the numerical results, methods for determining the occurrence of the capillary barrier effect are identified from the literature and discussed.	4.1
Introduction: Spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) is a rare disease that causes cord compression and neurologic deficit. Spontaneous SEH is related to minor trauma, bleeding disorders, and anticoagulant medications. Posttraumatic SEH has been associated with low-energy spine hyperextension injuries in patients with ankylosing spinal disorders such as ankylosing spondylitis and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). A variant named atypical DISH-like with SEH is reported. Objective: To describe the management, diagnosis, and treatment of an unusual SEH case in a patient causing delayed neurologic deficit with rigid atypical DISH-like spine. Case Description: An elderly woman with prior antiplatelet therapy presented with delayed neurological deficit suffering trauma after falling. Computed tomography (CT) imaging studies reveal hyperextension fracture pattern and signs mimic DISH missed on standard X-ray images. Magnetic resonance (MR) study demonstrates posterior epidural mass compatible with SEH in thoracic spine with cord compression. Using a midline posterior approach, an urgent intervention and a left multiple partial unilateral decompressive laminectomy at T4-T7 and a long instrumented fusion at T3-T9 were performed for achieving spinal stability and neurological improvement, both of which were observed. Conclusion: Patients with rigid spine who sustain low-energy injuries may be prone to have a fracture and epidural hematoma, especially if they take anticoagulant medications. Imaging studies including MR and CT scans should be reviewed carefully to rule out any occult fracture. Urgent or early surgical hematoma drainage and instrumented fusion must be performed to achieve stability and functional recovery.	5.3
All interpersonal interactions are underpinned by action: perceiving and understanding the actions of others, and responding by planning and performing self-made actions. Perception of action, both self-made and observed, informs ongoing motor responses by iterative feedback within a perception-action loop. This fundamental phenomenon occurs within single-cells of the macaque brain which demonstrate sensory and motor response properties. These 'mirror' neurons have led to a swathe of research leading to the broadly accepted idea of a human mirror system. The current review examines the putative human mirror system literature to highlight several inconsistencies in comparison to the seminal macaque data, and ongoing controversies within human focused research (including mirror neuron origin and function). In particular, we will address the often-neglected other side to the 'mirror': complementary and opposing actions. We propose that engagement of the mirror system in meeting changing task-demands is dynamically modulated via frontal control networks. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This article investigates how varieties of knowledge about flooding contribute to a more effective flood management (FM) governance configuration in Chennai, India. Drawing on the assemblage perspective and using the configurations approach for socio-spatial analyses of the city, we trace the knowledge construction processes around two networked FM infrastructures, drawing out the different discourses, actor coalitions and processes of practice. We see how technical knowledge on storm water drains is embedded and transformed within the primary government network, and how complementary knowledges about the ery system are expressed through counter mappings by academic activists. Identifying potential intersections between these knowledge processes indicates a strong potential to link long-term water management strategies that would mutually contribute to addressing the city's issues of flood risks and drinking water scarcity. However, we find that the varieties of knowledge around Chennai's FM run in parallel networks with few intersections, presenting distinct institutional boundaries to cross-boundary knowledge sharing. Lastly, using integrated FM as a heuristic framework, we analyse the contributions of the different streams of knowledge and the remaining gaps in order to assess the potential of building up the interconnections in Chennai's FM configuration.

People who are high in victim-sensitivity a personality trait characterized by a strong fear of being exploited by others are more likely to attend to social cues associated with untrustworthiness rather than to cues associated with trustworthiness compared with people who are low in victim-sensitivity. But how do these people react when an initial expectation regarding a target's trustworthiness turns out to be false? Results from two studies show that victim-sensitive compared with victim-insensitive individuals show enhanced source memory and greater change in person perception for negatively labeled targets that violated rather than confirmed negative expectations (the trustworthy trickster). These findings are in line with recent theorizing on schema inconsistency and expectancy violation effects in social cognition and with research on the different facets of justice sensitivity in personality psychology.	2.1
In this paper, we study the k-labeled spanning forest (kLSF) problem in which an undirected graph whose edges are labeled and an integer-positive value k are given; the aim is to find a spanning forest of the input graph with the minimum number of connected components and the upper bound k on the number of labels. The problem is related to the minimum labeling spanning tree problem and has several applications in the real world. In this paper, we compare several metaheuristics to solve this NP-hard problem. In particular, the proposed intelligent variable neighborhood search (VNS) shows excellent performance, obtaining high-quality solutions in short computational running time. This approach integrates VNS with other complementary approaches from machine learning, statistics, and experimental algorithmics, in order to produce high-quality performance and completely automate the resulting optimization strategy.	0.1
This study examined gender, age, and task differences in positive touch and physical proximity during mother-child and father-child conversations. Sixty-five Spanish mothers and fathers and their 4- (M = 53.50 months, SD = 3.54) and 6-year-old (M = 77.07 months, SD = 3.94) children participated in this study. Positive touch was examined during a play-related storytelling task and a reminiscence task (conversation about past emotions). Fathers touched their children positively more frequently during the play-related storytelling task than did mothers. Both mothers and fathers were in closer proximity to their 6-year-olds than their 4-year-olds. Mothers and fathers touched their children positively more frequently when reminiscing than when playing. Finally, 6-year-olds remained closer to their parents than did 4-year-olds. Implications of these findings for future research on children's socioemotional development are discussed.	2.3
Under homeostatic conditions, as well as in various diseases, leukocyte migration is a crucial issue for the immune system that is mainly organized through the activation of bone marrow-derived cells in various tissues. Immune cell trafficking is orchestrated by a family of small proteins called chemokines. Leukocytes express cell-surface receptors that bind to chemokines and trigger transendothelial migration. Most allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis, are generally classified by the tissue rather than the type of inflammation, making the chemokine/chemokine receptor system a key point of the immune response. Moreover, because small antagonists can easily block such receptors, various molecules have been developed to suppress the recruitment of immune cells during allergic reactions, representing potential new drugs for allergies. We review the chemokines and chemokine receptors that are important in asthma, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis and their respectively developed antagonists.	5.1
In water treatment, flocculation creates aggregated particles or flocs large enough to be removed by downstream processes of sedimentation and filtration. Fluidized beds of flocs (floc blankets) are sometimes included in upflow sedimentation processes because they can significantly improve sedimentation tank particle removal when plate or tube settlers are used. Overall performance of a sedimentation tank containing a floc blanket is influenced by the characteristics of incoming flocs fromthe flocculator. Floc blankets provide an additional opportunity for aggregation of colloidal particles that enables a reduction in the size of the flocculators, while improving particle removal efficiency. In this study, laminar flow flocculators varying in velocity gradient (G) and residence time (theta) were tested in a laboratory scale water treatment systemwith a floc blanket. Results indicate that increasing G (range of 74-251 s(-1)), while decreasing residence time from 269 to 80 s, and maintaining a constant G theta (similar to 20,000) improved particle removal. These results indicate that velocity gradients greater than existing design recommendations may be used to reduce flocculator residence times (and associated construction costs) when upflow sedimentation with a floc blanket and overlying lamellar plate or tube settlers are employed subsequent to flocculation. Further reduction of the residence time to 24 s with a G of 251 s(-1) resulted in a settled water turbidity of 14 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). When varying theta at a constant G of 72 s(-1), an apparentminimum in settled effluent turbidity at 0.15 NTU was observed at the middle residence time tested (theta = 211 s), suggesting that long hydraulic flocculator residence times may be suboptimal.	3.4
This paper proposes a novel DC-side discrete-time voltage controller for grid-connected voltage-sourced converters during asymmetrical faults. The main objective is to eliminate the second-order voltage oscillation on the VSC's DC-side, as well as the positive sequence third-order harmonic current injection into the grid during asymmetrical faults. The compensator is designed based on the comprehensive discrete-time model of the DC-side dynamics. It is shown that DC-side average voltage can be controlled by the positive sequence direct axis current, while the oscillating component can be fully controlled by negative sequence dq-axes currents. The negative sequence current references are obtained using a discrete resonant controller plus a lead filter in order to achieve zero steady state error and asymptotically stability, without injecting harmonics currents into the grid. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under severe fault conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.4
Depression storage (DS) is the maximum storage of precipitation and runoff in the soil surface at a given slope. The DS is determined by soil roughness that in agricultural soils is largely affected by tillage. The direct measurement of DS is not straightforward because of the natural permeability of the soil. Therefore, DS has generally been estimated from 2D/3D empirical relationships and numerical algorithms based on roughness indexes and height measurements of the soil surface, respectively. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of some 2D models for DS, using direct and reliable measurements of DS in an agricultural soil as reference values. The study was carried out in experimental microplots where DS was measured in six situations resulting from the combination of three types of tillage carried out parallel and perpendicular to the main slope. Those data were used as reference to evaluate four empirical models and a numerical method. Longitudinal altitudinal profiles of the relief were obtained by a laser profilometer. Infiltration measurements were carried out before and after tillage. The DS was largely affected by tillage and its direction. Highest values of DS are found on rougher surfaces mainly when macroforms cut off the dominant slope. The empirical models had a limited performance while the numerical method was the most effective, even so, with an important variability. In addition, a correct hydrological management should take into account that each type of soil tillage affects infiltration rate differently. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	3.1
Port scan detection is one of the important topics in network security and has received lots of attention by researchers; however a slow port scan attack can deceive most of the existing IDS. Besides, it is unreasonable in typical detection to decide whether it is a probe based on the precise threshold especially when the feature values are around the threshold without taking the uncertainty into consideration. To address these problems, a novel approach was proposed by collecting traffic statistics information called access port set (APS) for each IP address in time windows; several traffic features are extracted from APS which are considered as multiple evidences to indicate a probe. For each evidence, three probabilities are concerned to evaluate the likelihood of the probe occurring which include the probabilities of support, nonsupport and uncertainty. The comprehensive evidence can be obtained from the combination of multiple evidences to evaluate the probe threaten. Several experiments were performed to evaluate the approach with DARPA/MIT datasets and our own generated attack datasets; the experimental results show the feasibility of our approach in terms of detection accuracy and effectiveness. The mechanism can be applied not only in port scan detection but also other precise threshold based situations such as traffic abnormal analysis and intrusion detection.

Recently, there has been an increase in the use of finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for power converters. Model predictive control (MPC) uses the discrete-time model of the system to predict future values of control variables for all possible control actions and computes a cost function related to control objectives. This control technique can provide fast dynamic response. However, MPC method implementation imposes a very high computational burden and causes significant hardware requirements for real-time implementation. In this paper, a fully field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based real-time implementation of MPC is proposed for direct matrix converter (DMC). In the proposed method, all control calculations and the safe commutation scheme for DMC are fully implemented in the FPGA and the need for another digital control platform, such as digital signal processors (DSP) or dSPACE, is eliminated. The proposed scheme takes full advantages of the parallel computation capability of FPGAs.	1.4
Lipids are a diverse class of metabolites that play several key roles in the maintenance of human health. Lipidomics, which focuses on the global study of molecular lipids in cells, tissues, and biofluids, has been advancing rapidly over the past decade. Recent developments in MS and computational methods enable the lipid analysis with high throughput, resolution, sensitivity, and ability for structural identification of several hundreds of lipids. In nutrition research, lipidomics can be effectively used to elucidate the interactions between diet, nutrients, and human metabolism. Lipidomics can also be applied to optimize the effects of food processing on the dietary value, and in the evaluation of food-related health effects.	6.2
Previous research has shown that young children deny being able to see an agent whose eyes are covered. The current study explored this phenomenon further. In Experiment 1, 3-year-olds denied that they could see, but affirmed that they could look at, a doll whose eyes were covered-indicating that they demand mutuality for seeing another but not for looking at another. In Experiment 2, 3.5-year-olds drew the same distinction between see and look at when facing a doll or a human. A strong correlation between children's knowledge of the reciprocal pronoun each other and their adherence to the mutuality demand was found. The results are discussed with respect to children's bias for second personal encounters and children's relational concept of persons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.2
Feature weighting is a vital step in machine learning tasks that is used to approximate the optimal degree of influence of individual features. Because the salience of a feature can be changed by different queries, the majority of existing methods are not sensitive enough to describe the effectiveness of features. We suggest dynamic weights, which are dynamically sensitive to the effectiveness of features. In order to achieve this, we propose a differentiable feature weighting function that dynamically assigns proper weights for each feature, based on the distinct feature values of the query and the instance. The proposed weighting function, which is an extension of our previous work, is suitable for both single modal and multi-modal weighting problems, and, hence, is referred to as a General Weighting Function. The number of parameters of the proposed weighting function is fewer compared to the ordinary weighting methods. To show the performance of the General Weighting Function, we proposed a classification algorithm based on the notion of dynamic weights, which is optimized for one nearest neighbor algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the ordinary feature weighting methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	0.1
A high level of concern is placed on the storage, handling, transportation, and distribution of vaccines and other pharmaceutical products, particularly those that are time and temperature sensitive. While active and passive cooling equipment and monitoring devices are important, it is the various personnel responsible for executing and writing procedures, designing and operating systems, and investigating problems and helping prevent them who are paramount in establishing and maintaining a cold.chain for time and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products (TTSPPs). These professionals must possess the required competencies, knowledge, skills and abilities so they can effectively perform these activities with appropriate levels of expertise. These are complex tasks that require the development of higher cognitive skills that cannot be adequately addressed through professional development opportunities based on simple information delivery and content acquisition. This paper describes two unique learning solutions (one on a bus called the wheels course and the other online called e-learning) that have been developed by WHO Global Learning Opportunities (WHO/GLO) to provide participants with opportunities not just to learn about cold chain systems or vaccine management, but, rather, to develop high levels of expertise in their respective fields through experiential and authentic learning activities. In these interactive learning environments, participants have opportunities to address real-life situations in contexts similar to what they may face in their own work environments and develop solutions and critical thinking skills they can apply when they return to their jobs. This paper further delineates the managerial and operational vaccine management functions encompassed in these two unique learning environments. The paper also describes the alignment of the objectives addressed in the wheels course and the e-learning version with effective vaccine management (EVM) criteria as prescribed by WHO. The paper concludes with an example of a real world product developed by course graduates (specifically a decision tree that is now used by some national programmes). These types of products, valuable in their own right, often emerge when learning environments based on authentic learning principles are designed and implemented as they were by WHO/GLO.

Jet electrochemical machining is a promising shaping method that has the potential to replace traditional sinking ECM in the industry owing to its flexibility and stability. However, its machining quality is impaired by the occurrence of a unique phenomenon (i.e., the anode cannot be uniformly dissolved with high nozzle travel rate). This paper aims to analyze this unique phenomenon from the viewpoint of anodic behavior and to select the optimum travel rate parameter window. The anodic behavior of TB6 titanium alloy in sodium chloride solution was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry. A time-dependent mechanism of pitting/large localized corrosion/polishing for the anodic interface structure was developed. The full electricity quantity of the equivalent oxide layer capacitor, Q, was proposed as a criterion for the initiation of uniform dissolution state. Subsequently, a novel model that incorporates the parameter Q was developed to account for the effect of anodic behavior. This model is able to predict the machined profile as well as the localized corrosion range. Finally, the effect of nozzle travel rate on jet ECM performance was investigated, and a nozzle travel rate of 10 to 25 mu m s(-1) was selected as the optimum parameter window in the present work.

Multitasking is present in all activities of daily living and needs precise assessment to allow ecological patient-specific intervention. The use of multitasking in diagnostic tools remains rare, due to the difficulties of implementing this in laboratory settings. To overcome these difficulties, Serious Games represent a good surrogate method as it offers the possibility to recreate a functional setting in a safe daily living environment and allows testing and quantifying multitasking performances in an enjoyable and motivating way. The purpose of the study was to investigate the potential of a new Serious Game based multitasking assessment tool by examining the cognitive validity and the real life representability of the tool. Eighteen healthy elderly controls participated in the study. They were asked to execute a cooking activity in the Serious Game and in real life, and were assessed using a neuropsychological test battery. Results showed that performance on the virtual cooking task was associated with multiple cognitive measures and that performances in the virtual task were highly representative of what participants did in real life. This tool is a first step toward including ecologically valid measures for a comprehensive assessment of healthy elderly controls and may help to assesses elderly patients with diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

Background: There is growing acceptance that the increase in thyroid cancer incidence is in part a result of overdiagnosis of small low-risk papillary microcarcinomas (PMCs) with indolent clinical course. Although surgery is the cornerstone treatment for patients with PMCs, recent management guidelines are shifting toward inclusion of more conservative treatments such as active surveillance. There is little evidence on clinicians' experience in managing PMC patients and their attitudes toward treatment options, including their willingness to accept a nonsurgical option. The aim of this study was to understand how clinicians perceive a diagnosis of PMC, potential changes to terminology, and the treatment options available to patients. Methods: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews conducted between November 2015 and May 2016 with 22 clinicians (seven endocrinologists and 15 thyroid surgeons). Transcribed audio-recordings were thematically coded, and a framework method was used to analyze the data. Results: Across a sample of clinicians who manage thyroid cancer patients, awareness of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of PMC was common. However, there was little acceptance of active surveillance to manage these patients. Clinicians did not feel comfortable recommending this management approach, as they were worried about the risk of metastases, did not feel that evidence to support this approach was strong enough, and also believed that patients currently have a high preference for surgery. The majority of clinicians did not believe that changing the terminology of this diagnosis was a viable strategy to reduce patients' anxiety and their perceived preference for more aggressive treatments. However, most clinicians felt that thyroid nodules <1 cm should not be biopsied, which could help minimize the risk of overdiagnosis of PMC. Conclusions: This study, based on a non-representative sample of 22 clinicians, which remains an important limitation, provides revealing insight into clinicians' management preferences and decision making for small low-risk thyroid cancers at a time when management guidelines and practices are evolving. It suggests that clinicians may not be ready to accept nonsurgical options, or changes in terminology, until evidence to support these options and changes is stronger.	5.4
This study conducted at one university in Guangzhou, mainly examined the English majors' pragmatic failure in both verbal and nonverbal communication and explores the possible causes from students' perspectives. Combination of quantitative method and qualitative method were employed in the research including testing, questionnaire, interviews and observation. The results indicate that the average pragmatic competence of the subjects is still in a poor level. They committed pragmatic failure not only in verbal communication but also in nonverbal one. The study explored the causes of the failures from learners' perspective and offered implications for further research.	2.3
Road designers assume that drivers will follow the road alignment with trajectories centred in the lane, and move at the design speed parallel to the road centreline (i.e., the horizontal alignment). Therefore, they assume that if the horizontal alignment indicates the designed trajectory, the driving path indicates the operating trajectory. However, at present, they do not have the necessary tools to measure the relationship between the designed alignment and possible vehicle trajectories. The paper has two objectives: (a) to develop an understanding of the root causes of differences between road alignment and vehicle trajectories; and (b) to define and calibrate a model that estimates the local curvature of trajectories on the basis of the designed horizontal alignment. The two objectives were pursued by carrying out a naturalistic survey using vehicles equipped with high precision GPS in real-time kinematics (RTK) mode driven by test drivers on road sections of known geometric characteristics. The results provide an insight into the effects of road geometrics on driver behaviour, thus anticipating possible driving errors or unexpected/undesired behaviours, information which can then be used to correct possible inconsistencies when making decisions at the design stage.

Catchbasins (also known as gully pot in the UK and Australia) are used to receive surface runoff and drain the stormwater into storm sewers. The recent interest in catchbasins is to improve their effectiveness in removing sediments in stormwater. An experimental study was conducted to examine the hydraulic features and sediment capture efficiency in catchbasins, with and without a bottom sump. A sump basin is found to increase the sediment capture efficiency significantly. The effect of inlet control devices, which are commonly used to control the amount of flow into the downstream storm sewer system, is also studied. These devices will increase the water depth in the catchbasin and increase the sediment capture efficiency. Equations are developed for predicting the sediment capture efficiency in catchbasins.	3.1
The use of high resolution ground-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) datasets provides spatial density and vertical precision for obtaining highly accurate Digital Surface Models (DSMs). As a result, the reliability of flood damage analysis has improved significantly, owing to the increased accuracy of hydrodynamic models. In addition, considerable error reduction has been achieved in the estimation of first floor elevation, which is a critical parameter for determining structural and content damages in buildings. However, as with any discrete measurement technique, LiDAR data contain object space ambiguities, especially in urban areas where the presence of buildings and the floodplain gives rise to a highly complex landscape that is largely corrected by using ancillary information based on the addition of breaklines to a triangulated irregular network (TIN). The present study provides a methodological approach for assessing uncertainty regarding first floor elevation. This is based on: (i) generation an urban TIN from LiDAR data with a density of 0.5 points.m(-2), complemented with the river bathymetry obtained from a field survey with a density of 0.3 points.m(-2). The TIN was subsequently improved by adding breaklines and was finally transformed to a raster with a spatial resolution of 2 m; (ii) implementation of a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model based on the 500-year flood return period. The high resolution DSM obtained in the previous step, facilitated addressing the modelling, since it represented suitable urban features influencing hydraulics (e.g., streets and buildings); and (iii) determination of first floor elevation uncertainty within the 500-year flood zone by performing Monte Carlo simulations based on geostatistics and 1997 control elevation points in order to assess error. Deviations in first floor elevation (average: 0.56 m and standard deviation: 0.33 m) show that this parameter has to be neatly characterized in order to obtain reliable assessments of flood damage assessments and implement realistic risk management.	3.1
The purpose of this paper is to propose a flexible load-dependent digital soft-start control method for dc-dc converters in a 380 Vdc system. The soft-start operation is needed to prevent negative effects such as large inrush current and output overshoot to a power supply in the start-up process of dc-dc converters. In the conventional soft-start operation, a dc-dc converter has a very slow start-up to deal with the light load condition. Therefore, it always takes a long time in any load condition to start up a power supply and obtain the desired output. In the proposed soft-start control method, the speed of the start-up process is flexibly controlled depending on the load condition. To obtain the optimal speed for any load condition, the speed of the soft-start is determined from a approximated function of load current, which is estimated from experiment results in advance. The proposed soft-start control method is evaluated both in simulations and experiments. From results, it is confirmed that the proposed method has superior soft-start characteristics compared to the conventional one.	1.4
The high resolution, accurate mass, and fast scanning features of the Orbitrap(TM) mass spectrometer, combined with the separation power of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography were applied for the first time to study the metabolic profiles of several organic flame retardants (FRs) present in indoor dust. To mimic real-life exposure, in vitro cultured HepG2 human hepatocyte cell lines were exposed simultaneously to various FRs in an indoor dust extract for 24 h. Target parent FRs, hexabromocyclododecanes (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-HBCDs), tris-2-chloroethyl phosphate (TCEP), tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP), and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), were separated in a single run for the first time using alternating positive and negative heated ESI source. Further metabolite separation and identification was achieved using full scan (70,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM)), accurate mass (up to 1 ppm) spectrometry. Structural confirmation was performed via all ion fragmentation (AIF) spectra using the optional higher collisional dissociation (HCD) cell and MS/MS analysis. First insights into human metabolism of HBCDs revealed several hydroxylated and debrominated phase I metabolites, in addition to conjugated phase II glucuronides. Furthermore, various hydroxylated, oxidized, and conjugated metabolites of chlorinated phosphorous FRs were identified, leading to the suggestion of alpha-oxidation as a significant metabolic pathway for these compounds.	6.2
Rainwater collected from a rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH) system is typically not considered suitable for potable uses, primarily because of poor microbial quality. The quality of stored rainwater, however, can be improved through basic design and maintenance practices during the construction and operation of an RWH system. This paper presents the microbial analysis of rainwater in two RWH systems installed at the Seoul National University Campus in South Korea. Rainwater samples were collected at different locations within each system and analyzed for total and fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and heterotrophic plate count bacteria. Within their storage tanks, water quality improved horizontally from inlet to outlet points, and higher quality was observed at the supply point (located about 0.5 m from the base of the tank) than at the surface or bottom of the tank. First-flush rainwater was found to be highly contaminated but rainwater quality improved following about 1 mm of precipitation. The catchment surface also had a significant effect on the quality of rainwater; samples collected from a rooftop exhibited better microbial quality than from a terrace catchment. Better water quality in underground tanks (dark storage conditions) compared to open weirs/filters (exposed to natural light) demonstrated the importance of storage conditions. Water quality also improved with longer storage, and a decrease of 70% to 90% in microbial concentrations was observed after about 1 week of storage time. The findings of this study demonstrate that the microbial quality of harvested rainwater can be improved significantly by the adoption of proper design and maintenance guidelines such as those discussed in this paper.	4.3
Optogenetics is a rapidly developing new technique that combines optical methods with techniques that are used in molecular biology. It can be used for monitoring various optical processes in cells and controlling their activity using light. The technique is based on bacterial opsin expression in mammalian neurons. In this review, the use of optogenetics for controlling the activity of specific neuronal populations in different regions of the human brain is considered in detail. The paper also presents information on light-sensitive proteins, genetically encoded optical instruments, and their use for activation or inhibition of neurons and investigation of the causal relationship between neural networks and pathological symptoms.	6.0
Purpose of Review The ANCA-associated vasculitides are a group of small vessel vasculitides characterized by autoantibodies recognizing the neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens PR3 and MPO. We examine the current clinical and molecular immunology understanding of ANCA-associated vasculitides and discuss the current needs in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these rare diseases. Recent Findings The majority of efforts to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases have focused on dissecting neutrophil biology because the neutrophil is the primary expressor of ANCA autoantigens. However, a number of important genetic, clinical, and cellular biology observations suggest that attempts to understand the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitides should move away from emphasis on the role of the neutrophil and instead re-focus on the potential role of other immune cell mediators. Summary Whether or not neutrophils are the key determinant of ANCA-associated vasculitis pathogenesis should be revisited in detail. A neutrophil-centric view of the pathogenesis of these diseases cannot fully account for important genetic, clinical, and cellular biology observations that implicate important and under-appreciated roles for monocytes and T cells. Refocusing on these findings will likely lead to new discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the identification of clinically useful biomarkers for disease activity.	6.3
This study investigates the potential threats or conflicts shadowing social harmony in Johor Malaysia. The State of Johor is inhabited by plural, yet, segregated ethnic groups, thus making them prone to communal conflicts. The process of data collection was conducted between 2010 and 2012 through interviews with 1,000 respondents from 10 regions as well as extensive field observations. The study shows that notwithstanding the conflict potential is confined to low-intensity and sporadic quarrel, the impact of tension which has frequently occurred within families and relatives can lead to clashes in a larger community. In turn, this incites various kinds of prejudice among the fragmented communities. Worse still, the individual perception about tolerance in respect to religious aspects is quite concerning, albeit not demonstrable in the context of inter-ethnic relations. Nonetheless, two most sensitive issues perpetrating social incompatibilities are detected as to the construction of worship places and defamation against different religious identities.	2.0
Real-time imaging of regulated exocytosis in secreting organs can provide unprecedented temporal and spatial detail. Here, we highlight recent advances in 3D time-lapse imaging in Drosophila salivary glands at single-granule resolution. Using fluorescently labeled proteins expressed in the fly, it is now possible to image the dynamics of vesicle biogenesis and the cytoskeletal factors involved in secretion. 3D imaging over time allows one to visualize and define the temporal sequence of events, including clearance of cortical actin, fusion pore formation, mixing of the vesicular and plasma membranes and recruitment of components of the cytoskeleton. We will also discuss the genetic tools available in the fly that allow one to interrogate the essential factors involved in secretory vesicle formation, cargo secretion and the ultimate integration of the vesicular and plasma membranes. We argue that the combination of high-resolution real-time imaging and powerful genetics provides a platform to investigate the role of any factor in regulated secretion.	6.4
Antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) is recognized as a subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). It is associated with autoantibodies directed against aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase enzymes. We report the first case of anti-PL-7/anti-SSA 52kD ASS presenting as acute digital ischemia, an association not described previously. Occlusive vasculopathy is a rare but serious manifestation that can be seen at presentation in patients with ASS and may herald the onset of severe interstitial lung disease (ILD). Comprehensive evaluation should be performed to confirm the presence of subclinical myositis. Extensive myositis-specific antibody testing is strongly recommended even if initial screening autoimmune serologies are unrevealing.	6.3
Monte Carlo method can provide high fidelity neutronics analysis of different types of nuclear reactors, owing to its advantages of the flexible geometry modeling and the use of continuous-energy nuclear cross sections. However, nuclear reactors are complex systems with multi-physics interacting and coupling. MC codes can couple with depletion solver and thermal-hydraulics (T/H) codes simultaneously for the transport-burnup-thermal-hydraulics coupling calculations. MIT BEAVRS is a typical trans port-burnup-thermal-hydraulics coupling benchmark. In this paper, RMC was coupled with sub channel code COBRA, equipped with on-the-fly temperature-dependent cross section treatment and large-scale detailed burnup calculation based on domain decomposition. Then RMC was applied to the full core burnup calculations of BEAVRS benchmark in hot full power (HFP) condition. The numerical tests show that domain decomposition method can achieve the consistent results compared with original version of RMC while enlarging the computational burnup regions. The results of HFP by RMC agree well with the reference values of BEAVRS benchmark and also agree well with those of MC21. This work proves the feasibility and accuracy of RMC in multi-physics coupling and lifecycle simulations of nuclear reactors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.1
The aim of this research is to design a rainwater filtration system by using an activated carbon. The activated carbon had been act as one of the filter medium to filtrate the water. Three filters were design, namely Filter A, Filter B and Filter C, to determine the most effective filter that can be used in the study. To determine the effectiveness of the filter, seven parameters were measured that is temperature, colour, turbidity, total suspended solid (TSS), pH, conductivity and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5). The results shows that the removal of BOD 5 is up to 82%, TSS removal is 55.6% and turbidity removal is 28.8%.	4.3
The textile and dyeing industries are major sources of environmental water pollution all over the world. The textile wastewater effluents discharged into rivers often appear dark red-purple in color due to azo dyes, which can be transformed into carcinogenic aromatic amines. The chemicals used in dyeing are not readily degraded in nature and thus precipitate in river sediment. However, little is known about how dyeing chemicals affect river sediment and river water or how long they persist because they are difficult to monitor. To assess undetectable dyes and byproducts in river sediments, we evaluated the potential of river sediment bacteria to degrade dyes and aromatic amines. We describe the natural remediation of river sediment long-contaminated by textile dyeing effluent. After cessation of wastewater discharge, the dye-degradation potential decreased, and the aromatic amine-degradation potential increased initially and then declined over time. The changes in degradation potential were consistent with changes in the sediment bacterial community. The transition occurred on the order of years. Our data strongly suggest that dyes remained in the river sediment and that aromatic amines were produced even in transparent and no longer colored-river water, but these chemicals were degraded by the changing sediment bacteria. Time-course monitoring of the degradation activities of key bacteria thus enables assessment of the fate of dye pollutants in river sediments. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.	4.4
Theories of race relations have been shaped by the concept of a racial hierarchy along which Whites are the most advantaged and African Americans the most disadvantaged. However, the recent precipitated growth of Latinos and Asian Americans in the United States underscores the need for a framework that integrates more groups. The current work proposes that racial and ethnic minority groups are disadvantaged along 2 distinct dimensions of perceived inferiority and perceived cultural foreignness, such that the 4 largest groups in the United States are located in 4 discrete quadrants: Whites are perceived and treated as superior and American; African Americans as inferior and relatively American compared with Latinos and Asian Americans; Latinos as inferior and foreign; and Asian Americans as foreign and relatively superior compared to African Americans and Latinos. Support for this Racial Position Model is first obtained from targets' perspectives. Different groups experience distinct patterns of racial prejudice that are predicted by their 2-dimensional group positions (Studies 1 and 2). From perceivers' perspectives, these group positions are reflected in the content of racial stereotypes (Study 3), and are well-known and consensually recognized (Study 4). Implications of this new model for studying contemporary race relations (e.g., prejudice, threat, and interminority dynamics) are discussed.	2.0
In sensor-node applications, the auxiliary power is drawn from the ac mains to supply the mixed-signal sensor components. There is therefore a need for low-cost, sub-1W, miniature non-isolated ac-dc down-converters. In this work, a new two-chip architecture is proposed to implement a high-voltage quasi-resonant buck converter with peak current-mode control. The current and voltage control loops are implemented in the high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) IC, respectively. Each IC includes a 700V power transistor, sensing and control circuits. The LS IC transmits the digital peak current command, along with mode selection information, to the HS IC using a low-power 20 MHz isolated communication interface. The architecture achieves a peak simulated efficiency of 85.6% when converting from 339 V to 12 V and allows the size of the input filter to be greatly reduced due to the current-mode operation. State-of-the- art UHV BCD technologies offer a unique opportunity to increase the level of integration and reduce the system cost in the targeted sensor node applications, despite the relatively poor figure-of-merit of the HV devices compared to discrete Silicon super-junction or GaN alternatives.	1.4
Oral immunotherapy may offer an alternative to elimination diets in peanut allergy. Of 72 children for whom this treatment was proposed following an oral challenge test (TPO1), 68 agreed and entered a personalised oral immunotherapy study. There were 10 treatment failures and 31 patients underwent a second oral challenge during treatment (TPO2). Cumulative reactogenic dose and clinical severity score were compared. Skin tests and assay of IgE specific for peanut allergy were first performed prior to TPO1 and again during follow-up. The mean age of these 31 patients was 8.1 years. The median time between two challenge tests was 1.4 years. The mean cumulative reactogenic dose between TPO1 (4207 mg of peanut) and TPO2 (8769 mg of peanut) increased significantly (P < 0.001). Conversely, the clinical severity score was significantly reduced between the two challenge tests (P < 0.001). No serious adverse effects were reported during immunotherapy. This treatment in a paediatric population, administered at the patients' homes, confirms the efficacy of the therapy as well as an acceptable benefit/risk ratio consistent with the data. Oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy is part of a personalised therapeutic approach for children with food allergies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	5.1
Ambient intelligence is an emerging platform that provides advances in sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial intelligence to capture the real time climate data. This result continuously generates several exabytes of unstructured sensor data and so it is often called big climate data. Nowadays, researchers are trying to use big climate data to monitor and predict the climate change and possible diseases. Traditional data processing techniques and tools are not capable of handling such huge amount of climate data. Hence, there is a need to develop advanced big data architecture for processing the real time climate data. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data based surveillance system that analyzes spatial climate big data and performs continuous monitoring of correlation between climate change and Dengue. Proposed disease surveillance system has been implemented with the help of Apache Hadoop MapReduce and its supporting tools.	4.0
Geographic differences in manifestation of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) could be related to differences in genetic or environmental factors. We aimed to compare the disease activity and functional status using validated outcome measures among patients with PsA of different ethnicities living in the same environment. We performed a cross-sectional study on consecutive patients with PsA classified by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria from a single center. Sociodemographic data, clinical variables, and patient-reported outcomes were collected using a standardized protocol. Disease activities were assessed by validated composite scores: clinical Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (cDAPSA), Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (CPDAI), and minimal disease activity (MDA). Physical function was assessed with Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 (SF36) physical function subscales. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with disease activities and physical function. Ninety-eight patients (51.5%, men) with mean (+/- SD) age and duration of PsA of 51.5 +/- 13.8 and 5.5 +/- 8.4 years were recruited. Indian was overrepresented compared with the national distribution of ethnicities. Compared to Chinese, Indian patients were more likely to be using biological therapies, have higher tender joint count, and worse enthesitis. Higher proportion of Indians had higher disease activity categories measured by cDAPSA, CPDAI, and MDA and had poorer physical function. In the multivariable analysis, ethnicity was significantly associated with HAQ and SF36-PF. Compared to Chinese, Indians with PsA living in the same environment had worse disease activity and physical function measured by validated outcomes.	5.3
Politicians on the Right are generally more physically attractive than politicians on the Left One suggested explanation is that politically Right-leaning people are generally more attractive, another that the selection of electoral candidates is, on the Right, more dependent on candidate attractiveness. To assess these two explanations, the attractiveness of Right- and Left-leaning scholars, identified by authorship to prominent ideologically toned intellectual magazines, was compared. In contrast to politicians, scholars would generally not be expected to benefit much from physical attractiveness, nor would the effects of attraction on selection into a scholarly career be expected to differ depending on political ideology. Perceived political orientation of the scholars was an accurate predictor of magazine political orientation, but physical attractiveness was not. Controlling for grooming- better groomed scholars were more likely to appear in Right-leaning journals- more physically attractive scholars were more likely appear in Left-leaning journals. The results suggest that the reason that politicians on the Right are physically more attractive than politicians on the Left is that the selection of electoral candidates is, on the political Right, more dependent on candidate attractiveness, not that ideologically Right-leaning people generally look better.

A roaded catchment (RC) is a representative type of artificial catchment for rainwater harvesting. The rainfall-runoff threshold value of the RC is the main factor which influences the system efficiency and cost. Antecedent soil moisture condition is an important factor which impacts on the determination of the rainfall-runoff threshold value. In this study, rainfall-antecedent soil moisture condition-runoff relationships and the potential efficiency of RCs are presented. Rainfall and runoff data monitored at research sites in Merredin and Mount Barker are used to determine this relationship. Two antecedent moisture criteria; Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) and Average Antecedent Precipitation (AAP) are used to analyse the relationship between previous rainfall and soil moisture for each RC. Monitored results show that AMC is not that suitable to show the relationship between rainfall and antecedent soil moisture condition of the RC in the dryland of Western Australia and it is recommended to use AAP to determine this relationship.	4.3
Children's perceptions of social resource inequalities were investigated by measuring open-ended explanations for race-based disparities in access to societal resources. Fifth graders (N = 139, M = 11.14 years, SD = 0.61 years) viewed animated vignettes depicting hypothetical resource inequalities between institutions serving children of African-American and European-American background. Children frequently explained disparities in terms of institutions' differing financial resources, revealing awareness that economic inequalities often underlie groups' differential access to societal resources. Further, children attributed inequalities to differential treatment more often when they witnessed' African-Americans at a disadvantage than when they witnessed European Americans at a disadvantage, demonstrating awareness that racial minority groups are more likely to experience restricted access to resources. Finally, children who reasoned about differential treatment judged inequality, and actions that perpetuated inequality, more negatively than children who attributed inequalities to institutions' differing needs, revealing a link between awareness of discrimination and rejection of social inequalities.

There are debates about whether rainwater is suitable as drinking water. A serious shortcoming of the debate is that there are differences in the design and management of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. This study is based on the performance of two RWH systems that are used for drinking purposes at a kindergarten and a primary school in Cu Khe, Vietnam. Each system comprised a painted galvanized iron roof, a first-flush diverter, two stainless steel tanks connected in series, a calmed inlet, mosquito screens on open holes, PVC pipelines, filter cartridges, and a UV sterilizer. During 18 months, stored rainwater was sampled five times, and treated rainwater was sampled four times. Twenty-three water quality parameters were analyzed, including pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, hardness, arsenic, iron, cadmium, nickel, chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, lead, zinc, Escherichia coli, and total coliform. It was found that all the physicochemical qualities of the stored rainwater, prior to treatment, satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. After physical filtration and UV sterilization, all parameters, including microbiological indicators, satisfied the WHO drinking water guidelines. Further management strategies to stabilize water quality were discussed.	4.3
Sexual orientation can be accurately identified from photos of faces, but previous work has focused exclusively on straight versus gay and lesbian individuals. Across three studies, the current work investigated the facial perception of bisexual men and women, a less socially salient category. Although participants could identify straight and gay men at above-chance levels in a trichotomous categorization task, bisexual men were categorized only at chance (Study 1). Participants perceived bisexual men to be significantly different from straight men, but not gay men (Study 2). Similarly, whereas bisexual and lesbian women were not rated differently, both groups were distinguishable from straight female targets (Study 3). These findings suggest a straight-non straight dichotomy in the categorization of sexual orientation.	2.2
Autonomy and adaptability are key features of intelligent agents. Many applications of intelligent agents, such as the control of ambient intelligence environments and autonomous intelligent robotic systems, require the processing of information coming in from many available sensors to produce adequate output responses in changing scenarios. Autonomy, in these cases, applies not only to the ability of the agent to produce correct outputs without human guidance, but also to its ubiquity and/or portability, low-power consumption and integrability. In this sense, an embedded electronic system implementation paradigm can be applied to the design of autonomous intelligent agents in order to satisfy the above mentioned characteristics. However, processing complex computational intelligence algorithms with tight delay constraints in resource-constrained and low power embedded systems is a challenging engineering problem. In this paper a single-chip intelligent agent based on a computationally efficient neuro-fuzzy information processing core is described. The system has been endowed with an information preprocessing module based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that permits a substantial reduction of the input space dimensionality with little loss of modeling capability. Moreover, the PCA module has been tested as a means to achieve deep adaptability in changing environment dynamics and to endow the agent with fault tolerance in the presence of sensor failures. For data driven trials and research, a data set obtained from an experimental intelligent inhabited environment has been used as a benchmark system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.0
This paper proposes a new method of decoupling and subdividing electrical circuits, containing power-electronics devices, in order to achieve fast and accurate real-time simulation. In this technique, each state variable can be discretized using different discretization methods. Combining implicit and explicit ODE solvers, state-space equations are decoupled while remaining accurate and stable. Unlike most traditional decoupling techniques previously proposed, the proposed one does not require artificial delay or supplementary states to be added in order to decouple the system. Furthermore, this technique is meant to be implemented with commercially available simulation software. By doing so, a large and complex circuit containing several hundreds of state variables can be easily and accurately simulated with minor modification to the existing models. Finally, stability and accuracy of the proposed technique are thoroughly demonstrated in a numerical example during steady state and under faulty conditions.	1.2
Grouted connections (GCs) have been extensively used in offshore applications over the last decades and are widely used today in offshore monopile wind turbines. The effectiveness of the connections on monopiles was questioned recently after several substructures were reported to have insufficient performance in wind farms over Europe. This paper brings together the current practice in terms of engineering methods used for the determination of loads acting on the structure and the numerical methods used for the investigation of the structural behaviour of the GC. With respect to hydrodynamic loads on monopile wind turbines, the popular linear wave theory along with the Morison equation can be used to model normal sea states, whereas higher-order wave models are necessary to investigate severe events such as wave breaking. In terms of wind loads, blade element momentum proves to be advantageous with respect to computational cost and ease of implementation in simulation tools. Finally, finite-element modelling of GCs is introduced and close attention is given to the non-linearity of the grout material and the interface contact which are considered to be decisive aspects for the structural analysis.	3.1
In the midst of rising tension between China and Japan, two powerful countries in Asia, the favorable attitudes of each country's citizens toward the other country have dropped to a historical low. The Taiwan issue, historical legacy, island disputes, and maritime resource competition are major obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations, but the most fundamental issue is a deep-seated mutual distrust and suspicion between the two countries, which result in rising threat perceptions. Beyond the structural and political elite-centered approaches, this study examines the evidence related to the three approaches (face-to-face contact, cross-cultural exposure, and social identity) to reduce mutual distrust and antipathy in the two countries. With a careful analysis of the survey data, this study sheds light on the conditions under which contact (a) results in improved attitudes toward outgroup, (b) has little or no effect on intergroup relations, and (c) yields more prejudice and hostility toward the outgroup. The findings of this study not only identify factors that could facilitate mutual understanding between Chinese and Japanese people and more favorable impressions of one another, but are also relevant to planning interventions to reduce prejudice and distrust among people from different races, religions, and countries.	2.0
Background: Cognitive interventions (either restorative or compensatory) developed for mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have been tested widely with cognitive measures, but less is known about how the effects of such interventions are generalizable to daily functioning. In the present study, we looked at affective state and perceived functionality and quality of life indicators, for three different cognitive rehabilitation programs. Methods: Fifty-one AD patients in the mild stage of the disease were selected for the study and were randomly assigned to one of three cognitive training groups: (1) Memo+ (a paper and pencil memory training program); (2) SenseCam (wearable camera used as a passive external memory aid); (3) Written diary (a personal journal, used as control condition). All patients attended 11 sessions, twice a week, of 1-hour length. The three outcome indicators were examined with standardized instruments applied before the intervention, one week after and at six months follow-up. Results: After treatment, the SenseCam and Memo+ groups had significantly reduced depressive symptoms compared to the Diary control condition. The same was found for measures of perceived functional capacity. No intervention effects were found for quality of life measures. The immediate effects of the interventions were not maintained at follow-up. Conclusions: Our results suggest that two types of memory rehabilitation can improve depressive symptomology and instrumental activities of daily living, suggesting that these interventions can stimulate not only cognition but also well-being, at least in the short term.	5.2
The distribution of water pollution is often assessed by remote sensing. In this study, we develop a fuzzy multiple regression model and analyze water quality using data collected by the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type-2 (AVNIR-2) of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite at different time points. We conduct a fuzzy multiple regression analysis of the AVNIR-2 data and direct measurements of the local water quality of Lake Hachiroko in Japan. The relationship between the AVNIR-2 and water quality data are analyzed by solving both min and max problems. We compare the estimated water quality maps with the actual distributions in the study area, and determine that the proposed method enables us to derive water quality conditions effectively from the AVNIR-2 data. Furthermore, by comparing maps created using AVNIR-2 data collected at different times, we obtain results revealing temporal changes in water quality. In addition, we compare maps created using the fuzzy multiple regression and fuzzy regression models. We demonstrate that the former offers a greater number of solutions and provides more details about water quality.	4.4
Little is known about the health effects of school-related indoor dampness and microbial exposures. In this study, we investigated dampness and dampness-related agents in both homes and schools and their association with allergy and respiratory health effects in 330 Danish pupils. Classroom dampness was identified based on technical inspection and bedroom dampness on parents' self-report. Classroom and bedroom dust was analyzed for seven microbial components. Skin prick testing determined atopic sensitization. Lung function was expressed as z-scores for forced expiratory volume in one-second (zFEV(1)), forced vital capacity (zFVC) and the ratio zFEV(1)/zFVC using GLI-2012 prediction equations. The parents reported children's allergies, airway symptoms, and doctor-diagnosed asthma. High classroom dampness, but not bedroom dampness, was negatively associated with zFEV(1) (-coef. -0.71; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.23) and zFVC (-coef. -0.52; 95% CI -0.98 to -0.06) and positively with wheezing (OR 8.09; 95% CI 1.49 to 43.97). No consistent findings were found between any individual microbial components or combination of microbial components and health outcomes. Among other indoor risk factors, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) decreased zFEV(1) (-coef. -0.22; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.02) and zFEV(1)/zFVCratio (-coef. -0.26; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.07) and increased upper airway symptoms (OR 1.66; 95% CI 1.03-2.66). In conclusion, dampness in classrooms may have adverse respiratory health effects in pupils, but microbial agents responsible for this effect remain unknown.	5.1
The reported digital thermionic emission current controllers use floating voltage sources which produce noise current and consequently decrease the quality of an electron beam. The implementation of digital control in an electron source biasing system without floating sources gives the average value of the electron emission current standard deviation of 0.015%. The described controller has been developed in order to investigate the properties of new hot-emitters.	1.4
Uncontrolled anthropogenic activities and technological revolution increase fossil fuel consumption at higher rate that prompted researchers looking for alternative energy source to cover the current need and future demand of energy. Biomass of terrestrial crops has been studied as a promising source of renewable energy in last few decades however large scale production is still questionable because of lower productivity, indirect use of fossil fuel, lack of land availability and food vs. fuel conflict. These limitations of land based system fetch opportunity to look into untapped potential use of microalgae with high biomass productivity from saline and waste water stream. This unconventional way of feedstock generation can additionally produce value added products apart from clean energy. This review presents current scenario of microalgae applications in biofuel production and micro algae based high value bio-product industries leveraging environmental protection and waste utilization benefits. Microalgae cultivation, harvesting and biomass conversion technologies for biodiesel production have been reviewed based on adapting ancient learning to understand critical factors affecting overall productivity and economic viability. Dedicated efforts from technical experts are still required for economic viability of large scale biodiesel production in spite of positive finding at small scale. Several high value bio-products from microalgae amplified magnetism of trades for investment in this field. Microalgae cultivation intersects two key concern areas of global warming and water pollution control/water recycling by CO2 sequestration and waste water utilization respectively. Integration of suitable upstream and downstream processing technologies with multiple product portfolio would make the microalgae bio-refinery economical viable.	4.4
Objective: To examine emotion processing in euthymic bipolar patients (EBP) compared to healthy controls. In addition, to determine whether or not there is an association between emotion processing and psychosocial functioning. Material and methods: A sample of 60 EBP and 60 healthy controls matched for age, gender, education level, and premorbid intelligence were studied. All subjects were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and two additional executive function measures: the Trail Making Test-Part B and the Stroop Test. Emotion processing was examined using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST). Results: Euthymic bipolar patients obtained lower scores than controls in all MSCEIT measures except for the using emotions branch. Likewise, EBP obtained a worse performance than healthy controls in all neurocognitive domains. Correlation between MSCEIT strategic area measures and FAST total score was found (r = -0.311; P < 0.016). Regression analysis showed that residual depressive symptomatology explains a 9.1% of the variance in functional outcome. MSCEIT strategic area score explained an additional 8.6%. Neurocognition did not increase the percentage of the variance explained by emotion processing. Conclusions: Euthymic bipolar patients exhibit deficits in emotion processing. Emotion processing is associated with social functioning in these patients.	2.1
Water pollution by organic materials or metals is one of the problems that threaten humanity, both nowadays and over the next decades. Morphological changes in Nile Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus fish liver and gills can also represent the adaptation strategies to maintain some physiological functions or to assess acute and chronic exposure to chemicals found in water and sediments. This paper presents an automatic system for assessing water quality, in Sharkia Governorate- Egypt, based on microscopic images of fish gills and liver. The proposed system used fish gills and liver as hybrid-biomarker in order to detect water pollution. It utilized case-based reasoning (CBR) for indicating the degree of water quality based on the different histopathological changes in fish gills and liver microscopic images. Various performance evaluation metrics namely, retrieval accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, F-measure, and G-mean have been used in order to objectively indicate the true performance of the system considering the unbalanced data. Experimental results showed that the proposed hybrid-biomarker CBR based system achieved water quality prediction accuracy of 97.9% using cosine distance similarity measure. Also, it outperformed both SVMs and LDA classifiers for the tested microscopic images dataset. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.4
The present report describes the planning and surgery as well as pitfalls and management of a patient with a near total mandibular avulsion injury that was rehabilitated using three-dimensional (3D) laser printing of a titanium lower jaw. Laser-sintering involves zapping layers of powdered metal to recreate a 3D implantable skeletal defect. The process involves using either mirror imaging of the unaffected side or using archival image database of healthy individuals. A 25-year-old man presented with a gunshot injury that left him with a near total avulsed mandible. The patient received state-of-the-art treatment using a laser 3D printed mandible which was connected to the muscles of mastication for functionality. The inner side of the titanium jaw was filled with the patient's comminuted fractured bones in addition to harvested iliac crest bone graft that was covered with the patient's remaining periosteal tissue. The implantation of a near total mandible using 3D laser printing is a fast and predictable process that in selected patients can result in aesthetically as well as functionally excellent results.

Attempts at idea generation often produce outputs that are marked by restricted creativity. This lack of originality is often due to responses being tethered to recently activated knowledge and salient examples. The current research tested the hypothesis that implicitly priming creativity results in more creativity (i.e., flexibility). Experiment 1 addressed the potential underlying mechanisms that might lead to such an effect and demonstrated that creativity priming leads to the activation of remote, as opposed to close, associations to a target item. Experiments 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 showed that priming creativity (using two different procedures) leads to more original ideas in a generative task as well as better performance in the remote association task (RAT). These effects occurred independently of the conscious intention to be creative as well as motivational and mood states. Across these studies, the activation of a creative mindset undermined the sources of inflexible and uncreative responding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.2
This article presents a laboratory module developed for undergraduate micro/nano engineering laboratory courses in the mechanical engineering departments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and King Fand University of Petroleum and Minerals. In this laboratory, students fabricate superoleophobic membranes by spray-coating of titania nanoparticles on steel meshes, characterize the surfaces and ability of the membrane to retain oil, and then use these membranes to separate an oil-water mixture. The laboratory module covers nanomaterials, nanomanufacturing, materials characterization, and understanding of the concepts of surface tension and hydrostatics, with oil-water separation as an application. The laboratory experiments are easy to set up based on commercially available tools and materials, which will facilitate implementation of this module in other educational institutions. The significance of oil-water separation in the petroleum industry and integration of concepts from fluid mechanics in the laboratory module will help to illustrate the relevance of nanotechnology to mechanical and materials engineering and its potential to address some of the future societal needs.	3.4

So the method of confirming the indicator-weight based on the theory of entropy lies in information is given. Further more, the model of supplier selection is build up. Finally, the simulative example is given. It illustrates the method avail to select the supplier to enhance the enterprise. competence.	3.2
The yield forecasting of corn constitutes a key issue in agricultural management, particularly in the context of demographic pressure and climate change. This study presents two methods to estimate yields using artificial neural networks: a diagnostic approach based on all the satellite data acquired throughout the agricultural season, and a real-time approach, where estimates are updated after each image was acquired in the microwave and optical domains (Formosat-2, Spot-4/5, TerraSAR-X, and Radarsat-2) throughout the crop cycle. The results are based on the Multispectral Crop Monitoring experimental campaign conducted by the CESBIO (Centre d'Etudes de la BIOsphere) laboratory in 2010 over an agricultural region in southwestern France. Among the tested sensor configurations (multi-frequency, multi-polarization or multi-source data), the best yield estimation performance (using the diagnostic approach) is obtained with reflectance acquired in the red wavelength region, with a coefficient of determination of 0.77 and an RMSE of 6.6 q ha(-1). in the real-time approach the combination of red reflectance and C-HH backscattering coefficients provides the best compromise between the accuracy and earliness of the yield estimate (more than 3 months before the harvest), with an R-2 of 0.69 and an RMSE of 7.0 q ha-1 during the development of the central stem. The two best yield estimates are similar in most cases (for more than 80% of the monitored fields), and the differences are related to discrepancies in the crop growth cycle and/or the consequences of pests.

In this paper we propose an ecological view in which a smart home is seen as an interconnected collection of smart objects that work together to provide services to inhabitants. We review home technologies in a historical context in which the home is a personal habitat that provides services to inhabitants, and draw lessons from the profusion of new services that were made possible by the introduction of electricity in the home during the 20th century. We examine possible metaphors for smart homes, including the smart home as an inside-out autonomous robot, and the smart home as an ecosystem of smart objects providing services. We propose a taxonomy for smart home services and discuss examples for each class of service. We conclude with a discussion of required system qualities and potential show-stoppers.	4.0
In ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients, cardiac and vascular involvement may manifest as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol constitute a significant risk for atherosclerosis. This study investigated the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), LDL/HDL ratio, total oxidant status (TOS; an indicator of oxidative stress) and ischemic modified albumin (IMA; an ischemic marker in AS patients). Sixty AS patients were diagnosed using the Modified New York Criteria; 54 age- and gender-matched participants were included as controls. CIMT, LDL/HDL ratio, TOS and IMA were measured using the most appropriate methods. IMA was higher in AS patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001). TOS was also increased in AS patients (p = 0.005); as was CIMT (p < 0.0001). The LDL/HDL ratio was also greater in AS patients compared to controls (p = 0.047). A positive correlation was found between CIMT and LDL/HDL ratio among AS patients. Elevated CIMT, IMA and TOS levels suggest an increased risk of atherosclerotic heart disease in AS patients. The LDL/HDL ratio was higher in AS patients compared to controls, and there was a correlation between LDL/HDL ratio and CIMT, albeit statistically weak. Therefore, the LDL/HDL ratio is not a reliable marker to predict atherosclerotic heart disease in AS patients.	5.3
Geosynthetics have been commonly used as reinforcement layers to bridge over underground cavities, sinkholes, and trenches to support upper soil mass. In such applications, the geosynthetics, acting as tensioned membranes plus the effect of soil arching, maintain the stability and mitigate the subsidence of the overlying soil. This study, including a two-dimensional experimental testing and subsequent numerical simulations, investigates the subsidence of the soil mass and deformation of the geosynthetics over a roadway subdrain. The experimental study was performed in a fabricated container with 7 trapdoors (125 mm each) at the bottom. One of the trapdoors was lowered to mimic a trench for subdrain. Cylindrical aluminum bars were used as soil in the experimental testing to imitate the two-dimensional (2D) situations. A layer of geotextile was placed underneath the soil fill to serve as the reinforcement. Following the experimental test, a numerical simulation was carried out, using Discrete Element Method, PFC2D, to extend the scope of the experimental study. The results indicated that (1) the deformed shape of the geosynthetic layer is approximately parabolic, (2) the subsidence was decreased hyperbolically in the vertical direction and the lateral influence range appeared to be bounded by two lines inclined at (45 degrees + phi/2), and (3) the friction angle showed significant influence on subsidence and tension in geosynthetic.

The Atlantic Bluefin tuna (BFT, Thunnus thynnus), one of the largest top-predator fish inhabiting the pelagic ecosystems of the North Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, has been extensively overexploited in recent decades. However, in the Mediterranean Sea, the mixing rates between the eastern, central and western basins have not yet been fully and finally resolved. To date electronic tagging, otolith and genetic markers cannot still disentangle the pattern of tuna movements and population structuring in the basin, essential background for a proper management of BFT fisheries. Here, we used Expressed Sequence Tag-linked (EST-linked) microsatellites to explore population dynamics and adaptive evolution of Mediterranean T. thynnus. For this purpose, 16 EST-linked microsatellites were genotyped in 177 tuna individuals from the Mediterranean Sea and several methods were used to explore population genetic structuring and estimate/detect signals of local adaptation. Bayesian clustering results indicated the presence of a single cluster, corroborated also by the Correspondence Analysis and pairwise Fsrs. Similarly, the two methods used for the detection of outlier loci (LOSITAN and BayeScan), did not reveal any pattern suggesting the presence of selective pressure on the EST Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) used. Our results suggest that the low level of polymorphism detected in this study could be ascribed to the presence of relatively conserved regions flanking these microsatellites. These genomic regions are probably not involved in physiological responses to local adaptation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	6.4
The high-speed (HS) electric machines are gaining attention in several different applications, and the development of advanced materials, electronic components, and control algorithms is pushing ahead the technological speed limits. In the electromagnetic sizing of HS machines, the mechanical and thermal involvements are very tight to make it necessary to deal with all the different aspects at the same time. This paper aims to summarize and discuss the electrical and the mechanical aspects involved in the HS machine design, highlighting the main issues and the tradeoffs that the designer has to consider. Furthermore, the correlation between volume reduction and speed increase, based on commercial high-frequency rotor-stator units, is also presented.	3.3
Objectives: Most young adults transition from childhood dental care to adult dental care without problems. However, a substantial minority leaves childhood dental care with considerable fear of dental treatment. In the present study, we hypothesized that fear of dental treatment in the young adult is influenced by memories of positive and negative childhood experiences with dental care. More specifically, we predicted that the emotional impact, sense of reliving, rehearsal, and belief in the accuracy of a negative treatment memory would be associated with increased dental fear, while positive treatment memories would show the opposite relation. Methods: One hundred thirty-six young adults leaving childhood dental care responded to a online measures of dental fear, the most negative and most positive memory of dental treatment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Results: Negative memories of events that involved pain and dentist behaviors such as impatience or scolding were frequently described and significantly associated with dental fear and symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Positive memories were more frequent, but did not show a consistent relationship with dental fear. Conclusions: The importance of negative memories suggests an avenue for intervention against dental fear that focuses on restructuring those memories to emphasize positive aspects.	5.4
The triacylglycerols of Crepis alpina oil were characterized because this oil has a high concentration of crepenynic (cis-9-odadecen-12-ynoic) acid, a fatty acid useful in the chemical synthesis of deuterated fats for human metabolism studies. The triacylglycerols were separated from the crude oil by solid-phase extraction. Resolution, quantitation and isolation of the individual triacylglycerols were performed by silver ion high-performance liquid chromatography on a commercial column, an acetonitrile in hexane isocratic mobile phase and flame-ionization detection. Isolated triacylglycerols were identified by capillary gas chromatography of their fatty acid methyl esters. Of the eleven eluted triacylglycerols of Crepis alpina oil, 85% included 35% tricrepenynoyl, 34% linoleoyldicrepenynoyl and 16% dilinoleoylcrepenynoyl glycerols. Triacylglycerols eluted according to the numbers of alkene and alkyne bonds. Elution times, resolution and quantitation were reproducible over a three-month period. The flame-ionization detector response required no response factors for quantitation of the triacylglycerols present in Crepis alpina oil. The silver ion chromatography system permitted the identification of 95% of the triacylglycerols compared to 70% of the triacylglycerols previously identified with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.	6.2
The One-vs-One strategy is among the most used techniques to deal with multi-class problems in Machine Learning. This way, any binary classifier can be used to address the original problem, since one classifier is learned for each possible pair of classes. As in every ensemble method, classifier combination becomes a vital step in the classification process. Even though many combination models have been developed in the literature, none of them have dealt with the possibility of reducing the number of generated classifiers after the training phase, i.e., ensemble pruning, since every classifier is supposed to be necessary. On this account, our objective in this paper is two-fold: (1) We propose a transformation of the aggregation step, which lead us to a new combination strategy where instances are classified on the basis of the similarities among score-matrices. (2) This fact allows us to introduce the possibility of reducing the number of binary classifiers without affecting the final accuracy. We will show that around 50% of classifiers can be removed (depending on the base learner and the specific problem) and that the confidence degrees obtained by these base classifiers have a strong influence on the improvement in the final accuracy. A thorough experimental study is carried out in order to show the behavior of the proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art combination models in the One-vs-One strategy. Different classifiers from various Machine Learning paradigms are considered as base classifiers and the results obtained are contrasted with the proper statistical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Within the framework of EUROfusion Program, the Dual Coolant Lithium Lead (DCLL) is one of the four EU breeder blanket concepts that are being investigated as candidates for DEMO. DCLL uses PbLi as the main coolant, tritium breeder, tritium carrier, and neutron multiplier. The main structures, including the first wall, are cooled with helium. The EU program proposed for the next years will consider a DCLL version limited to 550 degrees C in order to allow the use of conventional materials and technologies. During the first year of EUROfusion activities, a draft design of the DCLL has been proposed. The main blanket performances were adapted to the new specifications and the CAD model of DEMO. The breeder zone has been toroidally divided into four parallel PbLi circuits, separated through stiffening grid radial walls. The PbLi flow routing has been designed to maximize the amount of thermal power extracted by flowing PbLi and to avoid the occurrence of reverse flows due to volumetric heating. Thermal hydraulics, magnetohydrodynamic and neutronics calculations have been performed for the first draft design. The new DCLL design employs Eurofer-alumina-Eurofer sandwich as flow channel insert (FCI).	3.1
Green roofs have been proposed as a way to mitigate stormwater run-off in urban areas due to the possibility of retrofit to existing buildings. The amount of run-off is influenced by the, humidity, evapotranspiration, as well as soil type and depth. A modelling approach was undertaken to evaluate the response of different soil depths to cumulative rainfall and the efficiency in stormwater flow rate attenuation. The soil hydraulics were modelled using HYDRUS-1D software developed for modelling water flow in variably saturated porous media. Model runs were carried out for three quarterly scenarios to determine run-off peak flow rates and the overall retention, based on evapotranspiration rates of succulent plants and rainfall registers from Auckland, New Zealand. The soil depths modelled ranged from 5 to 160 cm. The efficiencies in peak flow attenuation by the shallowest soil considered were reduced under extreme and longer rainfall events by 3%. Therefore shallow soil or extensive green roofs may, on a wide scale, overcome the performance of deep soils due to their lighter weight which adds limited loads to existing roof structures thereby making them suited to retrofit greater numbers of buildings.

The implementation of cryptography algorithms is constantly observing threat from multiple techniques in breaking secure system. The current trend in breaking the secure system of cryptography is by power analysis technique. In order to break the secure key, the energy consumed in the digital circuit during computation is measured. This technique is commonly known as differential power analysis, explored by the hackers to break the secure systems. To circumvent these type of attacks, it is necessary to explore different designs, which dissipate less energy. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate zero energy. We present a new reversible architecture for greatest common divisor (GCD) computation using modified Binary GCD algorithm. We present the generalized design methodology of reversible GCD computation unit. We compare the proposed GCD computation design with the existing design. The proposed reversible GCD architecture takes less number of iterations compared with the existing GCD architecture in the literature. The proposed design outperforms the existing GCD design in terms of Quantum Cost, Gate Count, and Ancilla Inputs. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	0.3
As the course of computer operating system requires students to understand the interactions between computer systems, users and hardware platform, this paper concentrates on the problem of using the virtualization technology in computer operating system teaching. Particularly, virtualization technology is designed to simulate the real computer hardware environment, and then make the operating system run in a virtual computer environment. Because the virtual machine software can simulate real computer hardware equipment, several operating systems are supported, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Unix etc. The main idea of this paper is to utilize the VMware software in operating system teaching. VMware provides a completely virtualized set of hardware for a specific operating system. Afterwards, we discuss how to design and implement an experimental platform with multiple operating systems based on VMware.	0.4
Composites made fromrenewable sources have become important alternative materials for designing and manufacturing engineering and industrial products. Natural fiber composites have become superior materials compared to conventional fiber composites, due to their easy manufacturing process, high-fiber content, reduction in the polluting base content, lightweight, and incineration. Environmental cleanliness is an increasing concern to look for sustainable alternative materials that can replace conventional materials that are being used now. Natural fibers constitute a good alternative reinforcement material, since they are readily available in fibrous form, and can be extracted at very low costs. In the present study, environment friendly green composites have been prepared and the mechanical properties of these composites are evaluated. The results indicated a significant improvement in the tensile, flexural, and impact properties of the hybrid composites, and the effect of hybridization reduces the environmental effects. The internal structure of the broken surface, delamination of fibers, and the failure morphology are analyzed using the scanning electron microscopy analysis.	3.2
This paper discusses the luxury of dress and luxurious spaces from the perspective of aristocratic court society. Our modern bourgeois society often defines and morally condemns luxury as conspicuous and wasteful consumption beyond essential. But aristocratic and court society, during the feudal period regarded luxury as a crucial sign and fundamental tool of social status and political ambitions. The wedding celebrations of 1719 held at the Dresden court on the occasion of Augustus the Strong (1670-1733) marrying his son and heir, also called Frederick Augustus (1696-1763), to the archduchess Maria Josepha (1699-1757) are a fitting example of this understanding of luxury.	2.3
Fuel cell (FC)/lithium-ion battery hybrid power system (HPS) gradually becomes a powerful energy source in the future. This paper presents a digital boost converter for FC current regulation in the HPS with a dual-battery energy storage unit (ESU). The digital boost converter regulates the FC current in order to control the FC power generation. Simulations have been conducted in PSIM environment, and the digital controller is implemented with a Microchip dsPIC33FJ06GS202 16-bit microcontroller. Experimental results show that the efficiency of power conversion can reach to 85%.	1.4
Recently, cortisol has been suggested to moderate the positive relationship between testosterone and antisocial behavior. More precisely, high testosterone levels have been found to be related to aggressive or dominant behavior especially when cortisol levels were low. In the present study, we aimed to extend these findings to pro-environmental behavior as an indicator of prosocial behavior. In a first step, 147 male participants provided information on their everyday pro-environmental behavior by completing an online questionnaire on various energy-saving behaviors. In a second step, subjects provided two saliva samples for the assessment of testosterone and cortisol on two subsequent mornings after awakening. We found that testosterone was negatively related to pro-environmental behavior, but only in men with low cortisol. In conclusion, our findings provide first evidence for the joint association of testosterone and cortisol with everyday pro-environmental behavior. These results further reinforce the importance of considering interdependent hormone systems simultaneously rather than focusing on a single hormone.	2.4
New technologies have become an important support for the monitoring of older people in outdoor environments by their caregivers. Smart phones equipped with a rich set of powerful sensors allowed the ubiquitous human activity recognition on mobile platforms at a low cost. Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is an emergent area that provides useful mechanisms that allows tracking elderly people through opportunistic sensoring using smartphone devices. This paper aims to show the second version of SafeRoute, an AmI system that fusions geo-localization sensors data embedded in smartphone devices for the monitoring of elderly people. This version improves functionalities of the previous one with the inclusion of new ones in the two components of this system: the Android OS application CareofMe and the web system SafeRoute. The proposed system merges localization data from GPS and Wifi sensors data in Android OS and includes the use of GoogleMaps functionalities in Android OS and web environments for provide alerts for caregivers.	4.0
The theoretical and experimental analysis of a modified version of the SEPIC dc-dc converter used as preregulator operating in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) is presented in this paper. The proposed converter presents a low input current ripple operating in DCM, and the switch voltage is lower than the output voltage. The switch voltage reduction increases the converter reliability and a low drain-to-source on-resistance (RDSon) MOSFET can be used depending on the converter specification. Moreover, a digital control technique is applied to the proposed converter in order to reduce the third-harmonic input current distortion resultant of the operation in DCM. Finally, a 100-W prototype was developed operating with efficiency equal to 95.6%.	1.4
High performance, parallel applications with irregular data accesses are becoming a critical workload class for modern systems. In particular, the execution of such workloads on emerging many-core systems is expected to be a significant component of applications in data mining, machine learning, scientific computing and graph analytics. However, power and energy constraints limit the capabilities of individual cores, memory hierarchy and on-chip interconnect of such systems, thus leading to architectural and software trade-offs that must be understood in the context of the intended application's behavior. Irregular applications are notoriously hard to optimize given their data-dependent access patterns, lack of structured locality and complex data structures and code patterns. We have ported two irregular applications, graph community detection using the Louvain method (Grappolo) and high-performance conjugate gradient (HPCCG), to the Tilera many-core system and have conducted a detailed study of platform-independent and platform-specific optimizations that improve their performance as well as reduce their overall energy consumption. To conduct this study, we employ an auto-tuning based approach that explores the optimization design space along three dimensions memory layout schemes, GCC compiler flag choices and OpenMP loop scheduling options. We leverage MIT's OpenTuner auto-tuning framework to explore and recommend energy optimal choices for different combinations of parameters. We then conduct an in-depth architectural characterization to understand the memory behavior of the selected workloads. Finally, we perform a correlation study to demonstrate the interplay between the hardware behavior and application characteristics. Using auto-tuning, we demonstrate whole-node energy savings and performance improvements of up to 49.6% and 60% relative to a baseline instantiation, and up to 31% and 45.4% relative to manually optimized variants.

Community engagement of migrants has been identified as an important element in developing both individual well-being and cohesive multicultural receiving communities. Through 10 in-depth interviews, this study explores the profile of Moroccan migrant leaders in community organizations in the receiving context (south of Spain) and the reasons for which they engage. Moreover, it analyzes the relationship established between community engagement and their well-being. The results show that migrants commit for both intrinsic (e.g., support their compatriots) and extrinsic (e.g., increase their social connection) reasons. Their social action has a positive influence on their well-being because it activates the following paths: (1) improvement of bicultural competences; (2) development of social relationships with receiving members; (3) strengthening of social bonds with compatriots; (4) increase of abilities in dealing with unjust social conditions in the new environment; and (5) decrease of prejudice towards their own cultural group.	2.0
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative condition, clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and gradual impairment of cognitive functions. Bapineuzumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to neurotoxic amyloid proteins in the brain, enhancing their clearance. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Methods: We performed a web-based literature search of PubMed, Ovid, EBSCO, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and web of science using the relevant keywords. Data were extracted from eligible records and pooled as mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) values with their 95% confidence interval (CI), using Review Manager software (version 5.3 for windows). Heterogeneity was measured by Chi-square and I-square tests. Result: The pooled effect estimate from six randomized clinical trials (n = 2380) showed that bapineuzumab significantly reduced the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of phosphorylated tau proteins (Standardized MD = -5.53, 95% CI [-8.29, -2.76]). However, the bapineuzumab group was not superior to the placebo group in terms of change from baseline in Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)-Cog11 (MD = 0.14, 95% CI [-0.72, 0.99]), disability assessment for dementia (DAD) scale (MD = 1.35, 95% CI [-1.74, 4.43]), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores (MD = 0.08, 95% CI [-0.31, 0.47]). Regarding safety, bapineuzumab increased the risk of serious treatment-emergent adverse events (RR = 1.18, 95% CI [1.02, 1.37]) and cerebral vasogenic edema (RR = 40.88, 95% CI [11.94, 135. 95]). All bapineuzumab doses (0.15, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) were similar to placebo in terms of change from baseline in ADAS-cog11, DAD, and MMSE scores, except for the 0.15 mg/kg dose, which caused a significant worsening on the ADAS-cog11 scale (MD = 5.6, 95% CI [0.22, 10.98]). Conclusions: Considering the lack of clinical efficacy, combined with the significant association with serious adverse events, bapineuzumab should not be used to treat patients with mild to moderate AD. Future studies should investigate the effect of combining bapineuzumab with other therapeutic strategies and reevaluate the efficacy of targeting amyloid beta proteins in AD therapy.	5.2
This paper introduces an integrated magnetic gear intended as direct-drive. Next, a magnetic equivalent circuit for the presented gear topology is proposed. This approach uses the principle of virtual work for torque calculation and takes magnetic leakage and saturation into account. Thereby, the approach focuses on a reduction of the computation time compared to finite element simulation. Finally, the suggested approach is verified by the results of a finite element simulation.	3.3
The methods used to analyze the slope stability are commonly based on limit equilibrium theory and are expressed in terms of a factor of safety. However, an analysis that approaches the variability of the soil parameters and model uncertainties becomes necessary. In this paper, a pre-designed reinforcement slope available on the technical literature was chosen to a probabilistic analysis. The statistic information about the parameters was found in the literature and the numerical simulations were done in the software SLOPE/W. Besides, a parametric analysis was done varying the coefficient of variability of unit weight and friction angle to investigate the effect of the variability on the reliability of the slope. Also, the contribution of water level was measured. The results show relevant variation on the reliability index with the parametric analysis, indicating the importance of this study. Furthermore, the water level has a decisive impact on safety and reliability of the slope. Lastly, the reinforcement with geotextiles was efficient to increase the safety of slopes.	4.1
Background: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by an accumulation of immune cells in the duodenal mucosa as a consequence of both adaptive and innate immune responses to undigested gliadin peptides. Mast cells (MCs) are innate immune cells that are a major source of costimulatory signals and inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa. Although MCs have previously been associated with CD, functional studies have never been performed. Objective: We aimed at evaluating the role of MCs in the pathogenesis of CD. Methods: Intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with CD were scored according to the Marsh classification and characterized for leukocyte infiltration and MC distribution. Moreover, MC reactivity to gliadin and its peptides was characterized by using in vitro assays. Results: Infiltrating MCs were associated with the severity of mucosal damage, and their numbers were increased in patients with higher Marsh scores. MCs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Immunohistochemical characterization of infiltrating MCs and the effects of gliadin peptides on intestinal MCs indicated an increase in proinflammatory MC function in advanced stages of the disease. This was also associated with increased neutrophil accumulation, the prevalence of M1 macrophages, and the severity of tissue damage. Conclusion: We provide a description of the progressive stages of CD, in which MCs are the hallmark of the inflammatory process. Thus the view of CD should be revised, and the contribution of MCs in the onset and progression of CD should be reconsidered in developing new therapeutic approaches.	6.3
Internships are becoming an overall part of engineering curricula as a cooperative learning initiative and an attractive bridge for students to enter labor market. The stakeholders' role is analyzed and their interactions outlined in order to raise the main drivers or preference factors of every participant in the process. Disparity in the assessment of the internship can be a source of disaffection reducing the a priori attractiveness of the stage and the potential contribution to students learning. Based on different scales of values or aims, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is partially used to put a rationale in the frequently contradictory objectives of the stakeholders. The new concept of alignment helps to it. A simulated case study illustrates the use of the methodology and other potential applications in the internship management process are proposed.

A significant role in kinesiology classes involving students suffering from hearing impairments is played by communication with these students. The aim is to improve their communication skills, encouraging them to use the best mode of communication, creating the opportunities for socialization and for the integration process (games, physical therapy lesson, and others). The role of the teacher is to transmit knowledge to pupils in a specific language. Due to the particularities of the pupils, the verbal communication in class may be accompanied by nonverbal communication, visual and symbols. Expressive didactic communication involves such elements as the teacher's attitude, way of dressing and motor behavior, facial expression, use of certain gestures, symbols or video, as well as use of permanent eye contact with students throughout classes. This research aims at highlighting the types of communication (verbal, nonverbal, visual and symbols) that may significance contribute to an effective communication in kinesiology classes.

In the context of globalwarming, it is important to understand the drivers controlling river temperature in order to mitigate temperature increases. A modeling approach can be useful for quantifying the respective importance of the different drivers, notably groundwater inputs and riparian shadingwhich are potentially critical for reducing summer temperature. In this study, we use a one-dimensional deterministicmodel to predict summer water temperature at an hourly time step over a 21 km reach of the lower Ain River ( France). This sinuous gravel-bed river undergoes summer temperature increase with potential impacts on salmonid populations. The model considers heat fluxes at the water-air interface, attenuation of solar radiation by riparian forest, groundwater inputs and hydraulic characteristics of the river. Modeling is performed over two periods of five days during the summers 2010 and 2011. River properties are obtained from hydraulic modeling based on cross-section profiles and water level surveys. Wemodel shadows of the vegetation on the river surface using LiDAR data. Groundwater inputs are determined using airborne thermal infrared (TIR) images and hydrological data. Results indicate that vegetation and groundwater inputs canmitigate highwater temperatures during summer. Riparian shading effect is fairly similar between the two periods (- 0.26 +/- 0.12 degrees C and - 0.31 +/- 0.18 degrees C). Groundwater input cooling is variable between the two studied periods: when groundwater discharge represents 16% of the river discharge, it cools the river down by 0.68 +/- 0.13 degrees Cwhile the effect is very low( 0.11 +/- 0.01 degrees C) when the groundwater discharge contributes only 2% to the discharge. The effect of shading varies through the day: low in the morning and high during the afternoon and the evening whereas those induced by groundwater inputs is more constant through the day. Overall, the effect of riparian vegetation and groundwater inputs represents about 10% in 2010 and 24% in 2011 of water temperature diurnal amplitudes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.2
In this paper, the development of a polarimetric phased array weather radar, which consists of a dual-polarized antenna with 2-D circular planar phase-array elements, is discussed. The radar is capable of measuring the 3-D rainfall distribution in less than several tens of seconds. Digital beam-forming (DBF) is an important component in the development process of the phased array radar. In this paper, precipitation radar signal simulations are performed taking into consideration radar concepts in order to discuss the estimation accuracy of polarimetric precipitation profiles (differential reflectivity, specific differential phase, and copolar correlation coefficient) with two DBF methods that are based on Fourier and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) methods. A comparison of the performance of the two methods indicates that MMSE is superior in accuracy because of the effect of a stable and a robust main lobe and adaptively suppressed side lobes. MMSE also provides precipitation measurements eliminating the directional dependence of a beam pattern for improving the accuracy of measurements. It is also shown that the estimated accuracies of the precipitation profiles are almost independent of the number of pulses.	4.2
Evolution of melanoma from a primary tumor to widespread metastasis is crucially dependent on lymphatic spread. The mechanisms regulating the initial step in metastatic dissemination via regional lymph nodes remain largely unknown; however, evidence supporting the establishment of a pre-metastatic niche is evolving. We have previously described a dysfunctional immune profile including reduced expression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation markers in the first node draining from the primary tumor, the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Importantly, this phenotype is present prior to evidence of nodal metastasis. Herein, we evaluate melanoma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as potential mediators of the premetastatic niche through cargo-specific polarization of DCs. DCs matured in vitro in the presence of melanoma EVs demonstrated significantly impaired expression of CD83 and CD86 as well as decreased expression of Th1 polarizing chemokines FIt3L and IL15 and migration chemokines MIP-l alpha and MIP-1 beta compared to liposome-treated DCs. Profiling of melanoma EV cargo identified shared proteomic and RNA signatures including S100A8 and S100A9 protein cargo, which in vitro compromised DC maturation similar to melanoma EVs. Early evidence demonstrates that similar EVs can be isolated from human afferent lymphatic fluid ex vivo. Taken together, here, we propose melanoma EV cargo as a mechanism by which DC maturation is compromised warranting further study to consider this as a potential mechanism enabled by the primary tumor to establish the premetastatic niche in tumor-draining SLNs of patients.	6.3
Background: Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains incomplete. Previous studies have revealed that genetic factors provide a significant contribution to the pathogenesis and development of AD. In the past years, numerous genes implicated in this disease have been identified via genetic association studies on candidate genes or at the genome-wide level. However, in many cases, the roles of these genes and their interactions in AD are still unclear. A comprehensive and systematic analysis focusing on the biological function and interactions of these genes in the context of AD will therefore provide valuable insights to understand the molecular features of the disease. Method: In this study, we collected genes potentially associated with AD by screening publications on genetic association studies deposited in PubMed. The major biological themes linked with these genes were then revealed by function and biochemical pathway enrichment analysis, and the relation between the pathways was explored by pathway crosstalk analysis. Furthermore, the network features of these AD-related genes were analyzed in the context of human interactome and an AD-specific network was inferred using the Steiner minimal tree algorithm. Results: We compiled 430 human genes reported to be associated with AD from 823 publications. Biological theme analysis indicated that the biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment, metabolism, cell growth and/or survival, and immunology were enriched in these genes. Pathway crosstalk analysis then revealed that the significantly enriched pathways could be grouped into three interlinked modules-neuronal and metabolic module, cell growth/survival and neuroendocrine pathway module, and immune response-related module-indicating an AD-specific immune-endocrine-neuronal regulatory network. Furthermore, an AD-specific protein network was inferred and novel genes potentially associated with AD were identified. Conclusion: By means of network and pathway-based methodology, we explored the pathogenetic mechanism underlying AD at a systems biology level. Results from our work could provide valuable clues for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying AD. In addition, the framework proposed in this study could be used to investigate the pathological molecular network and genes relevant to other complex diseases or phenotypes.	5.2
Heavy metal migration was evaluated in Pb-Zn tailings covered by different topsoil constructions. The four topsoil constructions each had different interlayers: one with direct topsoiling above the tailings (CT); the second had a limestone interlayer between the tailings and topsoil with two geotextile layers set above and below the interlayer (SLS); the third had a lime interlayer, also with two geotextile layers (SL); and the fourth had a clay interlayer with two geotextile layers (SC). The topsoils were evaluated in a 210-day laboratory column leaching experiments and in a 3-year field cover application at an abandoned Pb-Zn tailings pond (northeastern China). The contents of Pb, Zn and Cd in the soils, leachates, interlayers and leaves of Amotpha fruticosa L were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Results showed that the pH values of the leachates from the columns increased with time, from 6.5 to the range of 7.5 to 8.03, and the maximum in pH in Cl (tailings), C2 (CT), C3 (SLS), C4 (SL) and C5 (SC) appeared after the 180th day, at 7.85, 7.89, 7.78, 8.03, and 7.89, respectively. The topsoil effectively reduced the concentrations of Pb, Zn and Cd in the leachate, and the addition of a limestone or lime interlayer enhanced the efficiency, especially for Zn and Cd. The Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in the topsoil that directly cover the tailings were appreciably less than the initial concentrations, resulting from the eluviation. The presence of a limestone or lime interlayer reduced the mobility of Zn and Cd, and a clay interlayer was effective in preventing the migration of Pb and Zn but had less impact on Cd. During the 3-year field experiment, the pH values of the topsoil increased slightly with time, from 7.15 to the range of 7.67 to 820. At the end of the experiment, Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations in the topsoil at the SLS, SL and SC plots showed little change compared with the initial value in 2012. Acid-soluble Pb, Zn and Cd concentrations of the upper soil (0-0.1 m) at CT increased from 0.19, 1.95 and 0.11 mg kg(-1) in 2012 to 1.82, 32.87 and 0.56 mg kg(-1) in 2015, indicating that acid-soluble heavy metals migrated from tailings to topsoil. Acid-soluble Cd in topsoil and in the interlayer showed a small increase at plot SC, indicating that Cd may migrate through the clay layer to topsoil with pore water. The Pb contents in leaves at SLS and SL were 238 and 3.04 mg kg(-1), which were appreciably lower than at CT and SC, and the Zn and Cd contents in leaves at CT were 45.78 and 0.26 mg kg(-1), which were higher than at SLS, SL and SC. Topsoiling with an interlayer could be a reliable technique for preventing toxic elements from moving downward or upward during ecological restoration of tailings ponds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Leaf movements in Mimosa pudica, are in response to thermal stress, touch, and light or darkness, appear to be regulated by electrical, hydrodynamical, and chemical signal transduction. The pulvinus of the M. pudica shows elastic properties. We have found that the movements of the petiole, or pinnules, are accompanied by a change of the pulvinus morphing structures. After brief flaming of a pinna, the volume of the lower part of the pulvinus decreases and the volume of the upper part increases due to the redistribution of electrolytes between these parts of the pulvinus; as a result of these changes the petiole falls. During the relaxation of the petiole, the process goes in the opposite direction. Ion and water channel blockers, uncouplers as well as anesthetic agents diethyl ether or chloroform decrease the speed of alert wave propagation along the plant. Brief flaming of a pinna induces bidirectional propagation of electrical signal in pulvini. Transduction of electrical signals along a pulvinus induces generation of an action potential in perpendicular direction between extensor and flexor sides of a pulvinus. Inhibition of signal transduction and mechanical responses in M. pudica by volatile anesthetic agents chloroform or by blockers of voltage gated ion channels shows that the generation and propagation of electrical signals is a primary effect responsible for turgor change and propagation of an excitation. There is an electrical coupling in a pulvinus similar to the electrical synapse in the animal nerves. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	1.2
Accurate and high resolution bathymetric data is a necessity for a wide range of coastal oceanographic research topics. Active sensing methods, such as ship-based soundings and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), are expensive and time consuming solutions. Therefore, the significance of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has increased in the last ten years due to the availability of multi-constellation, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution remote sensing data as Open Data. Effective SDB algorithms have been proposed by many authors, but there is no ready-to-use software module available in the Geographical Information System (GIS) environment as yet. Hence, this study implements a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based SDB workflow as a Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS module (i.image.bathymetry). Several case studies were carried out to examine the performance of the module in multi-constellation and multi-resolution satellite imageries for different study areas. The results indicate a strong correlation between SDB and reference depth. For instance, case study 1 (Puerto Rico, Northeastern Caribbean Sea) has shown an coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 m, case study 2 (Iwate, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 1.50 m, and case study 3 (Miyagi, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.93 and an RMSE of 1.65 m. The reference depths were acquired by using LiDAR for case study 1 and an echo-sounder for case studies 2 and 3. Further, the estimated SDB has been used as one of the inputs for the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia (ANUGA) tsunami simulation model. The tsunami simulation results also show close agreement with post-tsunami survey data. The i.mage.bathymetry module developed as a part of this study is made available as an extension for the Open Source GRASS GIS to facilitate wide use and future improvements.	4.2
Water distribution systems (WDSs) construction, operation and disposal processes contribute to undesirable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. GHG concentration in the atmosphere is strongly associated with global warming and climate change. In order to meet the consequent challenge of limiting GHG emissions, the problem of WDS (re)design is formulated here as a multi-objective optimisation problem. The three objectives are as follows: (1) minimisation of total (re)design cost, (2) maximisation of the WDS resilience and, (3) minimisation of GHGs emissions. In addition to the frequently considered conventional (re)design intervention options (new pipes, pipe duplication or replacement, addition of pumps, tanks, etc.), various water demand management interventions (e.g. water efficient appliances and domestic Rainwater Harvesting Systems) are considered here too. A number of different rainwater tank sizes and water saving appliances provided to different parts of the households have been evaluated. This methodology was applied on the New York Tunnels and the Anytown network problems. The output from the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA2) optimisation process is a Pareto front containing optimal solutions traded-off in terms of the three objectives analysed. The results obtained demonstrate that using demand management technologies in the (re)design of WDSs can lead to a similar cost, resilience and GHG emissions but with cost savings. In a pumped WDS where cost savings and GHG emission reduction are relatively significant, demand management technologies led to more cost effective, resilient and climate change mitigating solutions as compared to the conventional (re)design.	4.3
Coast parallel submerged breakwaters made of Geotextile Sand Containers (GSCs) are increasingly being incorporated into coastal management solutions because of their cost effective and environmentally friendly characteristics. These reduce the wave action on the lee side by forcing wave breaking and their stability is a function of the relative crest width, crest height, and the damage. The present work involves a physical model study on 1V:2H sloped trapezoidal submerged reefs constructed with 485 gm GSCs with different alignments like Perpendicular, Parallel, and Flemish. They have a height (h) of 0.25 m and varying crest widths (B) and are tested for stability for wave heights (H) of 0.1 m and 0.12 m and wave periods (T) of 1.5 s to 2.5 s in a water depth (d) of 0.3 m.

Community opposition to locally unwanted development is not inherently problematic, but it can be destructive where conflict between proponents and objectors escalates. This paper relates mixed-methods findings from a Sydney case-study where opposition to planned affordable housing projects was widespread but uneven. Five factors are identified that escalated individual opposition campaigns in this case: public notification procedures; sense of injustice; prejudice; strong campaign leadership; and the involvement of politicians. We argue that these factors will likely also escalate opposition to the planned development of other forms of critical social infrastructure, and that an understanding of them can help minimise destructive conflicts between proponents and host communities.	2.0
Nanoparticles (NPs) possess unique physical and chemical properties that make them appropriate for various applications. The structural alteration of metallic NPs leads to different biological functions, specifically resulting in different potentials for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The amount of ROS produced by metallic NPs correlates with particle size, shape, surface area, and chemistry. ROS possess multiple functions in cellular biology, with ROS generation a key factor in metallic NP-induced toxicity, as well as modulation of cellular signaling involved in cell death, proliferation, and differentiation. In this review, we briefly explained NP classes and their biomedical applications and describe the sources and roles of ROS in NP-related biological functions in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we also described the roles of metal NP-induced ROS generation in stem cell biology. Although the roles of ROS in metallic NP-related biological functions requires further investigation, modulation and characterization of metallic NP-induced ROS production are promising in the application of metallic NPs in the areas of regenerative medicine and medical devices.	6.1
A new technique called geotextile mattress with floating curtain (GMFC) may be an advisable alternative countermeasure against seabed erosion, since it can allow deposited sediment dunes to form naturally at upstream and downstream sides of GMFC when installed in erosive flow. However, cyclic loading of wave actions can lead to liquefaction of the seabed under the mattress, reducing the maximum friction resistance of the mattress, even leading to instability of the GMFC structure. Thus, in this study a series of physical model tests in a rectangular flume were carried out to investigate the behavior of a single GMFC and the hydrodynamic environment around GMFC subjected to wave loading. The wave force on seabed was recorded by pressure gauges installed on the flume bed. Experimental results indicated that some area of the unmovable bed around GMFC suffered much higher hydrodynamic pressure under the wave action. The areas directly facing the bottom openings of GMFC are more prone to bear higher cyclic force of wave actions. Moreover, the results also illustrated that the highest cyclic force of wave actions on the seabed appears at a distance of the mattress-curtain height to the GMFC centerline. The parametric study indicated that the opening ratio has a significant impact on the wave force properties.	4.1
Purpose of Review The purposes of this study were to examine the relationships between obesity and a wide range of mental health issues and to identify where sex differences exist and may vary across disorders. Recent Findings Research on sex differences in the relationship between obesity and psychiatric disorders is more abundant in some areas, such as depression and eating disorders, than others, such as anxiety, trauma, and substance use. However, for most of the disorders, their relationships with obesity and sex are complex and are usually moderated by additional variables. Thus, studies that find stronger relationships for women between depression and obesity cross-sectionally do not tell the whole story, as longitudinal studies suggest that this relationship may also be present among men, particularly when confounders are considered. For those with eating disorders, men and women with obesity are fairly equally affected, and weight and shape concerns may play a role in maintaining these behaviors for both sexes. Weight stigma, though, seems to have worse consequences for women than men with obesity. Summary Sex differences exist in relation to the associations between mental health and obesity. However, these differences vary by disorder, with disorder-specific moderators playing a role, such as age for depressive disorders, comorbid depression for anxiety disorders, and weight and shape concerns for eating disorders. More work is needed to understand if sex differences play a role in the relationship between obesity and anxiety, trauma, and substance use disorders.	5.4
Drought is a natural climatic phenomenon that occurs throughout the world and impacts many sectors of society. To help decision-makers reduce the impacts of drought, it is important to improve monitoring tools that provide relevant and timely information in support of drought mitigation decisions. Given that drought is a complex natural hazard that manifests in different forms, monitoring can be improved by integrating various types of information (e.g., remote sensing and climate) that is timely and region specific to identify where and when droughts are occurring. The Vegetation Drought Response Index for Canada (VegDRI-Canada) is a recently developed drought monitoring tool for Canada. VegDRI-Canada extends the initial VegDRI concept developed for the conterminous United States to a broader transnational coverage across North America. VegDRI-Canada models are similar to those developed for the United States, integrating satellite observations of vegetation status, climate data, and biophysical information on land use and land cover, soil characteristics, and other environmental factors. Collectively, these different types of data are integrated into the hybrid VegDRI-Canada to isolate the effects of drought on vegetation. Twenty-three weekly VegDRI-Canada models were built for the growing season (April-September) through the weekly analysis of these data using a regression tree-based data mining approach. A 15-year time series of VegDRI-Canada results (s to 2014) was produced using these models and the output was validated by randomly selecting 20% of the historical data, as well as holdout year (15% unseen data) across the growing season that the Pearson's correlation ranged from 0.6 to 0.77. A case study was also conducted to evaluate the VegDRI-Canada results over the prairie region of Canada for two drought years and one non-drought year for three weekly periods of the growing season (i.e., early-, mid-, and late season). The comparison of the VegDRI-Canada map with the Canadian Drought Monitor (CDM), an independent drought indicator, showed that the VegDRI-Canada maps depicted key spatial drought severity patterns during the two targeted drought years consistent with the CDM. In addition, VegDRI-Canada was compared with canola yields in the Prairie Provinces at the regional scale for a period from 2000 to 2014 to evaluate the indices' applicability for monitoring drought impacts on crop production. The result showed that VegDRI-Canada values had a relatively higher correlation (i.e., r>0.5) with canola yield for nonirrigated croplands in the Canadian Prairies region in areas where drought is typically a limiting factor on crop growth, but showed a negative relationship in the southeastern Prairie region, where water availability is less of a limiting factor and in some cases a hindrance to crop growth when waterlogging occurs. These initial results demonstrate VegDRI-Canada's utility for monitoring drought-related vegetation conditions, particularly in drought prone areas. In general, the results indicated that the VegDRI-Canada models showed sensitivity to known agricultural drought events in Canada over the 15-year period mainly for nonirrigated areas.	4.2
We study wave propagation in a draining bathtub: a black hole analogue in fluid mechanics whose perturbations are governed by a Klein-Gordon equation on an effective Lorentzian geometry. Like the Kerr spacetime, the draining bathtub geometry possesses an (effective) horizon, an ergosphere and null circular orbits. We propose here that a 'pulse' disturbance may be used to map out the light-cone of the effective geometry. First, we apply the eikonal approximation to elucidate the link between wavefronts, null geodesic congruences and the Raychaudhuri equation. Next, we solve the wave equation numerically in the time domain using the method of lines. Starting with Gaussian initial data, we demonstrate that a pulse will propagate along a null congruence and thus trace out the light-cone of the effective geometry. Our new results reveal features, such as wavefront intersections, frame-dragging, winding and interference effects, that are closely associated with the presence of null circular orbits and the ergosphere.	3.4
Reading other people's eyes is a valuable skill during interpersonal interaction. Although a number of studies have investigated visual patterns in relation to the perceiver's interest, intentions, and goals, little is known about eye gaze when it comes to differentiating intentions to love from intentions to lust (sexual desire). To address this question, we conducted two experiments: one testing whether the visual pattern related to the perception of love differs from that related to lust and one testing whether the visual pattern related to the expression of love differs from that related to lust. Our results show that a person's eye gaze shifts as a function of his or her goal (love vs. lust) when looking at a visual stimulus. Such identification of distinct visual patterns for love and lust could have theoretical and clinical importance in couples therapy when these two phenomena are difficult to disentangle from one another on the basis of patients' self-reports.	2.2
Synaptic dysfunction and loss is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with increasing evidence implicating neuropathological tau protein in this process. Despite the knowledge that tau spreads through defined synaptic circuits, it is currently unknown whether synapse loss occurs before the accumulation of tau or as a consequence. To address this, we have used array tomography to examine an rTgTauEC mouse model expressing a P301L human tau transgene and a transgene labeling cytoplasm red (tdTomato) and presynaptic terminals green (Synaptophysin-EGFP). All transgenes are restricted primarily to the entorhinal cortex using the neuropsin promotor to drive tTA expression. It has previously been shown that rTgTauEC mice exhibit neuronal loss in the entorhinal cortex and synapse density loss in the middle molecular layer (MML) of the dentate gyrus at 24 months of age. Here, we observed the density of tau-expressing and total presynapses, and the spread of tau into the postsynapse in the MML of 3-6, 9, and 18 month old red-green-rTgTauEC mice. We observe no loss of synapse density in the MML up to 18 months even in axons expressing tau. Despite the maintenance of synapse density, we see spread of human tau from presynaptic terminals to postsynaptic compartments in the MML at very early ages, indicating that the spread of tau through neural circuits is not due to the degeneration of axon terminals and is an early feature of the disease process.	5.2
Vascular disease, such as atherosclerosis and diabetic vasculopathy, is frequently complicated by vascular calcification. Previously believed to be an end-stage process of unregulated mineral precipitation, it is now well established to be a multi-faceted disease influenced by the characteristics of its vascular location, the origins of calcifying cells and numerous regulatory pathways. It reflects the fundamental plasticity of the vasculature that is gradually being revealed by progress in vascular and stem cell biology. This review provides a brief overview of where we stand in our understanding of vascular calcification, facing the challenge of translating this knowledge into viable preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an important research paradigm since the last decade, thereby motivating researches to take up new theoretical and practical challenges. WSNs need to be provided with efficient security features generally due to their deployment in inaccessible terrain and also communication being in the wireless domain. Therefore the question of providing security to such networks arises but the major constraints are the limited resources present in the sensor nodes. Prior importance is given to the energy parameter as it is the most vital component of the sensor nodes. So the objective of any intrusion detection framework would be to design robust mechanisms capable of handling attacks in energy efficient manner. Intrusion detection is used in WSNs because of their ability to detect unknown attacks and finding means to thwart them for preserving energy. Therefore energy efficient intrusion detection has become a significant research area for researchers. Keeping this in mind, we survey the major topics of energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs. The survey work presents topics such as the fundamentals of intrusion detection techniques, as well as the various energy saving mechanisms used in different architectural models. The earlier achievements in energy efficient intrusion detection in WSNs are also summarized and existing problems are discussed. We also give an insight into the possible directions for future work in intrusion detection by highlighting open research areas.	4.0
Tests of physical vapour deposition (PVD) coatings performed in the past at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in real fluid film bearing environment revealed inconsistencies in coating behaviour. Currently, a new lot of bearings with an improved diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating was tested. The oil-off tests revealed an improved coating performance for the new bearing lot than for previously-examined cases. In order to check the consistency in coating performance, bearings from the new lot ran 100 cumulative hours without oil-supply. Coating analyses before and after the tests in real fluid film bearing environment were performed at NASA GRC. Investigations were additionally conducted by means of an innovative indentation technique and related Finite element method simulations on the coatings of 2 of the bearings, one already tested in real-environment conditions and the other one new, at the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Manufacturing Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.	3.2
Gender-specific differences are also evident for adverse food reactions. In the present article, the prevalence of food allergies and intolerances, the incidence of different symptoms, and the possible underlying factors are summarized with focus on gender and/or sex-specific differences. Eventually, it becomes clear that starting with the adolescence more female than male patients suffer from food-associated symptoms. Many factors are held responsible, among them hormonal influences, gender-specific behavior and life-style, processing of information, awareness of risk, or intake of different medications. Concrete studies evaluating these factors in context with adverse food reactions are still missing.	5.1
Enhanced inflammation has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diseases with Lewy body (LB) pathology, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). One issue is whether amyloid and tangle pathology, features of AD, or alpha-synuclein LB pathology have similar or different effects on brain inflammation. An aim of this study was to examine if certain features of inflammation changed in brains with increasing LB pathology. To assess this, we measured levels of the anti-inflammatory protein CD200 and the pro-inflammatory protein intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in cingulate and temporal cortex from a total of 143 cases classified according to the Unified Staging System for LB disorders. Changes in CD200 and ICAM-1 levels did not correlate with LB pathology, but with AD pathology. CD200 negatively correlated with density of neurofibrillary tangles, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid plaque density. ICAM-1 positively correlated with these AD pathology measures. Double immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein and markers for microglia showed limited association of microglia with LB pathology, but microglia strongly associated with amyloid plaques or phosphorylated tau. These results suggest that there are different features of inflammatory pathology in diseases associated with abnormal alpha-synuclein compared with AD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Previous research suggests racial identity and racial cues, such as the extent to which an event is blatantly or ambiguously race-related, individually shape African American (AA) individuals' experiences with racial discrimination (RD). However, scant attention has been paid to the interactive or transactional influences of these factors. The present study examined the direct effects of racial cues and the interactive effects of racial cues and racial identityspecifically, the extent to which AAs believe others view AAs negativelyon 78 AAs' interpretations of and affective responses to lab-based RD. Findings revealed a direct effect of racial cues on participants' perceptions of the event as being race-relevant and on participants' affect. Moreover, racial identity moderated the associations between racial cues and participants' perceptions and affective responses. These findings suggest that AAs' experiences with RD are not homogeneous and that the interplay or transaction between racial cues and racial identity is vital in such experiences.	2.0
The implementation of intraoral and extraoral computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems in prosthetic dentistry has simplified the procedure, shortened the period of design and manufacture and improved accuracy and aesthetic properties of dental restorations. Three-dimensional (3D) digitisation has become an adequate replacement for conventional dental impressions. The market offers a variety of diverse optical intraoral and extraoral CAD/CAM systems equipped with digitisation devices that are based on different working principles. The main goal of this research is to determine whether precision and accuracy differ among optical digitisation devices. The research includes five high-end devices: Cerec AC, Cerec InEos, Trios, KaVo Everest and Sinergia Scan. The evaluation methodology of the experiment is based on CAD inspection. The results, obtained from accuracy and precision measurements with tolerance levels of 0.01, 0.25 and 0.05 mm, indicate that there is a difference in accuracy and precision between optical digitisation devices based on different working principles.	3.0
PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to describe health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in persons with ostomies and to explore influencing factors. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Eight hundred twenty-seven persons living with an ostomy were enrolled from 5 provinces and cities in China from October 2010 to November 2012; the final sample comprises 729 individuals who completed data collection. Their mean +/- SD age was 62.59 +/- 12.40 years (range 26-93 years). METHODS: Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Chinese language version of the City of Hope-Quality of Life-Ostomy Questionnaire-Chinese Version. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, self-efficacy, adjustment to an ostomy, social support, and psychological state of patients were measured by a general information questionnaire. We also administered the Stoma Self-Efficacy Scale, Ostomy Adjustment Inventory-Chinese Version, the Social Support Revalued Scale, and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. RESULTS: Of the 729 ostomy patients, the overall HRQOL in ostomy patients was in the moderate range (mean score 5.19 +/- 1.29); scores of physical domain, psychological domain, social domain, and spiritual domains also in the moderate range (5.00 +/- 1.73, 5.97 +/- 1.59, 4.86 +/- 2.31, and 4.93 +/- 2.08 respectively). Multivariate analysis found that multiple factors influenced HRQOL in persons with an ostomy; they were gender, religious belief, and marital status, psychological factors depression and anxiety, and specific components related to social support, self-efficacy in ostomy care, and adjustment to an ostomy. CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of life among Chinese patients with fecal ostomies was less than optimal and influenced by multiple demographic and psychosocial factors. Additional research is needed to design strategies to improve HRQOL in this population.	5.4
Varroa destructor is the most devastating parasite of the Western honeybee, Apis mellifera. In the light of the arm race opposing the host and its parasite, the population dynamics and genetic diversity of these organisms are key parameters. However, the life cycle of V. destructor is characterized by extreme inbreeding due to full sibling mating in the host brood cells. We here present an equation reflecting the evolution of inbreeding in such a clonal system, and compare our predictions with empirical data based on the analysis of seven microsatellite markers. This comparison revealed that the mites perform essentially incestuous mating in the beginning of the brood season. However, this pattern changes with the development of mite infestation. Despite the fact that the overall level of genetic diversity of the mites remained low through the season, multiple inbred lineages were identified in the mites we sampled in June. As a response to the decrease of brood availability and the increase of the parasite population in parallel in the colonies, these lineages recombined towards the end of the season as mites co-infest brood cells. Our results suggest that the ratio of the number of mite per brood cell in the colony determines the genetic structure of the populations of V. destructor. This intracolonial population dynamics has great relevance for the selection of acaricide resistance in V. destructor. If chemical treatments occur before the recombination phase, inbreeding will greatly enhance the fixation of resistance alleles at the colony level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	6.4
An erythromycin (ERY) detection method is proposed using the fiber optic core decorated with the coatings of silver and an over layer of ERY imprinted nanoparticles. Synthesis of ERY imprinted nanoparticles is carried out using miniemulsion method. The operating range of the sensor is observed to be from 1.62x10(-3) to 100 mu M while the sensor possesses the linear response for ERY concentration range from 0.1 to 5 mu M. The sensing method shows a maximum sensitivity of 205 nm/M near ERY concentration of 0.01 mu M. The detection limit and the quantification limit of the sensor are found to be 1.62x10(-3) mu M and 6.14x10(-3) mu M, respectively. The sensor's applicability in real samples is also examined and is found to be in good agreement for the industrial application. The sensor possesses numerous advantages like fast response time (< 15 s), simple, low cost, highly selective along with abilities towards online monitoring and remote sensing of analyte.	4.2
The concomitant effects of hydraulics and reaction kinetics on the disinfection efficiency (DE) of Chlorine Contact Tank (CCT) setups were experimentally assessed, to test the predictive-ability of first order kinetics models: Chick-Watson (C-W), C-t rule and Wehner-Wilhelm (W-W). Prototype tests were conducted using river water characterised for quality parameters, chlorine demand and inactivation rates of total and thermotolerant coliform. Poor, average and superior CCT baffling conditions were assessed by tracer experimentation and for their DE under three chlorine dosages. The models' DE predictive-ability was comparable and high for superior baffling, but decreased differently with the hydraulic efficiency (maximum errors of +15.3% with W-W, +26.0% with C-W and -36.6% with C-t). The positive bias shown by W-W renders it unsafe for CCT design, so the results favoured the C-t rule as the preferred analytical tool of comparable complexity. Potential refinements to these models that could lead to operational savings are identified.	3.1
The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a well-known standard protocol, mainly used for remotely accessing shell accounts on Unix-like operating systems to perform administrative tasks. As a result, the SSH service has been an appealing target for attackers, aiming to guess root passwords performing dictionary attacks or to directly exploit the service itself. To identify such situations, this article addresses the detection of SSH anomalous connections from an intrusion detection perspective. The main idea is to compare several strategies and approaches for a better detection of SSH-based attacks. To test the classification performance of different classifiers and combinations of them, SSH data coming from a real-world honeynet are gathered and analysed. For comparison purposes and to draw conclusions about data collection, both packet-based and flow data are analysed. A wide range of classifiers and ensembles are applied to these data, as well as different validation schemes for better analysis of the obtained results. The high-rate classification results lead to positive conclusions about the identification of malicious SSH connections.	0.4
Previous work has shown that compared to passive perceivers who view preselected information about target persons, active perceivers are less confident in their impressions, do not show increased confidence with increased amounts of information, and like targets less. The authors now explain these findings, postulating that perceivers without control over the amount of information they receive should be motivated to form impressions earlier, altering their information-processing strategies. Study 1 predicted and found that content-only active perceivers who control the content, but not the amount, of information show the same positive relationship between confidence and amount of information as passive perceivers, as well as the same reading-time patterns and level of liking. Study 2 used clearly valenced target stimuli and found support for the hypothesis that passive perceivers form more extreme early impressions, leading to greater liking when early information is positive but less liking when it is negative.	2.2
On the basis of the operating cooling fluid, internal combustion engine cooling systems can be classified in two macro areas: air-cooling system and liquid-cooling system. In four-stroke engines, liquid-cooling system is generally preferred to the air-cooling system because of its efficiency in the engine heat dissipation. However, thanks to its simplicity, today the engine air-cooling system is still widely used in the engine market, especially on two-stroke engine applications like small motorbike, light aircraft, and handheld products. To assure the necessary heat waste in air-cooled engines, the key point is the optimization of the air flow over the cylinder external surface. Air flow separation from cylinder external surface can result in high temperature gradients inside the cylinder volume causing destructive heat problem for the engine. It can be avoided only by a fine optimization of the cylinder fin design placed externally to the cylinder surface. To fulfil this need, the definition of specific methodology to evaluate the air-cooling effect on the engine is mandatory. In the present paper, the authors present a 3D-CFD simulation methodology designed to perform a detailed evaluation of two-stroke air-cooled engines. The methodology was applied on two different engines equipping handheld brush-cutter machines. The optimization of the air-cooling system of such a machine is a very challenging task because the machine design must be very compact forcing all the engine parts to remain quite close each other. The simulation results are compared to experimental evidences in order to verify the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	3.3
Nonverbal processes are crucial to parent-child communication, but are seldom the focus of therapeutic intervention once a child is over 12 months of age. This paper reviews the literature on nonverbal communication in parent-child interaction. We outline assessment tools and interventions designed to measure and improve nonverbal communication, identify gaps in publications describing existing practice, and discuss implications for further intervention research and development. We searched Medline and PsycInfo databases for theoretical and empirical articles that defined, conceptualized, measured and intervened with parent-child nonverbal interaction. Although we found a number of validated and reliable assessment measures, these were not routinely used to inform development of interventions that directly targeted nonverbal communication. Additionally, we identified very few interventions that met established criteria for evidence-based practice, that directly focused on nonverbal communication as a target for change. Interventions that were included in this review utilized play, creative arts mediums and psycho-education to work therapeutically with nonverbal processes. Given the importance of nonverbal communication for effective parenting and parent-child communication, we recommend that nonverbal communication is assessed and addressed explicitly as a core part of parent-child intervention, development and evaluation. Intervention development may additionally be informed by existing nonverbal assessment tools, many of which already have established good reliability and validity, and therefore may assist with intervention as well as outcome measurement.	2.3
The accurately estimated state is of great importance for maintaining a stable running condition of power systems. To maintain the accuracy of the estimated state, bad data detection (BDD) is utilized by power systems to get rid of erroneous measurements due to meter failures or outside attacks. However, false data injection (FDI) attacks, as recently revealed, can circumvent BDD and insert any bias into the value of the estimated state. Continuous works on constructing and/or protecting power systems from such attacks have been done in recent years. This survey comprehensively overviews three major aspects: constructing FDI attacks; impacts of FDI attacks on electricity market; and defending against FDI attacks. Specifically, we first explore the problem of constructing FDI attacks, and further show their associated impacts on electricity market operations, from the adversary's point of view. Then, from the perspective of the system operator, we present countermeasures against FDI attacks. We also outline the future research directions and potential challenges based on the above overview, in the context of FDI attacks, impacts, and defense.	1.0
The canonical set of amino acids leads to an exceptionally wide range of protein functionality. Nevertheless, the set of residues still imposes limitations on potential protein applications. The incorporation of noncanonical amino acids can enlarge this scope. There are two complementary approaches for the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids. For site-specific incorporation, in addition to the endogenous canonical translational machineries, an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase-tRNA pair must be provided that does not interact with the canonical ones. Consequently, a codon that is not assigned to a canonical amino acid, usually a stop codon, is also required. This genetic code expansion enables the incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid at a single, given site within the protein. The here presented work describes residue-specific incorporation where the genetic code is reassigned within the endogenous translational system. The translation machinery accepts the noncanonical amino acid as a surrogate to incorporate it at canonically prescribed locations, i.e., all occurrences of a canonical amino acid in the protein are replaced by the noncanonical one. The incorporation of noncanonical amino acids can change the protein structure, causing considerably modified physical and chemical properties. Noncanonical amino acid analogs often act as cell growth inhibitors for expression hosts since they modify endogenous proteins, limiting in vivo protein production. In vivo incorporation of toxic noncanonical amino acids into proteins remains particularly challenging. Here, a cell-free approach for a complete replacement of L-arginine by the noncanonical amino acid L-canavanine is presented. It circumvents the inherent difficulties of in vivo expression. Additionally, a protocol to prepare target proteins for mass spectral analysis is included. It is shown that L-lysine can be replaced by L-hydroxy-lysine, albeit with lower efficiency. In principle, any noncanonical amino acid analog can be incorporated using the presented method as long as the endogenous in vitro translation system recognizes it.	6.0
Soil erosion is a serious environmental threat in the Mediterranean region due to torrential rainfalls, and it contributes to the degradation of agricultural land. Techniques such as rainwater harvesting may improve soil water storage and increase agricultural productivity, which could result in more effective land usage. Reservoir tillage is an effective system of harvesting rainwater, but it has not been scientifically evaluated like other tillage systems. Its suitability for the conditions in Spain has not been determined. To investigate and quantify water storage from reservoir tillage and how it could be adapted to improve infiltration of harvested rainwater, a laboratory-scale rainfall simulator was developed. Rainfall characteristics, including rainfall intensity, spatial uniformity and raindrop size, confirm that natural rainfall conditions are simulated with sufficient accuracy. The simulator was auto-controlled by a solenoid valve and three pressure nozzles were used to spray water corresponding to five rainfall intensities ranging from 36 to 112 mm h(-1) for 3 to 101-year return period with uniformity coefficients between 83 and 94%. In order to assess the reservoir tillage method under surface slopes of 0, 5, and 10%, three soil scooping devices with identical volume were used to make depressions in the following forms: a) truncated square pyramid, b) triangular prism, and c) truncated cone. These depressions were compared to a control soil surface with no depression. For the loam soil used in this study, results show that reservoir tillage was able to reduce soil erosion and surface runoff and significantly increase infiltration. There was significant difference between the depressions and the control. Compared to the control, depression (a) reduced surface runoff by about 61% and the sediment yield concentration by about 79%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.3
This research will assess the effectiveness of glass solar chimney wall by open frame (GSCW-O) and compare it with one-layer glass wall (OLGW) in Thailand. The results showed that the use of a GSCW-O can reduce the inside temperature compared with that of OLGW by around 2-4? annually, providing heat transfer to the outside, as well as limiting the relative humidity (RH) to 60%, which protects against the occurrence of fungi that cause allergies. The research also found that GSCW-O results in 10-20% less energy consumption when compared to OLGW. In addition being five times cheaper than insulation glass, the payback period for GSCW-O is only 5-6 years. The questionnaire results were satisfactory and proved GSCW-O is very good in practice, pleasing in design, and providing significant energy savings. Testing of hydroponic cultivation in a GSCW house also showed satisfactory growth with a lack of pests, resulting from controlled temperature, humidity, and protection from the elements. For a tropical climate such as Thailand's, GSCW-O is a suitable design for the reduction in energy consumption and for sustainable architecture. Practical application This research provides helpful information on glass solar chimney wall by open frame for both the owners and developers by adopting an energy efficient building for sustainable energy conservation. For tropical country like Thailand, glass solar chimney wall by open frame is a suitable design and the best alternative for saving energy and global environmental conservation in the building industry.	5.1
Arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages in older children. Intracerebral hematoma can cause serious lasting neurologic, cognitive, and language deficits, or even possible death. We present the case of a 16-year-old boy who had language impairments after suffering a large hemorrhagic stroke in the left temporoparietal region. All language components, verbal and nonverbal communication, reading, and writing, were found to be affected. These impairments were expected as they are characteristic of the location of the hematoma. After a year of speech language rehabilitation, there was an almost complete recovery of language skills. Quick diagnosis and adequate therapeutic interventions are important to diminish the influence of intracerebral hemorrhage on cognitive and language functions in children.	2.3
For a large class of functions to the group of points of an elliptic curve (typically obtained from certain algebraic correspondences between E and ), Farashahi et al. (Math Comput 82(281):491-512, 2013) established that the map is regular, in the sense that for a uniformly random choice of , the elliptic curve point is close to uniformly distributed in . This result has several applications in cryptography, mainly to the construction of elliptic curve-valued hash functions and to the Elligator Squared technique by Tibouchi (in: Christin and Safavi-Naini (eds) Financial cryptography. LNCS, vol 8437, pp 139-156. Springer, Heidelberg, 2014) for representating uniform points on elliptic curves as close to uniform bitstrings. In this paper, we improve upon Farashahi et al.'s character sum estimates in two ways: we show that regularity can also be obtained for a function of the form where g has a much smaller domain than , and we prove that the functions f considered by Farashahi et al. also satisfy requisite bounds when restricted to large intervals inside . These improved estimates can be used to obtain more efficient hash function constructions, as well as much shorter Elligator Squared bitstring representations.	0.3
Fittings called start connectors are usually employed to attach each lateral to its corresponding manifold in microirrigation systems. The protrusion of start connectors' barbs into the manifold induces pressure losses due to contraction and subsequent enlargement of streamlines. In addition, when water flows from a manifold toward a lateral through a start connector, a sudden contraction followed by expansions of flow streamlines cause pressure loss whose intensity is influenced by connector's geometry. Minor losses along manifolds or at laterals inlet due to start connectors may be significant and might be considered on subunits design or while undertaking hydraulic simulations. The objectives of this research were: (a) to develop equations based on dimensional analysis to estimate minor losses due to start connectors; (b) to compare the accuracy of the developed models against models that are currently used for estimating minor losses; (c) to undertake simulations to assess the relevance of minor losses due to start connectors in hydraulics of subunits. Minor losses due to start connectors were separated into two components. A model was developed and validated to estimate minor losses due to the protrusion of start connectors inserted along a manifold. Two models were developed and validated to estimate minor losses that occur when water flows from a manifold into a lateral line through a start connector. The required data to develop and validate the models were obtained experimentally in laboratory. Although minor losses due to start connectors represented a relative small percentage of total head losses, such effects may be significant while undertaking rigorous hydraulic simulations that require accurate estimation of pressure losses.	3.1
This paper introduces an optimization formulation to design residential water systems that satisfy the water demands in a housing complex involving rainwater harvesting, storage and distribution as well as the simultaneous design of water networks for recycling, reusing, regenerating and storing reclaimed water. The design task is considered as a multi-objective optimization problem where one objective is the minimization of the fresh water consumption and the other objective is the minimization of the total annual cost. The proposed model accounts for the variability in the water demands through the different hours of the day and for the different seasons of the year. The seasonal dependence of the rainwater has also been considered in the optimization model. A case study for the city of Morelia in Mexico is presented. The results show that significant reductions can be obtained in the total fresh water consumption and in the total cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.3
Otitis media (OM), or middle ear inflammation, is the most common paediatric disease and leads to significant morbidity. Although understanding of underlying disease mechanisms is hampered by complex pathophysiology it is clear that epithelial abnormalities underpin the disease. There is currently a lack of a well-characterised in vitro model of the middle ear (ME) epithelium that replicates the complex cellular composition of the middle ear. Here, we report the development of a novel in vitro model of mouse middle ear epithelial cells (mMECs) at an air-liquid interface (ALI) that recapitulates the characteristics of the native murine ME epithelium. We demonstrate that mMECs undergo differentiation into the varied cell populations seen within the native middle ear. Proteomic analysis confirmed that the cultures secrete a multitude of innate defence proteins from their apical surface. We showed that the mMECs supported the growth of the otopathogen, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), suggesting that the model can be successfully utilised to study host-pathogen interactions in the middle ear. Overall, our mMEC culture system can help to better understand the cell biology of the middle ear and improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of OM. The model also has the potential to serve as a platform for validation of treatments designed to reverse aspects of epithelial remodelling that underpin OM development.	6.1
This article presents a microfluidic approach for the integration of the process of aptamer selection via systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). The approach employs bead-based biochemical reactions in which affinity-selected target-binding oligonucleotides are electrokinetically transferred for amplification, while the amplification product is transferred back for affinity selection via pressure-driven fluid flow. The hybrid approach simplifies the device design and operation procedures by reduced pressure-driven flow control requirements and avoids the potentially deleterious exposure of targets to electric fields prior to and during affinity selection. In addition, bead-based reactions are used to achieve the on-chip coupling of affinity selection and amplification of target-binding oligonucleotides, thereby realizing on-chip loop closure and integration of the entire SELEX process without requiring offline procedures. The microfluidic approach is thus capable of closed-loop, multiround aptamer enrichment as demonstrated by selection of DNA aptamers against the protein immunoglobulin E with high affinity (K-D = 12 nM) in a rapid manner (4 rounds in approximately 10 h).	6.0
Background: Given the risk of opioid misuse among chronic pain patients being treated with longterm opioid pharmacotherapy, non-pharmacological treatments are needed. Further, in light of hedonic deficits in this population, therapies that enhance positive affect may be useful. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of a Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention on ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of pain and positive affective experience, and to determine if changes in pain, affect, and their interaction were associated with opioid misuse at post-treatment. Methods: This study examined unpublished EMA data from a subset of participants (N = 55) in a previously published RCT (NCT01505101) of MORE versus a support group (SG) control. Across 8 weeks of treatment, patients completed up to 224 EMA measures of pain and affect. Multilevel models and generalized estimating equations examined effects of treatment on momentary pain and positive affect, and generalized linear models examined associations between pain and affect and changes in opioid misuse by post-treatment. Results: Patients in MORE reported significantly greater improvements in momentary pain (p = 0.01) and positive affect (p = 0.004) than patients in the SG. Further, over the entire course of treatment, patients in MORE were significantly more likely to exhibit positive affect regulation (OR= 2.75) than patients in the SG. Finally, improvements in positive affect (but not pain) over the course of intervention were associated with reduced risk of misusing opioids by post-treatment (p= 0.02). Conclusion: MORE may be a useful non-pharmacological treatment for pain and hedonic deficits among chronic pain patients at risk for opioid misuse. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In recent years, advances in light-based technology have driven an ongoing optical revolution in neuroscience. Synergistic technologies in laser microscopy, molecular biology, organic and synthetic chemistry, genetic engineering and materials science have allowed light to overcome the limitations of and to replace many conventional tools used by physiologists to record from and to manipulate single cells or whole cellular networks. Here we review the different optical techniques for stimulating neurons, influencing neuronal growth, manipulating neuronal structures and neurosurgery.	6.0
In keeping with the special issue theme of Remembering the Future, this article provides a selective review of research on how memory for social information (i.e., social category representation) influences future processing and behavior. Specifically, the authors focus on how categorization and stereotyping affect how we perceive others and ourselves. The first part of the article reviews research on how individuals perceive others. The authors review research on the determinants and outcomes of social categorization and stereotype activation, concluding with the influence of ingroup/outgroup categorization on face processing. The second part of the article reviews research on how individuals perceive themselves. The authors argue that stereotype threat-concerns about being judged or behaving in ways that confirm negative group stereotypes, leading to poor performance-is the result of both self-categorization and stereotype activation. Overall, the article highlights the complex relationship between memory for social category information and future social perception and behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.2
Earlier studies have shown that the level of creativity of the fourth year students of the Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing Engineering Programmes at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia are low to average, as reflected in the evaluation of their group based design projects. Based on the finding for the next cohort of students, several creativity techniques are introduced in the course such as mind mapping and combined with the conventional techniques in design engineering which includes Morphology analysis and Pugh Evaluation matrix. Students are required to apply the techniques and report the implementation in their log books. It was observed that the students are more creative and able to propose ideas that are 'out of box thinking'. These achievements showed that the creativity level can be enhanced through teaching and learning. In order to ensure an effective infusion of creativity among students in the Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing Engineering Programmes, it is proposed that the students are exposed to effective creativity techniques combined with the standard engineering design methods for generating ideas. Students should be introduced to the creative techniques through design-based courses from their first year at the university. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is quite a challenge to remember or privately store the key for encrypting the secret image. Moreover, the encrypted image may arouse the invaders' suspicion. In this paper, a novel secret image sharing scheme with additional steganography and repairable capabilities is proposed using the bit-plane compression and Lagrange interpolation formula. The proposal suggests the user to select an ostensible image, for example, a famous character image, as the cover image to camouflage his secret image to enhance the security. Specifically, a protected image is divided into three shares and hidden in the cover image to create the meaningful shadow images. Then, three shadow images are distributed to three different devices, for example, the smartphone, the laptop, and the cloud storage. By collecting any two shadow images, the user can losslessly retrieve the original secret image and the cover image. In addition, the proposed scheme is easily repairable when the smartphone or laptop is lost. The system analysis shows that the proposal not only achieves theoretical information security, but also is technically practical.	0.3
Subunit vaccines for prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection based on glycoprotein B (gB) and pp65 are in clinical trials, but it is unclear whether simultaneous vaccination with both antigens enhances protection. We undertook evaluation of a novel bivalent vaccine based on nonreplicating lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) vectors expressing a cytoplasmic tail-deleted gB [gB(dCt)] and full-length pp65 from human CMV in mice. Immunization with the gB(dCt) vector alone elicited a comparable gB-binding antibody response and a superior neutralizing response to that elicited by adjuvanted subunit gB. Immunization with the pp65 vector alone elicited robust T cell responses. Comparable immunogenicity of the combined gB(dCt) and pp65 vectors with the individual monovalent formulations was demonstrated. To demonstrate proof of principle for a bivalent rLCMV-based HCMV vaccine, the congenital guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) infection model was used to compare rLCMV vectors encoding homologs of pp65 (GP83) and gB(dCt), alone and in combination versus Freund's adjuvanted recombinant gB. Both vectors elicited significant immune responses, and no loss of gB immunogenicity was noted with the bivalent formulation. Combined vaccination with rLCMV-vectored GPCMV gB(dCt) and pp65 (GP83) conferred better protection against maternal viremia than subunit or either monovalent rLCMV vaccine. The bivalent vaccine also was significantly more effective in reducing pup mortality than the monovalent vaccines. In summary, bivalent vaccines with rLCMV vectors expressing gB and pp65 elicited potent humoral and cellular responses and conferred protection in the GPCMV model. Further clinical trials of LCMV-vectored HCMV vaccines are warranted.	6.3
A liquid jet injector is a biomedical device intended for drug delivery. Medication is delivered through a fluid stream that penetrates the skin. This small diameter liquid stream is created by a piston forcing a fluid column through a nozzle. These devices can be powered by springs or compressed gas. In this study, a CFD simulation is carried out to investigate the fluid mechanics and performance of needle free injectors powered specifically by compressed air. The motion of the internal mechanisms of the injector which propels a liquid jet through an orifice is simulated by the moving boundary method and the fluid dynamics is modeled using LES/VOF techniques. In this paper, numerical results are discussed by comparing the fluid stagnation pressures of the liquid jet with previously published experimental measurements obtained using a custom-built prototype of the air-powered needle free liquid injector. Performance plots as a function of various injector parameters are presented and explained.	3.4
Urban habitats are described as having an overall negative influence on many fitness-related traits in several bird species, but a vital function such as immunity remains poorly studied. The immune response is strongly linked to individual condition, which partly depends on resource availability and the parasitic context that often differ between urban and natural habitats. A difference between the immunity of populations dwelling in urban areas and populations from more natural habitats can, therefore, be hypothesized. We conducted a 2-year experimental study on great tits (Parus major) in urban and forest areas. We stimulated the constitutive immunity of nestlings and assessed both the inflammatory response by measuring the plasma levels of haptoglobin, an inflammatory marker, and its activation cost through the loss of body mass. In addition, we checked the nestlings for ectoparasites and assessed haemosporidian prevalence in adults. Nestlings from urban sites produced relatively less haptoglobin and lost more body mass than those from forest sites, which suggests that the activation of constitutive immunity is more costly for birds living in urban sites than for those living in the forest. We detected no ectoparasite in birds in both habitats. However, urban adults showed lower haemosporidian prevalence than forest ones, suggesting a reduced exposure to these parasites and their vectors in towns. Overall, our study provides evidence for an immune difference between urban and forest populations. Because immunity is crucial for organism fitness, it is of prime interest to identify causes and processes at the origin of this difference.	6.3
Background: The fourth round of the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) Contest (www. casmi-contest. org) was held in 2016, with two new categories for automated methods. This article covers the 208 challenges in Categories 2 and 3, without and with metadata, from organization, participation, results and postcontest evaluation of CASMI 2016 through to perspectives for future contests and small molecule annotation/identification. Results: The Input Output Kernel Regression (CSI: IOKR) machine learning approach performed best in Category 2: Best Automatic Structural Identification-In Silico Fragmentation Only, won by Team Brouard with 41% challenge wins. The winner of Category 3: Best Automatic Structural Identification-Full Information was Team Kind (MSFINDER), with 76% challenge wins. The best methods were able to achieve over 30% Top 1 ranks in Category 2, with all methods ranking the correct candidate in the Top 10 in around 50% of challenges. This success rate rose to 70% Top 1 ranks in Category 3, with candidates in the Top 10 in over 80% of the challenges. The machine learning and chemistry-based approaches are shown to perform in complementary ways. Conclusions: The improvement in (semi-) automated fragmentation methods for small molecule identification has been substantial. The achieved high rates of correct candidates in the Top 1 and Top 10, despite large candidate numbers, open up great possibilities for high-throughput annotation of untargeted analysis for known unknowns. As more high quality training data becomes available, the improvements in machine learning methods will likely continue, but the alternative approaches still provide valuable complementary information. Improved integration of experimental context will also improve identification success further for real life annotations. The true unknown unknowns remain to be evaluated in future CASMI contests.	0.1
This article described a novel digital multi-mode control strategy for primary-side controlled flyback converter to improve the efficiency within full-load range. The working modes of different load ranges were chosen according to the main power losses analysis and other constraint. Especially, a novel pulse skip mode control method which could reduce the number of actual switching cycles was proposed to improve the light load efficiency. A prototype with field-programmable gate array control has been made to verify the proposed digital multi-mode control strategy.	1.4
This paper concerns the net effects of promoting renewable energies on value added and disposable income in Germany, as well as their distribution among regions and income brackets. Since its entry into force, the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) has stimulated tremendous investments in renewable energy capacities by guaranteeing investors a fixed price per kWh as well as a preferred feed into the grid over electricity from conventional sources. The policy measures are financed by a surcharge on electricity prices. In recent years, a controversy has arisen about potentially negative regional and social distribution effects. In this paper, multiregional price and quantity input-output models with endogenous heterogeneous households are used to trace the indirect impacts of the EEG on value added and disposable income through the complex network of regional value chains. Our findings suggest that the generation of electricity from renewable sources itself leads to small positive impacts on industries, but leads to a significant drain on household income and'has regressive distributive effects. However, investment in new capacities may possibly transform these negative impacts into a positive direction for the majority of households. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1.0
IntroductionThis study examined the relationships between changes in symptoms and changes in quality of life (QOL) during cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder (PD). MethodsWe treated 198 PD patients with group CBT in Japan. Using multiple regression analysis, we examined the associations between changes in QOL and changes in PD symptoms or comorbid psychological symptoms during CBT. ResultsChanges in anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic fear/avoidance, and somatization were significant predictors of changes in some aspects of QOL. DiscussionIt might be useful to decrease somatization, anticipatory anxiety, and agoraphobic fear to improve QOL in CBT for PD.	5.4
The following review presents a synthesis of 181 journal articles published during 2015 that represent progress toward better characterizing, controlling, and treating urban stormwater runoff. The review is structured by general topical areas related to (1) stormwater quality and quantity characterization; (2) engineered stormwater control and treatment practices, including erosion and sediment control, stormwater ponds, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention, permeable pavement, greenroofs, and rainwater harvesting systems; and (3) watershed-scale modeling and optimization of stormwater control and treatment practices. Common research themes emerging from this collection of studies include potential to enhance hydrologic and pollutant treatment performance of stormwater practices via media amendments and the use of innovative outlet control structures, as well as development of a more mechanistic understanding of hydrologic and water-quality functions to inform modeling and performance predictions. These studies serve to expand the field's knowledge base and will inform future efforts to further improve stormwater control and treatment at various spatial and temporal scales.	4.3
We conducted three experiments to determine if engaging in self-enhancing humor can alleviate state anxiety associated with an anticipated stressful event. In all three experiments, participants imagined they were about to take a stressful math test. In Experiment 1 participants who engaged in self-enhancing humor while anticipating taking the test experienced less state anxiety than those who engaged in self-defeating humor or no humor at all. Experiment 2 demonstrated that engaging in self-enhancing humor reduced state anxiety more than mere instructions to adopt a non-serious, humorous outlook in the stressful situation. Experiment 3 revealed that self-enhancing humor alone induced participants to adopt a humorous perspective on the stressful math test, but that participants responded with the least state anxiety when they were also given instructions about how to use the humor to reframe the math test. Collectively, our findings corroborate and extend previous correlational studies showing that self-enhancing humor can alleviate state anxiety associated with a stressful event.	5.4
From the moment of birth, each human being builds a microbe-host symbiosis which is key for the preservation of its health and well-being. This personal symbiotic coexistence is the result of progressive enrichments in microorganism diversity through external supplies. This diversity is nowadays massively overthrown by drastic changes related to clinical practice in birth management, environmental exposure, nutrition and healthcare behaviors. The last two generations have been the frame of massive modifications in life and food habits, with people being more and more sedentary, overfed and permeated with drugs and pollutants. We are now able to measure the impact of these changes on the gut microbiota diversity. Concomitantly, these modifications of lifestyle were associated with a dramatic increase in incidence of immune-mediated diseases including metabolic, allergic and inflammatory diseases and most likely neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Microbiota is becoming a hot topic in the scientific community and in the mainstream media. The number of scientific publications increased by up to a factor three over the last five years, with gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases being the most productive areas. In the intellectual property landscape, the patent families on microbiota have more than doubled in the meantime. In parallel, funding either from National Institutes (e.g. from NIH which funds research mainly in the field of allergies, infections, cancer and cardiovascular diseases, from the White House which launched the national microbiome initiative) or by pharmaceutical companies follow the same trend, showing a boost and a strong support in the research field on microbiota. All major health players are investing in microbiome research as shown by the number of deals signed and by funding during 2015. The Glens round table addressed how. the medicine of tomorrow, considering human beings as a human-microbe symbiotic supraorganism, could leverage microbiome knowledge and tools. The rationale for our working group has been structured around four domains of innovation that could derive from ongoing efforts in deciphering the interactions between human cells and intestinal microbiome as a central component of human health, namely: (1) development of stratification and monitoring tools; (2) identification of new target and drug discovery, as a part of our supra-genome; (4) exploitation of microbiota as a therapeutic target that can be modulated; (4) and finally as a source of live biotherapeutics and adjuvants. These four streams will exemplify how microbiota has changed the way we consider a wide range of chronic and incurable diseases and the consequences of long-lasting dysbiosis. In-depth micro biota analysis is opening one of the broadest fields of investigation for improving human and animal health and will be a source of major therapeutic innovations for tackling today's medical unmet needs. We thus propose a range of recommendations for basic researchers, care givers as welt as for health authorities to gain reliability in microbiome analysis and accelerate discovery processes and their translation into applications for the benefits of the people. Finally, les Ateliers de Glens round table on microbiota benefited from the richness of the French ecosystem. France represents a center of excellence in the microbiota research field, with French institutions as Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA [Metagenopolis, Micalis]), Centre national de ta recherche scientifique (CNRS), Unite de recherche sur les maladies infectieuses et tropicales emergentes (URMITE), Institut of Cardiometabolism and Nutrition (ICAN), Institut des maladies metaboliques et cardiovasculaires (I2MC). Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicate (Inserm), Pasteur Institute and Gustave-Roussy being top-players for the number of publications.

Preventing voltage waveform distortion in multifrequency current control during saturated operation is a difficult problem, which so far has been only partially solved. In this paper, a scheme based on the principle of realizable references is proposed. As the converter enters saturated operation, an algorithm recalculates the converter-current reference such that unsaturated operation returns, i.e., the converter-voltage reference does not exceed the space-vector-modulation hexagon. Distortion is thereby avoided, as is integrator windup.	1.4
Robots are capable of navigating and performing tasks in a wide range of environments. Yet, there is no systematic research on the relationship between robot and environments. In this paper, the intention is to place in context the importance of co-consideration of environments and robots for creating an intelligent living environment. As such, we develop a framework linking both robots and environments. The framework consists of (1) the robot-inclusiveness which measures how inclusive the environment for the robot is, (2) a taxonomy which classifies robot-environment interaction into five categories, (3) five design criteria and guidelines which support the design and evaluation of autonomous robotic systems in indoor and outdoor environments.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most important staple foods for more than half of the global population. Many rice traits are quantitative, complex and controlled by multiple interacting genes. Thus, a full understanding of genetic relationships will be critical to systematically identify genes controlling agronomic traits. We developed a genome-wide rice protein-protein interaction network (RicePPINet, ) using machine learning with structural relationship and functional information. RicePPINet contained 708819 predicted interactions for 16895 non-transposable element related proteins. The power of the network for discovering novel protein interactions was demonstrated through comparison with other publicly available protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction methods, and by experimentally determined PPI data sets. Furthermore, global analysis of domain-mediated interactions revealed RicePPINet accurately reflects PPIs at the domain level. Our studies showed the efficiency of the RicePPINet-based method in prioritizing candidate genes involved in complex agronomic traits, such as disease resistance and drought tolerance, was approximately 2-11 times better than random prediction. RicePPINet provides an expanded landscape of computational interactome for the genetic dissection of agronomically important traits in rice. Significance Statement A genome-wide rice protein-protein interaction network is developed by using machine-learning with structural evidence and functional information. It provides an expanded landscape of protein interactome to help plant biologists better understand complex agronomic traits in rice.	0.1
Associations between social class and prosocial behaviordefined broadly as action intended to help othersmay vary as a function of contextual factors. Three studies examined how making prosocial actions public, versus private, moderates this association. In Study 1, participation in a public prosocial campaign was higher among upper than lower class individuals. In Studies 2 and 3, lower class individuals were more prosocial in a dictator game scenario in private than in public, whereas upper class individuals showed the reverse pattern. Follow-up analyses revealed the importance of reputational concerns for shaping class differences in prosociality: Specifically, higher class individuals reported that pride motivated their prosocial behavior more than lower class individuals, and this association partially accounted for class-based differences in prosociality in public versus private contexts. Together, these results suggest that unique strategies for connecting and relating to others develop based on one's position in the class hierarchy.	2.4
Understanding emotional human behavior in its multimodal and continuous aspect is necessary for studying human machine interaction and creating constituent social agents. As a first step, we propose a system for continuous emotional behavior recognition expressed by people during communication based on their gesture and their whole body dynamical motion. The features used to classify the motion are inspired by the Laban Movement Analysis entities [11] and are mapped onto the well-known Russell Circumplex Model [4]. We choose a specific case study that corresponds to an ideal case of multimodal behavior that emphasizes the body motion expression: theater performance. Using a trained neural network and annotated data, our system is able to describe the motion behavior as trajectories on the Russell Circumplex Model diagram during theater performances over time. This work contributes to the understanding of human behavior and expression and is a first step through a complete continuous emotion recognition system whose next step will be adding facial expressions.

Introduction: Peer teaching is a well-established teaching method in medical education. During the 2012/13 winter term, the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology in Ulm, Germany, introduced a longitudinal didactics program (Train the Tutor: TtT) to train student tutors as near-peer teachers (NPT) in the dissection course (DC). Twenty-three of 38 tutors participated in the programme. Our study describes the educational concept and the NPTs' activities in the dissection course. Methods: NPTs documented their activities on a daily basis in the form of semi-structured reports. A total of 575 reports were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed. Free-text analysis was performed using Grounded Theory followed by code quantification of all indications (n - 1868). Results: NPTs spend 61% of their time dissecting by themselves or supervising the tutee's dissection process. Organisational tasks had a larger share at the beginning of the course. Just before examinations the proportion of time spent giving feedback rose. Of all positive indications, 45% described experiences working with the tutees. In contrast, 68% of all negative indications were characterized by a self-critical reflection on their own activities. NPTs included all learning domains in their teaching, substantially functioning as teachers and role models to convey particular attitudes. Conclusion: TtT-Trained Tutors (NPT) clearly met the requirements of a practical course and adjusted their activities in response to the course's progress. NPTs were concerned about their tutees' attitudes and may need more professional support within the TtT program regarding this. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	6.1
Over the last 30 years leading thinkers have taken us beyond mechanistic and reductionist analysis into systems theory and the critical boundary judgements that are fundamental to systems analysis. In defining and discussing boundary conditions, we also redefine values and facts imposed on hydrological and economic analysis that underpins decisions about government policy in water resources. The repeal of legislation for distributed interventions (water-efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting) that was previously enacted to improve the security of a regional water supply system is examined as a case study. The results of the analysis were defined by the costs and benefits that are inside or outside of the boundaries of legitimate and recognized consideration. This paper refers to those differences as boundary conditions and considers how those boundary conditions affect the outcome of analysis. Setting of boundary conditions (what is included, what is excluded and assumptions) in engineering and economic analysis dominates outcomes of decisions about government policy. These insights have general application to development of government water policy. The investigations outlined in this paper were combined to create an enhanced version of a systems analysis of a policy for setting targets for water savings on all new dwellings. It was established, using appropriate boundary conditions, that a 40% target for water savings is feasible for South East Queensland (SEQ) and provides a cost-benefit ratio of 2.1. These results indicate that a policy of mandating targets for sustainable buildings would provide substantial benefits to the state of Queensland, water utilities and citizens.	4.3
Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) seropositivity may be associated with decreased memory in older adults. To further investigate the association between T. gondii seropositivity and memory in nondemented older adults, we obtained serum samples from 114 nondemented older adults evaluated by the Alzheimer's Disease and Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. We determined T. gondii seropositivity and anti-T. gondii IgG antibody titer and examined associations with memory function while controlling for socioeconomic status, education level, age, and apolipoprotein E4 status. There were few associations between T. gondii seropositivity or anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies and memory, although there was some support suggesting an interaction between anti-T. gondii and sex. In the seropositive-only sample, there was an inverse relationship between anti-T. gondii titer and performance on the selective reminding test. Overall, we found little evidence of an association between impaired memory function and T. gondii seropositivity and anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in this sample of nondemented older adults.

Two years study was conducted to evaluate if leaf removal and red geotextile reflective mulch affect phenolic composition of wines from three red wine grape cultivars, Merlot, Teran and Plavac mali (Vitis vinifera L). Leaf removal (LR) and reflective mulch (RM), made from weave of aluminum platelets protected by a transparent film and sewn together with red polypropylene threads, were tested separately and combined (LR + RM) on vines of Merlot, Teran and Plavac mali in 2009 and 2010 years, and compared with untreated control. All treatments were applied at veraison. LR had the strongest influence on phenolic composition of experimental wines, particularly in terms of increasing gallic acid, catechin, malvidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside content. LR+RM resulted in higher gallic acid and malvidin-3-glucoside concentrations. RM treatment had the least effect on phenolic composition of wines but still affected higher epicatechin and gallic acid content. The total phenols, anthocyanins and flavan-3-ols contents in wines exhibited strong correlation with antioxidant activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.1
This paper presents the A-Diakoptics methodology (Diakoptics based on actors) for the high performance simulation of microgrids. Microgrids are clusters of loads and microsources that operate within a single controllable system, which provides electricity and heat to its local area even if they get separated from the distribution system. Several commercial solutions are addressing this topic using numerous methods; however, to keep the computing time required to solve the system when the size of the system grows represents a major challenge. In this paper, this challenge is addressed by separating the distribution grid in independent subnetworks. Then, for the computational implementation, each subnetwork is assigned to an independent solver using the actor model. As a result, the solution algorithm is composed of multiple parallel and concurrent solvers. These exchange information using high-speed communication interfaces for reducing the computational burden without losing accuracy. A-Diakoptics is an advanced algorithm that combines existing methods for simulating large distribution systems; these methods are upgraded to make them suitable for parallel processing and to cover the basic needs for the simulation of smart grid applications.	1.0
(We develop a generalised unsteady plume theory and compare it with a new direct numerical simulation (DNS) dataset for an ensemble of statistically unsteady turbulent plumes. The theoretical framework described in this paper generalises previous models and exposes several fundamental aspects of the physics of unsteady plumes. The framework allows one to understand how the structure of the governing integral equations depends on the assumptions one makes about the radial dependence of the longitudinal velocity, turbulence and pressure. Consequently, the ill-posed models identified by Scase & Hewitt (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 697, 2012, pp. 455-480) are shown to be the result of a non-physical assumption regarding the velocity profile. The framework reveals that these ill-posed unsteady plume models are degenerate cases amongst a comparatively large set of well-posed models that can be derived from the generalised unsteady plume equations that we obtain. Drawing on the results of DNS of a plume subjected to an instantaneous step change in its source buoyancy flux, we use the framework in a diagnostic capacity to investigate the properties of the resulting travelling wave. In general, the governing integral equations are hyperbolic, becoming parabolic in the limiting case of a 'top-hat' model, and the travelling wave can be classified as lazy, pure or forced according to the particular assumptions that are invoked to close the integral equations. Guided by observations from the DNS data, we use the framework in a prognostic capacity to develop a relatively simple, accurate and well-posed model of unsteady plumes that is based on the assumption of a Gaussian velocity profile. An analytical solution is presented for a pure straight-sided plume that is consistent with the key features observed from the DNS.	3.4
Features extracted from real world applications increase dramatically, while machine learning methods decrease their performance given the previous scenario, and feature reduction is required. Particularly, for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, the number of extracted features are sizable in order to collect all the available information from several monitored signals. Several approaches lead to data reduction using supervised or unsupervised strategies, where the supervised ones are the most reliable and its main disadvantage is the beforehand knowledge of the fault condition. This work proposes a new unsupervised algorithm for feature selection based on attribute clustering and rough set theory. Rough set theory is used to compute similarities between features through the relative dependency. The clustering approach combines classification based on distance with clustering based on prototype to group similar features, without requiring the number of clusters as an input. Additionally, the algorithm has an evolving property that allows the dynamic adjustment of the cluster structure during the clustering process, even when a new set of attributes feeds the algorithm, That gives to the algorithm an incremental learning property, avoiding a retraining process. These properties define the main contribution and significance of the proposed algorithm. Two fault diagnosis problems of fault severity classification in gears and bearings are studied to test the algorithm. Classification results show that the proposed algorithm is able to select adequate features as accurate as other feature selection and reduction approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose: To evaluate corneal parameters of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) by Scheimpflug imaging and also to clarify the associations between disease severity and clinical status of AS and corneal parameters. Methods: Fifty-seven patients with AS and 57 healthy subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. All participants underwent a detailed ophthalmological evaluation. Corneal parameters were measured by Pentacam. In addition, Schirmer test, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining, and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores were evaluated. Duration of disease and scores of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life scale (ASQoL) of the patients were recorded. The laboratory evaluation consisted of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: Corneal parameters were significantly different between patients with AS and healthy controls. The mean central corneal thickness (538 +/- 26 mu m versus 569 +/- 27 mu m, p < 0.001) and the mean corneal volume (59.8 +/- 3.33 mm(3) versus 62.3 +/- 3.40 mm(3), p<0.001) were reduced significantly in AS patients compared to those in healthy controls. The values of TBUT and Schirmer test scores were significantly lower in AS patients than in controls. Also, corneal fluorescein staining and OSDI scores were higher in AS patients than in controls. Factors related to the corneal parameters were dry eye tests (TBUT, Schirmer test, corneal fluorescein staining), OSDI score, and CRP (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusion: The AS patients have thinner corneas compared to control subjects, which may be affected by tear disfunction and inflammatory processes.	5.3
Many people view religion as a crucial source of morality. However, 6 experiments (total N = 1,078) revealed that good deeds are perceived as less moral if they are performed for religious reasons. Religiously motivated acts were seen as less moral than the exact same acts performed for other reasons (Experiments 1-2 and 6). Religious motivations also reduced attributions of intention and responsibility (Experiments 3-6), an effect that fully mediated the effect of religious motivations on perceived morality (Experiment 6). The effects were not explained by different perceptions of motivation orientation (i. e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic) across conditions (Experiment 4) and also were evident when religious upbringing led to an intuitive moral response (Experiment 5). Effects generalized across religious and nonreligious participants. When viewing a religiously motivated good deed, people infer that actually helping others is, in part, a side effect of other motivations rather than an end in itself. Thus, religiously motivated actors are seen as less responsible than secular actors for their good deeds, and their helping behavior is viewed as less moral than identical good deeds performed for either unclear or secular motivations.	2.2
In recent years, high speed direct drive spindle motors are obtaining more and more attentions due to their compact structure, high efficiency, low vibration and noise. Compared with those of high speed machines used for electric vehicles (EV) and refrigerator compressors, the shaft of a spindle motor is always thicker to satisfy the mechanical support requirement. When the overall outer diameter of a spindle motor is further limited for practical use, the rotor space will be restricted on both the inner and outer side, which makes the machine design process a more challenging work. This paper presents a detailed design procedure of a high speed interior PM spindle permanent magnet (PM) motor. With large volume consumption for the shaft, the rotor space is fully utilized by adopting the inverted interior V shaped PM rotor structure. Firstly, the split ratio is optimized for maximum torque density. Then, the rotor parameters, including the magnet thickness, PM pole arc, angle between adjacent PMs and the bridge width are optimized by finite element analysis (FEA). The simulated results show significant improvement on output performance, i.e. the torque density is increased by 22%. Finally, the analysis results are verified by experimental tests on a 11 Nm, 12000RPM prototype machine.	3.3
Background: Birth weight, a marker of the intrauterine environment, has been extensively studied in epidemiological research in relation to subsequent health and disease. Although numerous meta-analyses have been published examining the association between birth weight and subsequent health-related outcomes, the epidemiological credibility of these associations has not been thoroughly assessed. The objective of this study is to map the diverse health outcomes associated with birth weight and evaluate the credibility and presence of biases in the reported associations. Methods: An umbrella review was performed to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies investigating the association between birth weight and subsequent health outcomes and traits. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size by random-effects and fixed-effects models, the 95 % confidence interval, and the 95 % prediction interval. We also assessed the between-study heterogeneity, evidence for small study effects and excess significance bias. We further applied standardized methodological criteria to evaluate the epidemiological credibility of the statistically significant associations. Results: Thirty-nine articles including 78 associations between birth weight and diverse outcomes met the eligibility criteria. A wide range of health outcomes has been studied, ranging from anthropometry and metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors, various cancers, respiratory diseases and allergies, musculoskeletal traits and perinatal outcomes. Forty-seven of 78 associations presented a nominally significant summary effect and 21 associations remained statistically significant at P < 1 x 10(-6). Thirty associations presented large or very large between study heterogeneity. Evidence for small-study effects and excess significance bias was present in 13 and 16 associations, respectively. One association with low birth weight (increased risk for all-cause mortality), two dose-response associations with birth weight (higher bone mineral concentration in hip and lower risk for mortality from cardiovascular diseases per 1 kg increase in birth weight) and one association with small-for-gestational age infants with normal birth weight (increased risk for childhood stunting) presented convincing evidence. Eleven additional associations had highly suggestive evidence. Conclusions: The range of outcomes convincingly associated with birth weight might be narrower than originally described under the fetal origin hypothesis of disease. There is weak evidence that birth weight constitutes an effective public health intervention marker.	5.1
Objectives: This study investigates how racial identity and phenotypicality (i.e., racial ambiguity) shape the perception of biracial individuals in both White and Black perceivers. We investigated complex racial categorization and its downstream consequences, such as perceptions of discrimination. Method: We manipulated racial phenotypicality (Black or racially ambiguous) and racial identity (Black or biracial) to test these cues' influence on Black and White race categorizations in a sample of both White (n = 145) and Black (n = 152) identified individuals. Results: Though racial identity and phenotypicality information influenced deliberate racial categorization, White and Black participants used the cues in different ways. For White perceivers, racial identity and phenotypicality additively influenced Black categorization. For Black perceivers, however, racial identity was only used in Black categorization when racial ambiguity was high. Perceived discrimination was related to White (but not Black) perceivers' distribution of minority resources to targets, however Black categorization related to perceived discrimination for Black perceivers only. Conclusion: By demonstrating how Black and White individuals use identity and phenotype information in race perceptions, we provide a more complete view of the complexities of racial categorization and its downstream consequences.	2.2
Caffeine is the most widely used psychostimulant in Western countries, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), caffeine is beneficial in both men and women, in humans and animals. Similar effects of caffeine were observed in men with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the effect of caffeine in female PD patients is controversial due to caffeine's competition with estrogen for the estrogen-metabolizing enzyme, CYP1A2. Studies conducted in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showed protective effects of A(2A)R antagonism. A study found caffeine to be associated with earlier age of onset of Huntington's disease (HD) at intakes >190mg/d, but studies in animal models have found equivocal results. Caffeine is protective in AD and PD at dosages equivalent to 3-5mg/kg. However, further research is needed to investigate the effects of caffeine on PD in women. As well, the effects of caffeine in ALS, HD and Machado-Joseph disease need to be further investigated. Caffeine's most salient mechanisms of action relevant to neurodegenerative diseases need to be further explored.	5.2
Cocaine addiction is characterized by alterations in motivational and cognitive processes. Recent studies have shown that some alterations present in cocaine users may be related to the activity of large functional networks. The aim of this study was to investigate how these functional networks are modulated by non-drug rewarding stimuli in cocaine-dependent individuals. Twenty abstinent cocaine-dependent and 21 healthy matched male controls viewed erotic and neutral pictures while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Group independent component analysis was then performed in order to investigate how functional networks were modulated by reward in cocaine addicts. The results showed that cocaine addicts, compared with healthy controls, displayed diminished modulation of the left frontoparietal network in response to erotic pictures, specifically when they were unpredicted. Additionally, a positive correlation between the length of cocaine abstinence and the modulation of the left frontoparietal network by unpredicted erotic images was found. In agreement with current addiction models, our results suggest that cocaine addiction contributes to reduce sensitivity to rewarding stimuli and that abstinence may mitigate this effect.	5.0
In this paper, hydraulic performance and self-healing capacity of geotextile clay liners containing various amounts of nano-clay are studied. Nano-clay was employed as a substitute of a portion of bentonite. For comparison, the hydraulic performance and self-healing capacity of common geotextile clay liners (geotextile clay liners without any additives) were also experimentally studied. A novel instrument was developed to evaluate the self-healing capacity of geotextile clay liners samples. Atterberg limits and free swell index of neat and modified clayey samples were also measured. Experimental results showed that nano-clay considerably reduces the hydraulic conductivity of geotextile clay liners. It also improves the self-healing capacity of geotextile clay liners. The free swell index and liquid limits of bentonite specimens containing nano-clay were considerably higher than that of normal specimens. It can be concluded that factors affecting the free swell index of bentonite can change the self-healing capacity of geotextile clay liners. In this study, the specimen containing 15% nano-clay showed the best performance in hydraulic conductivity and self-healing capacity among all specimens. In the final, the effect of nano-clay inclusion on the permeability of bentonite is showed through an analytical model using the results of surface tension measurements.	4.1
Background: Previous studies have suggested that fear memories can be updated when recalled, a process referred to as reconsolidation. Given the beneficial effects of model-based safety learning (i.e. vicarious extinction) in preventing the recovery of short-term fear memory, we examined whether consolidated long-term fear memories could be updated with safety learning accomplished through vicarious extinction learning initiated within the reconsolidation time-window. We assessed this in a final sample of 19 participants that underwent a three-day within-subject fear-conditioning design, using fear-potentiated startle as our primary index of fear learning. Methods: On day 1, two fear-relevant stimuli (reinforced CSs) were paired with shock (US) and a third stimulus served as a control (CS). On day 2, one of the two previously reinforced stimuli (the reminded CS) was presented once in order to reactivate the fear memory 10 min before vicarious extinction training was initiated for all CSs. The recovery of the fear memory was tested 24 h later. Results and conclusion: Vicarious extinction training conducted within the reconsolidation time window specifically prevented the recovery of the reactivated fear memory (p = 0.03), while leaving fear potentiated startle responses to the non-reactivated cue intact (p = 0.62). These findings are relevant to both basic and clinical research, suggesting that a safe, non-invasive model-based exposure technique has the potential to enhance the efficiency and durability of anxiolytic therapies.

Recent research suggests that prosocial outcomes in sharing games arise from prefrontal control of self-maximizing impulses. We used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt the functioning of two prefrontal areas, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). We used cTBS in the right MT/V5, as a control area. We then tested subjects' prosocial inclinations with an unsupervised Dictator Game in which they allocated real money anonymously between themselves and low and high socioeconomic status (SES) players. cTBS over the two prefrontal sites made subjects more generous compared to MT/V5. More specifically, cTBS over DLPFC increased offers to high-SES players, while cTBS over DMPFC caused increased offers to low-SES players. These data, the first to demonstrate an effect of disruptive neuromodulation on costly sharing, suggest that DLPFC and MPFC exert inhibitory control over prosocial inclinations during costly sharing, though they may do so in different ways. DLPFC may implement contextual control, while DMPFC may implement a tonic form of control. This study demonstrates that humans' prepotent inclination is toward prosocial outcomes when cognitive control is reduced, even when prosocial decisions carry no strategic benefit and concerns for reputation are minimized.	2.1
Aim. We tested the performance of the tissue homogenizer Bead Beater MillMix 20 (Tehtnica - Domel) for grinding the bone samples from skeletal remains for sub sequential extraction and DNA typing of human identification Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). Methods. We analyzed 60 bone DNA extracts obtained from femurs and tibias. From 13 bones (6 femurs and 7 tibias) analyses were repeated two and from 4 femurs three times to evaluate the repeatability of the extraction method and grinding machine used. DNA was obtained from 0.5 g of demineralizated bone powder and the samples were quantified using the Human Quantifiler or the Investigator Quantiplex kit. STR typing was performed using the NGM or the Investigator ESSplex Plus kit to evaluate the quality of bone powder and tested extraction method. Results. Of the profiles obtained from 60 DNA extracts, 73% were full, 17% acceptable, 8% quite acceptable and only 2% of the profiles were not suitable for interpretation which represent a 98% success rate. From 17 bones analyses were repeated two or three times and results obtained show high degree of repeatability since very similar results were obtained from almost all of the repetition. Conclusion. Grinding the bone samples using the MillMix 20 has proven highly successful in recovery of high-quality powder from skeletal remains. We believe that the results obtained will contribute to the possibilities of using automated devices for grinding the bone samples, which would shorten the procedures for obtaining high-quality bone powder from skeletons in forensic laboratories.	6.4
Flow generated by an oscillating sphere in a quiescent fluid is a classical problem in fluid mechanics whose solution is used ubiquitously. Miniaturisation of mechanical devices to small scales and their operation at high frequencies in fluid, which is common in modern nanomechanical systems, can preclude the use of the unsteady Stokes equation for continuum flow. Here, we explore the combined effects of gas rarefaction and unsteady motion of a sphere, within the framework of the unsteady linearised Boltzmann-BGK (Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) equation. This equation is solved using the method of characteristics, and the resulting solution is valid for any oscillation frequency and arbitrary degrees of gas rarefaction. The resulting force provides the non-continuum counterpart to the (continuum) unsteady Stokes drag on a sphere. In contrast to the Stokes solution, where the flow is isothermal, non-continuum effects lead to a temperature jump at the sphere surface and non-isothermal flow. Unsteady effects and heat transport are found to mix strongly, leading to marked differences relative to the steady case. The solution to this canonical flow problem is expected to be of significant practical value in many applications, including the optical trapping of nanoparticles and the design and application of nanoelectromechanical systems. It also provides a benchmark for computational and approximate methods of solution for the Boltzmann equation.	3.4
The present investigation examined how three salient features of narrative thinking (situation model construction, linguistic concreteness, and perspective-taking) influenced the social inference process. Results of four experiments indicated that compared with those given other objectives, perceivers given narrative objectives were: (a) more likely to make situation rather than trait attributions for observed behaviors (Experiment 1), (b) less likely to make implicit trait inferences (Experiment 2), and (c) less likely to rely on behavior valence when making evaluative judgments (Experiment 4). Linguistic analyses indicated that narrative construction consistently entailed the creation of situation models of events and linguistic concreteness, but only situation model creation mediated the relationship between narrative and inferences. Experiment 3 confirmed the mediating role of situation models: Perceivers with narrative objectives made trait inferences only when behaviors were inconsistent with contextual information. The role of these core narrative features on social perceptions is discussed.	2.2
The objective of this systematic review is to identify current computer-assisted technologies used for managing patients with a need to re-establish craniofacial appearance, subjective discomfort and stomatognathic function, and the extent of their clinical documentation. Electronic search strategies were used for locating clinical studies in MEDLINE through PubMed and in the Cochrane library, and in the grey literature through searches on Google Scholar. The searches for commercial digital products for use in oral rehabilitation resulted in identifying 225 products per November 2016, used for patient diagnostics, communication and therapy purposes, and for other computer-assisted applications in context with oral rehabilitation. About one-third of these products were described in about 350 papers reporting from clinical human studies. The great majority of digital products for use in oral rehabilitation has no clinical documentation at all, while the products from a distinct minority of manufacturers have frequently appeared in more or less scientific reports. Moore's law apply also to digital dentistry, which predicts that the capacity of microprocessors will continue to become faster and with lower cost per performance unit, and innovative software programs will harness these improvements in performance. The net effect is the noticeable short product life cycle of digital products developed for use in oral rehabilitation and often lack of supportive clinical documentation. Nonetheless, clinicians must request clinically meaningful information about new digital products to assess net benefits for the patients or the dental professionals and not accept only technological verbiage as a basis for product purchases.	3.0
Ethnopharmacological relevance: Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. (Lamiaceae) is a traditional herb that is consumed in East Asian countries as a traditional medicine. This traditional herb has been documented for centuries to treat various diseases such as depression, allergies, inflammation and asthma. However, the effect of Perilla frutescens on skin has not been characterized well. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Perilla frutescens leaves extract (PLE) on ultraviolet radiation-induced extracellular matrix damage in human dermal fibroblasts and hairless mice skin. Materials and methods: Human dermal fibroblasts and Skh-1 hairless mice were irradiated with UV and treated with PLE. Protein and mRNA levels of various target molecules were analyzed by western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Histological changes of mouse skin were analyzed by H &E staining. To elucidate underlying mechanism of PLE, activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding assay and the measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed. Results: PLE significantly inhibited basal and UV-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression dose-dependently, and also decreased UV-induced phosphoryla Lion of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases. This inhibitory effects of PLE on MMP-1 and MMP-3 were mediated by reduction of ROS generation and AP-1 DNA binding activity induced by UV. Furthermore, PLE promoted type I procollagen production irrespective of UV irradiation. In the UV-irradiated animal model, PLE significantly reduced epidermal skin thickness and MMP-13 expression induced by UV. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that PLE has the protective effect against UV-induced dermal matrix damage. Therefore, we suggest that PLE can be a potential agent for prevention of skin aging.	5.1
Bundelkhand region of Central India is a hot spot of water scarcity, land degradation, poverty and poor socio-economic status. Impacts of integrated watershed development (IWD) interventions on water balance and different ecosystem services are analyzed in one of the selected watershed of 850 ha in Bundelkhand region. Improved soil, water and crop management interventions in Garhkundar-Dabar (GKD) watershed of Bundelkhand region in India enhanced ET to 64% as compared to 58% in untreated (control) watershed receiving 815 mm annual average rainfall. Reduced storm flow (21% vs. 34%) along with increased base flow (4.5% vs. 1.2%) and groundwater recharge (11% vs. 7%) of total rainfall received were recorded in treated watershed as compared to untreated control watershed. Economic Water productivity and total income increased from 2.5 to 5.0 INR m(-3) and 11,500 to 27,500 INR ha(-1) yr(-1) after implementing integrated watershed development interventions in GKD watershed, respectively. Moreover IWD interventions helped in reducing soil loss more than 50% compared to control watershed. The results demonstrated that integrated watershed management practices addressed issues of poverty in GM watershed. Benefit to cost ratio of project interventions was found three and pay back period within four years suggest economic feasibility to scale-up IWD interventions in Bundelkhend region. Scaling-up of integrated watershed management in drought prone rainfed areas with enabling policy and institutional support is expected to promote equity and livelihood along with strengthening various ecosystem services, however, region-specific analysis is needed to assess trade-offs for downstream areas along with onsite impact.

The role of Boolean functions is prominent in several areas including cryptography, sequences, and coding theory. Therefore, various methods for the construction of Boolean functions with desired properties are of direct interest. New motivations on the role of Boolean functions in cryptography with attendant new properties have emerged over the years. There are still many combinations of design criteria left unexplored and in this matter evolutionary computation can play a distinct role. This article concentrates on two scenarios for the use of Boolean functions in cryptography. The first uses Boolean functions as the source of the nonlinearity in filter and combiner generators. Although relatively well explored using evolutionary algorithms, it still presents an interesting goal in terms of the practical sizes of Boolean functions. The second scenario appeared rather recently where the objective is to find Boolean functions that have various orders of the correlation immunity and minimal Hamming weight. In both these scenarios we see that evolutionary algorithms are able to find high-quality solutions where genetic programming performs the best.	0.3
Based on the same toxic level of 0.6% LC50 for 96-h and the severe situation of water pollution, we compared effects of chronic Zn (180 mu g L-1) and Cd exposures (30 mu g L-1) on growth, survival, histology, ultrastructure, and oxidative stress in the liver of zebrafish for 5 weeks. Growth performance and survival rate remained relatively constant under Zn stress, but was reduced under Cd exposure. Cd exposure also induced severe pyknotic nuclei, evident ultrastructure damage, and considerable lipid inclusions in the hepatocytes. However, these phenomena were not pronounced under Zn exposure. The negative effects caused by Cd may be explained by an increase in hepatic oxidative damage, as reflected by the enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PC). The reduced activity of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and catalase (CAT) may result in the enhanced hepatic oxidative damage, though the mRNA and protein levels of both genes increased and remained unchanged respectively. On the contrary, Zn up-regulated the levels of mRNA, protein and activity of Cu/Zn-SOD, which may contribute to the decreased LPO levels. Nonetheless, the sharply up-regulated mRNA levels of CAT did not induce an increase in the protein and activity levels of CAT under Zn stress. Furthermore, transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression parelleled with its target genes, suggesting that Nrf2 is required for the protracted induction of antioxidant genes. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that essential and non-essential metals induced some differences in oxidative damage in fish. The differences were not caused by the transcriptional level of related genes but depended on post-transcriptional modifications. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	4.4
The job of the project manager (PM) is both exciting and complex, requiring a range of skills and adaptability, especially in a different culture and that, to be effective and therefore carry out a project. Therefore, the effectiveness of those facing a multicultural team or assigned to international projects depends not only on their technical skills, but also to a large extent intercultural skills, to personal qualities, including the ability to adapt and collaboration in a different cultural environment. This research focuses in this context and proposes to study precisely the relationship between intercultural competence and efficiency of PM in intercultural situations. To define the relationship between factors of intercultural competence and effectiveness in intercultural situations, four questionnaires and one interview were used on a sample of 125 subjects (a heterogeneous sample from the University of Limoges, France). Some factors, such as the person perception are the same as those defined by the authors and theorists. The four questionnaires used describe the intercultural competences, communication style, the emotional intelligence level and the potential role that a person could play when he/she is part of a team. The first test used was the Multicultural Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), questionnaire used for measuring the group behavioral. The second test used was the communication style questionnaire, used to identify the main communication styles within an organization: action-oriented communication style, process-oriented communication style, people-oriented communication style and ideas oriented communication style. The emotional intelligence questionnaire was the third test used to identify the importance of the basic skills that determine the success of an organization. The last test used, the Belbin Team Role Inventory, also called the Belbin Self-Perception Inventory was used to measure the preference for Team Roles (Coordinator, Shaper, Monitor Evaluator, Team worker, Implementer, Plant, Resource Investigator, Finisher, and the Specialist a Team Role added by Belbin in 1993). The research variables used: age, nationality, residence (urban/rural), high school graduate and profile. All subjects worked in collaborative activities or projects. From the beginning, all the subjects were informed about the research activity and the data confidentiality. The subjects' average age was 36 years old. Regarding their residency 78% are living in an urban residency and only 22% are living in a rural residency. The subjects' nationality was: French, Chinese, Ivorian, Spanish and Swiss. For data collections were used four questionnaires and one interview. Data collection results began in May 2013 and ended in July 2013. Statistical processing will be performed with the specific version of Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and Sphinx Plus(2)- Lexica Edition - V5. Based on the literature review, in the research was identified that cultural heterogeneity had a significant influence on the process and could lead to the conflicts emergence with a negative impact on the teams' results. Managing multicultural project teams and the ability to manage diversity will probably be the key skills required for the managers of tomorrow.	2.2
Background: Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of FMR1 premutation carriers is at an increased risk for cognitive, emotional, and medical conditions. However, because the premutation is rarely diagnosed at birth, the early developmental trajectories of children with a premutation are not known. Methods: This exploratory study examined the cognitive, communication, and social-behavioral profiles of 26 infants with a premutation who were identified through participation in a newborn screening for fragile X syndrome pilot study. In this study, families whose newborn screened positive for an FMR1 premutation were invited to participate in a longitudinal study of early development. Twenty-six infants with the premutation and 21 matched, screen-negative comparison babies were assessed using validated standardized measures at 6-month intervals starting as young as 3 months of age. The babies were assessed up to seven times over a 4-year period. Results: The premutation group was not statistically different from the comparison group on measures of cognitive development, adaptive behavior, temperament, or overall communication. However, the babies with the premutation had a significantly different developmental trajectory on measures of nonverbal communication and hyperresponsivity to sensory experiences. They also were significantly more hyporesponsive at all ages than the comparison group. Cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat length was linearly associated with overall cognitive development. Conclusions: These results suggest that infants with a premutation may present with subtle developmental differences as young as 12 months of age that may be early markers of later anxiety, social deficits, or other challenges thought to be experienced by a subset of carriers.	2.3
Situation prediction is an increasingly important focus in network security. The information of incoming security situation in the network is important and helps the network administrator to make good decisions before taking some defense remedies towards the attack exploitation. Although Grey Verhulst prediction model has demonstrated satisfactory results in other fields but some further investigations are still required to improve its performance in predicting incoming network security situation. In order to attain higher predictive accuracy of the existing Grey Verhulst prediction models, this paper tends to seek an enhancement of the adaptive Grey Verhulst security situation prediction model by forecasting the incoming residual based on the historical prediction residuals. The proposed model applied Kalman Filtering algorithm to predict the residual in the next time-frame and closer the deviation between the predicted and actual network security situation. Benchmark datasets such as DARPA 1999 and 2000 have been used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. The results shown that the enhanced adaptive Grey Verhulst prediction model has better prediction capability in predicting incoming network security situation and also achieved a significant improvement compared to other Grey Verhulst prediction models.	0.2
When it comes to person perception, does one judge a book by its cover? Perceivers made judgments of liking, and of personality, based on a photograph of an unknown other, and at least 1 month later, made judgments following a face-to-face interaction with the same person. Photograph-based liking judgments predicted interaction-based liking judgments, and, to a lesser extent, photograph-based personality judgments predicted interaction-based personality judgments (except for extraversion). Consistency in liking judgments (1) partly reflected behavioral confirmation (i.e., perceivers with favorable photograph-based judgments behaved more warmly toward the target during the live interaction, which elicited greater target warmth); (2) explained, at least in part, consistency in personality judgments (reflecting a halo effect); and (3) remained robust even after controlling for perceiver effects, target effects, and perceived attractiveness. These findings support the view that even after having read a book, one still, to some extent, judges it by its cover.	2.2
In manufacturing engineering optimization, it is often that one encounters scenarios that are multi-objective (where each of the objectives portray different aspects of the problem). Thus, it is crucial for the engineer to have access to multiple solution choices before selecting of the best solution. In this work, a novel approach that merges meta-heuristic algorithms with the Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI) method is introduced. This method then is used generate optimal solution options to the green sand mould system problem. This NBI based method provides a near-uniform spread of the Pareto frontier in which multiple solutions with gradual trade-offs in the objectives are obtained. Some comparative studies were then carried out with the algorithms developed and used in this work and that from some previous work. Analysis on the performance as well as the quality of the solutions produced by the algorithms is presented here. (C) 2012 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

By 2030 South Africa (SA), a developing country, is predicted to be severely impacted by physical water scarcity. In order to avert a future water crisis, the country needs to find ways to reduce its reliance on conventional surface water schemes based on impoundments on rivers. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an alternative water resource. To date, the viability of domestic RWH within an urban setting has not been adequately considered in SA. The purpose of this study was thus to address this omission through the detailed modelling of a representative catchment. The Liesbeek River Catchment in Cape Town comprising some 6 200 domestic properties in 6 suburbs covering an area of around 1 300 ha - was chosen for this purpose; and a new computational tool, the Urban Rainwater/Stormwater Harvesting model (URSHM), was developed to take best advantage of the available data. The analysis showed that: RWH was only economically viable for a minority of property owners; climate change is likely to have limited impact on the performance of RWH systems; and - contrary to some claims - RWH is an unreliable means of attenuating peak stormwater flows.	4.3
Positive youth development is critical for African American youth as they negotiate a social, political, and historical landscape grounded in systemic inequities and racism. One possible, yet understudied, approach to promote positive youth development is to increase African American youth consciousness and connection to their Africentric values and culture. The primary purpose of this article was to investigate the degree to which cultural and group consciousness factors (i.e., cultural orientation, Africentric values, and racial socialization) predicted positive youth development (i.e., future orientation, prosocial behavior, political/community, and social justice/equality civic mindedness) and how these might differ by gender. This article utilized survey data from 1,930 African American youth participants of the Pen or Pencil mentoring program. Results generally indicated that cultural orientation, Africentric values and, to a lesser degree, racial socialization, predicted positive youth development variables, with these effects varying by gender. These findings suggest that enhancing cultural consciousness may support the positive development of African American youth, although male and female youth may respond to these efforts in different ways.	2.4
In today's data centers supporting Internet-scale computing and input/output (I/O) services, increasinglymore network-intensive applications are deployed on the network as a service. To this end, it is critical for the applications to quickly retrieve requests from the network and send their responses to the network. To facilitate this network function, operating system usually provides an event notification mechanism so that the applications (or the library) know if the network is ready to supply data for them to read or to receive data for them to write. As a widely used and representative notification mechanism, epoll in Linux provides a scalable and high-performance implementation by allowing applications to specifically indicate which connections and what events on them need to be watched. As epoll has been used in some major systems, including key-value (KV) systems, such as Redis and Memcached, and web server systems such as NGINX, we have identified a substantial performance issue in its use. For the sake of efficiency, applications usually use epoll's system calls to inform the kernel exactly of what events they are interested in and always keep the information up-to-date. However, in a system with demanding network traffic, such a rigid maintenance of the information is not necessary and the excess number of system calls for this purpose can substantially degrade the system's performance. In this paper, we use Redis as an example to explore the issue. We propose a strategy of informing the kernel of the interest events in a manner adaptive to the current network load, so that the epoll system calls can be reduced and the events can be efficiently delivered. We have implemented an event-polling library, named as FlexPoll, purely in user-level without modifying any kernel code. Our evaluation on Redis shows that the query throughput can be improved by up to 46.9% on micro-benchmarks, and even up to 67.8% on workloads emulating real-world access patterns. FlexPoll is a generic mechanism thus it can be adopted by other applications in a straightforward manner, such as NGINX and Memcached.	0.4
Studying the patterns hidden in gene expression data helps to understand the functionality of genes. But due to the large volume of genes and the complexity of biological networks it is difficult to study the resulting mass of data which often consists of millions of measurements. In order to reveal natural structures and to identify interesting patterns from the given gene expression data set, clustering techniques are applied. Semi-supervised classification is a new direction of machine learning. It requires huge unlabeled data and a few labeled data. Semi-supervised classification in general performs better than unsupervised classification. But to the best of our knowledge there are no works for solving gene expression data clustering problem using semi-supervised classification techniques. In the current paper we have made an attempt to solve the gene expression data clustering problem using a multiobjective optimization based semi-supervised classification technique with the aim to attain good quality partitions by using few labeled data. In order to generate the labeled data, initially Fuzzy C-means clustering technique is applied. In order to automatically determine the partitioning, multiple cluster centers corresponding to a cluster are encoded in the form of a string. In order to compute the quality of the obtained partitioning, values of five objective functions are computed. The effectiveness of this proposed semi-supervised clustering technique is demonstrated on five publicly available benchmark gene expression data sets. Comparison results with the existing techniques for gene expression data clustering prove that the proposed method is the most effective one. Statistical and biological significance tests have also been carried out.	0.1
Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been theorized as a stable, early-emerging trait influencing outgroup evaluations, a view supported by evidence from cross-sectional and two-wave longitudinal research. Yet, the limitations of identifying causal paths with cross-sectional and two-wave designs are increasingly being acknowledged. This article presents the first use of multi-wave data to test the over-time relationship between SDO and outgroup affect among young people. We use cross-lagged and latent growth modeling (LGM) of a three-wave data set employing Norwegian adolescents (over 2 years, N = 453) and a five-wave data set with American university students (over 4 years, N = 748). Overall, SDO exhibits high temporal rank-order stability and predicts changes in outgroup affect. This research represents the strongest test to date of SDO's role as a stable trait that influences the development of prejudice, while highlighting LGM as a valuable tool for social and political psychology.	2.0
The parent-report Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-P) is a widely used scale that assesses children's and adolescents' strengths and difficulties. The present study applied this scale to Italian adolescents and compared the current results with previous Chinese findings and the United Kingdom norm. Participants were 422 Italian parents and their adolescent children. Parents and adolescents answered the parent-report and the self-report SDQ, respectively. Results showed that the five-factor first-order model was better than other competing models. Cronbach's alpha of emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, prosocial behavior, and total difficulties was .63, .52, .69, .51, .59, and .77 respectively for mother-report measure, and .67, .48, .67, .46, .55, and .79 respectively for father-report measure. Parent-adolescent agreements ranged from low to medium, whereas mother-father agreements were large. Parents did not rate boys and girls as well as early-adolescence and mid-adolescence differently. Italian parents rated their adolescent children to have lower levels of hyperactivity, peer problems, total difficulties, and higher levels of prosocial behavior than Chinese parents; and Italian mothers rated their adolescent children to have lower levels of hyperactivity than United Kingdom parents. In conclusion, the current findings suggest both strengths and inadequacies of the SDQ-P for Italian adolescents.	2.4
Model order reduction (MOR) techniques play a crucial role in the computer-aided design of modern integrated circuits, where they are used to reduce the size of parasitic networks. Unfortunately, the efficient reduction of passive networks with many ports is still an open problem. Existing techniques do not scale well with the number of ports, and lead to dense reduced models that burden subsequent simulations. In this paper, we propose TurboMOR-RC, a novel MOR technique for the efficient reduction of passive RC networks. TurboMOR-RC is based on moment-matching at dc, achieved through efficient congruence transformations based on Householder reflections. A novel feature of TurboMOR-RC is the block-diagonal structure of the reduced models, that makes them more efficient than the dense models produced by existing techniques. Moreover, the model structure allows for an insightful interpretation of the reduction process in terms of system theory. Numerical results show that TurboMOR-RC scales more favorably than existing techniques in terms of reduction time, simulation time, and memory consumption.	3.0
Recent data indicate that there are large disparities in the use of opioid analgesics to control breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP) in Europe and worldwide. While it is clear that affordability is a key factor, it is certainly not the only one, and other factors, such as cultural differences and overall awareness, are undoubtedly responsible. More work remains to be done to overcome barriers in the use of these medications when warranted. When prescribing a medication for BTcP, it must be considered that its time profile is different from chronic persistent pain. The best control of background pain can best be achieved with a low dose of an extended opioid, and managing BTcP with a rapid-onset opioid, providing a good combination of overall pain control and lower opioid exposure. Notwithstanding their efficacy, greater attention needs to be paid to inappropriate use of opioids. It is important to evaluate patients for potential opioid misuse, including assessment of risk factors, and aberrant drug-taking behaviours must be investigated. In our institution, several measures have been adopted in this patient population in order to prevent aberrant opioid-induced behaviours. The adoption of some or all of these principles, depending on the individual patient and treatment setting, can undoubtedly help to reduce the risk of developing an aberrant behaviour related to opioid use as rescue medication for BTcP.	5.0
Confined impinging jets (CIJs) are highly efficient mixers. The scales of mixing in CIJs are controlled by the opposed jets interaction. A mechanistic model is described here, which accurately predicts the impinging position of the opposed jets for a large range of flow rate ratios. The impinging point position is shown to impact the dynamic properties of the flow and the achieved mixing quality. The opposed jets kinetic energy ratio is shown to have a critical impact on mixing, similar to the Reynolds number. A mixing chamber design relation is proposed and verified for the opposed injectors diameters ratio, d(1)/d(2), which enables to operate CIJs under optimum mixing conditions for large ranges of flow rate ratios, viscosity and density ratios between the opposed streams. Optimum d(1)/d(2) values have asymptotes for large and small Reynolds number depending on the process stoichiometry viscosity, and density ratios of the opposed jet streams.

When talking about energy conservation, Rebound Effect (RE) is always concerned, which defined as the increasing energy consumption relative to the counterfactual predicted by technological progress because of efficiency induced decrease in the real price of energy services. In this paper, we try to find a way to figure out the RE through calculating the substitution relations accord with the definition. Based on the trans-log cost function and considering the asymmetric impact on energy-cost share equation, the paper applies Allen-Uzawa substitution elasticity to establish the price-oriented analysis diagram of fossil-energy consumption RE. 'Using time series data, applying the joint method of the dynamic OLS (DOLS) and the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR), the RE in China's electricity generation sector is estimated. The results showed that the RE is 11.6% in China's electricity generation sector if allowing for asymmetric price effects, which indicates that China's power generation sector generally displays a feature of energy saving.	1.0
Purpose: A subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) displays social difficulties; however, it is not clear if individuals with comorbid autism spectrum disorders account for these difficulties. Methods: We compared social function using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in 43 young females with first-episode AN who did not have comorbid autism spectrum disorder, 28 individuals recovered from adolescent-onset AN, and 41 healthy comparison individuals (age range 14-22 years). We measured adaptive behavior with the Vineland-II parent questionnaire, and aspects of social cognition with psychological tests, such as the Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes test, Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity short version, The Awareness of Social Inference Test, Animated Triangles, and the CANTAB Affective Go/No-go task. Results: Participants with first-episode AN and those recovered from AN displayed difficulties in social function, which were not associated with body mass index or other state factors of the disorder in those with first-episode AN. Mood problems and anxiety were not associated with these difficulties. Parents rated participants with first-episode AN lower than recovered and control participants on the Socialization Domain of Vineland-II. Finally, only participants recovered from AN demonstrated deficits in specific domains of social cognition: perceiving nonverbal bodily gesture and vocal prosody. Conclusions: Young females with first-episode AN and those recovered from AN displayed impairments in social function, which may represent more stable traits of the disorder. Only participants recovered from AN demonstrated deficits in social cognition. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.	2.1
In this paper, two discrete-time control schemes are presented for induction motors (IMs) based on the discrete-time sliding-mode technique. The first controller is designed using the equivalent control method. The second controller is based on a discrete-time equivalent of the super-twisting algorithm, in which the sliding-mode dynamics is robustified by adding an integral action. The non-measurable rotor fluxes are estimated by two observers. The first observer design is based on a simple copy of the rotor flux dynamics, whereas the second observer design is based on the sliding-mode technique. A simulation study was carried out for the evaluation of the closed-loop performance of the IM at different sampling periods and to compare results with other discrete-time control techniques. Moreover, the robust performance of the closed-loop IM is investigated under external and internal perturbations. The simulation study predicts that the IM, when in closed-loop with one of the proposed controllers, still performs well at a sampling time of 1250 mu s, whereas other control strategies start to lose accuracy. Real-time experiments were finally carried out, where the good performance of the proposed strategy is verified.	1.4
In order to locate source signal more accurately in authorized frequency bands, a novel primary user localization algorithm based on compressive sensing (PU-CSL) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) is proposed in this paper. In comparison to existing centroid locating algorithms, PU-CSL shows higher locating accuracy for integrally exploring correlation between source signal and secondary users (SUs). Energy detection is first adopted for collecting the energy fingerprint of source signal at each SU, then degree of correlation between source signal and SUs is reconstructed based on compressive sensing (CS), which determines weights of centroid coordinates. A weighted centroid scheme is finally utilized to estimate source position. Simulation results show that PU-CSL has smaller maximum error of positioning and root-mean-square error. Moreover, the proposed PU-CSL algorithm possess excellent location accuracy and strong anti-noise performance.	0.2
A new approach to implement a smart ecosystem for freight transportation is proposed. It is aimed to improve efficiency, safety, security and sustainability by including ambient intelligence in both the containers and the infrastructure that supports them. It involves technological as well as organizational and logistic improvements to achieve this goal. The approach is developed in an R+D project named ECOTRANSIT funded by the Spanish MINECO and involving the University of Seville and the Public University of Navarre. The proposal represents a qualitative step beyond existing projects, with innovation in key areas such as logistics and in critical enabling technologies like microelectronics and ICTs.	4.0
This study provides a timely and flexible location-aware service (LAS) to mobile users in a dynamic environment. Few previous studies have examined similar concepts. In the proposed methodology, the inaccuracy of user positioning and the uncertainty of manual service preparation are considered and modeled by using fuzzy numbers. These numbers are used as inputs to establish a fuzzy integer-nonlinear programming model applied in identifying the most suitable service location and path. A required service is prepared immediately before a user reaches the recommended service location. To manage simultaneous requests from multiple users, the concepts of fuzzy modeling, route planning, and parallel machine scheduling are combined. Thus, the proposed LAS can distribute multiple users among service locations, thereby enabling users to avoid unnecessary waiting, which is a major problem associated with existing LASs. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, two experiments were conducted in small areas in Taichung City and Taipei City, Taiwan. The experimental results revealed that the waiting times of users were substantially reduced, increasing the average satisfaction level. However, improving the accuracy of user positioning does not necessarily facilitate achieving a high average satisfaction level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.0
Design education is in need of a wider restructuring to accommodate new developments and paradigmatic shifts brought forth by the information age, all of which capitalise a move towards complexity theory, systems science and digital technologies. The intention of this article is to approach one particular aspect of this need: that is, how basic design education can be reconsidered to establish the arguably broken link between the 'learning by doing' tradition of a Bauhaus-oriented basic design education with the computational and parametric logic necessitated by contemporary design technologies. The authors present the overall outlines of a basic design course as offered in Beykent University Department of Industrial Design in Istanbul, Turkey. The programme consists of a series of exercises grouped in five modules and two 'binders' that are structured to link the fundamental notions and operations of design thinking covered in basic design courses of the first year with the analytical and computational-reasoning competencies that are developed mostly in the later years of design education.	3.0
Shoreline monitoring is essential for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). It provides the necessary information needed to manage the settlement of coastal areas, establishes guidelines for management of socioeconomic activities within the coastal areas, provides information necessary for recovery actions of beach regeneration, and provides a reference baseline for studies related to climate change in coastal zones. Shoreline monitoring methods are largely dependent on goals, costs, implementation, and applicability. For monitoring of short coastal shorelines (e.g., tens to hundreds of kilometers), global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based methods are emerging as low-cost approaches that offer rapid, weather-independent, and quickly updatable products that could benefit policy makers when high costs of traditional methods, such as photogrammetry and remote sensing, are of concern. However, various GNSS methods applicable to shoreline monitoring exist, making it difficult for decision makers to choose a suitable approach. Using a case study of the Pernambuco State ICZM in Brazil, this study evaluates three of the most commonly used GNSS-based shoreline monitoring methods, that is, relative kinematic (RK), real-time kinematic (RTK), and precise point positioning (PPP) methods. It also provides a comprehensive analysis of their strengths and limitations. The results highlight the issues and important considerations in choosing an economically viable GNSS method for mapping shoreline changes, particularly for supporting ICZM policies.	4.2
Nowadays elders, often find it difficult to keep track of their cognitive and functional abilities required for remaining independent in their homes. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are the Ambient Intelligence based technologies for the support of daily activities to elders. Traditional rehabilitation is an example of a common activity elders may require and that usually implies they move to the rehabilitation clinics, which is the main reason for treatment discontinuation. Tele-rehabilitation is a solution that not only may help elders but also their family members and health professionals to monitor elder's treatment. The purpose of this paper is to present a tele-rehabilitation system that uses the motion-tracking sensor of the Kinect, to allow the elderly users natural interaction, combined with a set of external sensors as a form of input. Data fusion techniques are applied in order to integrate these data for detecting right movements and to monitor elder's treatment in the rehabilitation process.	4.0
Changes in chemical, microstructural, and barrier properties of two commonly used and commercially available waxes - a microcrystalline wax (Renaissance wax) and a microcrystalline and carnauba blended wax (Butcher's Boston Polish Amber Paste Wax) - for the prevention of corrosion on outdoor metalwork were investigated. The waxes were applied to both plain and patinated substrates of bronze and steel, and properties of the films were measured before and after weathering. Accelerated weathering was performed by accelerated UV-B illumination/condensation and outdoor weathering under standard South Florida exposures and in Portland, OR. Comparison of Fourier transformed micro-infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra enabled characterization of chemical functional groups of these waxes as they weathered and showed relative increases in methylene character suggestive of cross-linking, appearance of terminal vinyl bands suggestive of chain-scission, and evidence of oxidative film damage. After annealing, microstructural changes were observed by thin-film X-ray diffraction and showed a decrease in crystallinity, which indicates a decrease in barrier properties. The barrier properties of the wax films after weathering were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and equivalent electrical circuits provided insights into the physical state of the films. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data showed that the permittivity of the weathered waxed panels increased, which was observed as a decrease in coating resistance and an increase in coating capacitance. Photographic documentation of the substrates showed extensive visible corrosion upon weathering. Our results demonstrate that waxed metal panels exposed outdoors do not have a period of stability when the protective qualities of the film do not change. This suggests that while waxes are commonly used to protect against corrosion, their barrier properties are affected by flaws in the microstructure and their susceptibility to chemical alteration during weathering. Results from a blind study with professional conservators as the participants are presented, to elucidate how they rank the importance of such factors as gloss and working lifetime when selecting protective coatings.	1.2
Atmospheric water vapor plays an important role in hydrologic cycle and climate change of the Earth. A number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (TPW) using microwave or optical remote sensing. In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter Delta Tb-18.7/Delta Tb-23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

This article reports an observational study exploring the effects of naturally-occurring hearing impairments on musicians' behaviour and communication with each other while rehearsing and performing. Two groups of three pianists and three flautists, one in each group with normal hearing, and the others moderately or profoundly deaf, formed duos working on two pieces of music: a movement from a Bach flute sonata and a new composition. The profoundly deaf musicians spent significantly more time looking at and talking to their co-performers than moderately deaf and hearing players. In response, hearing players looked at and talked more to their profoundly deaf partners. Profoundly deaf players also spent significantly less time on complete runs of the pieces from start to finish, without stops. While these findings have implications for the teaching and practice of musicians with and without hearing impairments, we suggest that social factors are as, if not more, important to the success of collaborative musical performance.	2.3
The development and performance characterization of a new differential pressure-based flow meter for human breath measurements is presented in this article. The device, called a Confined Pitot Tube, is comprised of a pipe with an elliptically shaped expansion cavity located in the pipe center, and an elliptical disk inside the expansion cavity. The elliptical disk, named Pitot Tube, is exchangeable, and has different diameters, which are smaller than the diameter of the elliptical cavity. The gap between the disk and the cavity allows the flow of human breath to pass through. The disk causes an obstruction in the flow inside the pipe, but the elliptical cavity provides an expansion for the flow to circulate around the disk, decreasing the overall flow resistance. We characterize the new sensor flow experimentally and theoretically, using Comsol Multiphysics((R)) software with laminar and turbulent models. We also validate the sensor, using inhalation and exhalation tests and a reference method. (c) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 956-964, 2016	3.4
Computer-aided design (CAD) models of thin-walled parts, such as sheet metal or plastic parts, are often represented by their corresponding midsurfaces for computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis. The reason being, 2D surface elements, such as shell elements, which need to be placed on the midsurface, provide fairly accurate results, while requiring far lesser computational resources time compared to the analysis using 3D solid elements. Existing approachesof midsurface computation are not reliable and robust. They result in ill-connected midsurfaces having missing patches, gaps, overlaps, etc. These errors need to be corrected, mostly by a manual and time-consuming process, requiring from hours to even days. Thus, an automatic and robust technique for computation of a well-connected midsurface is the need of the hour. This paper proposes an approachwhich, instead of working on the complex final solid shape, typically represented by B-rep (boundary representation), leverages feature information available in the modern CAD models for techniques such as defeaturing, generalization, and decomposition. Here, first, the model is defeaturedby removing irrelevant features, generating a simplified shape called gross shape. The remaining features are then generalizedto their corresponding generic loft-feature equivalents. The model is then decomposed into sub-volumes, called cells having respective owner loft features. A graph is populated, with the cells at the graph nodes. The nodes are classified into midsurface patch-generating nodes (called 'solid cells' or sCells) and interaction-resolving nodes (called 'interface cells' or iCells). Using owner loft feature's parameters, sCells compute their own midsurface patches. Using a generic logic, the patches then get connected appropriately in the iCells, resulting in a well-connected midsurface. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by computing well-connected midsurfaces of various real-life sheet metal parts.	3.0
Increasing evidence indicates that patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA), including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies, have an increased risk of arrhythmic events, significantly contributing to the higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality observed in these subjects compared to the general population. Although the mechanisms accounting for such an arrhythmogenic substrate are not fully understood, the main role is probably played by chronic systemic inflammation, able to accelerate the development of structural CVD, as well as to directly affect cardiac electrophysiology. In the past decade, biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of CIA by highly enhancing the probability to effectively control disease activity and its systemic consequences, including cardiovascular involvement. Accordingly, accumulating data demonstrated that by potently inhibiting systemic inflammation, biologic drugs can reduce CVD progression and ameliorate arrhythmic risk parameters, with a putative beneficial impact on arrhythmia incidence. Nevertheless, a significant number of reports from clinical trials and postmarketing experience suggest that some of these medications, particularly TNF inhibitor monoclonal antibodies and rituximab, may in some circumstances precipitate arrhythmia occurrence, probably by acutely amplifying myocardial electric instability intrinsically associated with these diseases. In this review, we analyze the intricate link between biologic drugs and arrhythmias in CIA in the effort to identify which factors are involved in the fine-tuning of antiarrhythmic/pro-arrhythmic balance, and understand how this knowledge should be translated in the clinical practice to obtain the most favorable benefit-to-risk profile when biologic drugs are used in these patients.	5.3
Mental illness and substance use are overrepresented within urban homeless populations. This paper compared substance use patterns between homeless individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum (SS) and bipolar disorders (BD) using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. From a sample of 497 subjects drawn from Vancouver, Canada who participated in the At Home/ Chez Soi study, 146 and 94 homeless individuals were identified as BD and SS, respectively. In the previous 12 months, a greater proportion of BD homeless reported greater use of cocaine (chi(2)= 20.0, p = 0.000), amphetamines (chi(2) = 13,8, p = 0.000), opiates (chi(2) = 24.6, p = 0.000), hallucinogens (chi(2) = 11.7, p = 0.000), cannabinoids (chi(2) = 5.05, p = 0.034), and tranquilizers (chi(2) = 7.95, p = 0.004) compared to SS. Cocaine and opiates were significantly associated with BD homeless (chi(2) = 39.06, df = 2, p < 0.000). The present study illustrates the relationship between substance use and BD in a vulnerable urban population of homeless, affected by adverse psychosocial factors and severe psychiatric conditions.	5.0
Background: Reports of frequent manifestation of allergic diseases in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been the subject of mounting clinical interest. However, evidence supporting the association between ADHD and allergies is inconsistent and has yet to be systematically reviewed. The objective of this study was to compile and assess available studies on the association between ADHD and allergic diseases in children. Methods: A comprehensive search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and CINAHL databases was completed in 23 November 2015. The inclusion criteria for studies were that the research assessed allergic diseases in children, 18 years of age and younger, with a diagnosis of ADHD and that a distinct comparison group was incorporated. Any comparative studies, encompassing both randomized controlled trials and observational studies, were considered for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the selected studies by the use of validated assessment tools, performed data extraction and conducted meta-analysis according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Results: Five eligible studies were included in this systematic review. Of these studies, three were case-control and two were cross sectional studies. A majority of information from the five studies was classified as having low or unclear risk of bias. The meta-analysis showed an association between children with ADHD and asthma compared with the control groups (OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.57 - 2.07; five studies, low quality of evidence), but did not indicate an association between food allergy and ADHD (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.88 - 1.47; three studies very low quality of evidence). The odds of experiencing allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic conjunctivitis were slightly higher in children with ADHD compared with control groups, though a substantial statistical heterogeneity was notable in the overall effect estimates. Conclusions: The findings from this review and meta-analysis show that children with ADHD are more likely to have asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic conjunctivitis than their counterparts. Interventions including strategies for managing allergies in children with ADHD would be beneficial.	5.1
The production of azo derivatives of a di-amino analogue of Troger's base (Hunlich base), by employing the standard procedures of diazotization, azo-coupling and Williamson etherification is described here. These versatile molecules possess a.-shaped core, photoswitchable groups and some carry two modifiable extremities to enable further synthesis or molecular assembly. The synthesis is straightforward and requires inexpensive starting materials, which facilitates their application to different fields of research such as light-driven molecular machine design.	3.3
The efficient operation of reservoirs relies on the effective release of water during flooding, requiring a good understanding of spillways and their hydraulics. A series of experiments was conducted in a laboratory flume on a stepped spillway model with moderate slope (26.68) for discharges up to 0.0121 m(3)/s. Using regular uniform horizontal steps of 5 cm height, then several new step configurations including inclined and horizontal curved steps with and without reflector blocks, the flow patterns were investigated. The energy losses over a horizontal stepped spillway were compared with those obtained in a number of similar, previous studies, and with the results obtained for the new step configurations. Good agreement was shown with previous results for horizontal steps, and the inclined and horizontal curved steps dissipated about twice as much energy as the horizontal steps. The results highlight the importance of considering a variety of step forms in spillway design where flows are unpredictable and energy dissipation is important.	3.1
Over recent decades, water conservation have become increasingly an utmost important issue for debate, and this includes the domestic sector. Reducing demand water by improving the efficiency of water use in domestic sector requires an understanding of how water is used and in what ways water savings can be realized. The focus of this global, web-based, consumer questionnaire survey was to analyze individual consumer attitudes towards using water in manual dishwashing and understand the likelihood of a prospect of changing the daily manual dishwashing method resulting to a more efficient domestic usage of water. This study was designed to investigate the manual dishwashing technique used in the 5249 households of nine different countries - China, Germany, Italy, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, India, South Africa and Argentina. Besides socio-demographics, technical questions like cleaning steps, hygiene questions motivational question, environmental awareness questions, questions on payment for water and electricity, questions on information sources about household work were included in the study. It was found that the awareness to conserve water was common among the Asian participants but it necessarily was not practiced in the households as individual washing of dishes was found to be quite high. Among the many outcomes, important one was that running tap method' was found to be most prevalent (86%) among Russian participants, complimenting their detached approach towards conserving domestic water usage. In South American countries like Brazil (66%) and Argentina (51%), high occurrence of running tap rinse' was found to be a common practice, confirming the lack of conscious use of water in manual dishwashing in the subcontinent. Based on the overall responses, awareness of a new and efficient technique of manual dishwashing could be propagated through the most voted mediums of Internet (81%) and TV (69%).	1.0
Eyes play an important role in expressing emotions in nonverbal communication. In the present study, emotional expression classification was performed based on the features that were automatically extracted from the eye area. First, the face area and the eye area were automatically extracted from the captured image. Afterwards, the parameters to be used for the analysis through discrete wavelet transformation were obtained from the eye area. Using these parameters, emotional expression analysis was performed through artificial intelligence techniques. As the result of the experimental studies, 6 universal emotions consisting of expressions of happiness, sadness, surprise, disgust, anger and fear were classified at a success rate of 84% using artificial neural networks.	2.3
The ability to attribute and represent others' mental states (e.g., beliefs; so-called theory of mind) is essential for participation in human social interaction. Despite a considerable body of research using tasks in which protagonists in the participants' attentional focus held false or true beliefs, the question of automatic belief attribution to bystander agents has received little attention. In the current study, we presented adults and 6-year-olds (N = 92) with an implicit computer-based avoidance false-belief task in which participants were asked to place an object into one of three boxes. While doing so, we manipulated the beliefs of an irrelevant human-like or non-human-like bystander agent who was visible on the screen. Importantly, the bystander agent's beliefs were irrelevant for solving the task. Still, children's decision making was significantly influenced by the bystander agent's beliefs even if this was a non-human-like self-propelled object. Such an influence did not become obvious in adults' deliberate decisions but occurred only in their reaction times, which suggests that they also processed the bystander agent's beliefs but were able to suppress the influence of such beliefs on their behavior regulation. The results of a control study (N = 53) ruled out low-level explanations and confirmed that self-propelledness of agents is a necessary factor for belief attribution to occur. Thus, not only do humans spontaneously ascribe beliefs to self-propelled bystander agents, but those beliefs even influence meaningful decisions in children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Round the globe mobile devices like Smartphone, PDAs & tablets are playing an essential role in every person day to day lives. Various operating systems such as android, ios, blackberry etc provides a platform for smart devices. Google's Android is a one of the most popular and user friendly open source software platform for mobile devices. Along with its convenience people are likely to download and install malicious applications developed to misguide the user which will create a security gap to penetrate for the attacker. Hackers are inclined to discover and exploit the new vulnerabilities which will bring forth with the latest version of Android. In this paper, we concentrate on examining and understanding the vulnerabilities exist in android operating system. We will also suggest a metadata model which gives the information of all the related terms required for vulnerability assessment. Here, analyzing data is extracted from Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD).	0.4
Liquid in a Petri dish spontaneously circulates in a radial pattern, even when the dish is at rest. These fluid flows have been observed and utilized for biological research, but their origins have not been well-studied. Here, particle-tracking to measure velocities of radial fluid flows, which are shown to be linked to evaporation, is used. Infrared thermal imagnn was used to identify thermal gradients at the air -liquid interface and at the bottom of the dish. Two-color ratiometric confocal imaging was used to measure thermal gradients in the vertical direction within the fluid. A. finite-element model of the fluid, incorporating the measured temperature profiles, shows that buoyancy forces are sufficient to produce flows consistent with the measured particle velocity results. Such flows may arise in other dish or plate formats, and may impact biological research in positive or negative ways. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical. Engineers	3.4

Our process scheduling algorithm was created with the help of circular linked list and skip ring data structures and algorithms. Skip ring data structure consists of circular link lists formed in layers which are linked in a canonical way. Time complexity of search, insertion and deletion equals to O (lgN) in an N-element skip ring data structure. Therefore, skip ring data structure is employed more effectively (O(lgN)) in circumstances where circular linked lists (O(N)) are used. In this paper, the applications of data structures such as red-black tree, binary search tree and skip ring were performed and the obtained results were compared. The obtained results demonstrated that skip ring data structure is superior to red-black tree and binary search tree. Process scheduling is the most important part of operating systems. Linux operating system (version 6.23) uses Completely Fair Scheduler for process scheduling by using red-black tree data structures, Whereas skip ring data structure can be used effectively instead of red-black tree data structure. A new algorithm for process scheduling which was called as Fair Priority Scheduling was proposed in this paper.	0.4
Cooperative relationships between groups are difficult because of the high human capability to differentiate between in-group vs. out-group members. This obstacle exists even when the groups can obtain benefits for themselves from cooperation with other groups (rational cooperation). Based on an interactionist approach, the authors propose that personal (individual differences) and situational (conflicts) factors contribute to rational intergroup cooperation. The authors conducted a preliminary correlational study (Study 1) and an experimental investigation (Study 2). In Study 1, the authors examined, with 105 participants, the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI), measuring individual differences in information processing. In Study 2, the authors conducted an experimental investigation with 141 participants, testing the role of individual differences and conflict in intergroup rational cooperation. Findings of Study 1 showed that the scale has adequate psychometric properties. Results of Study 2 confirmed that the existence of both manipulated and perceived intergroup conflict reduces the magnitudes of the relationships between rational ability and rational cooperation. In addition, perceived intergroup conflict increased the magnitude of the links from experiential ability and experimental engagement to rational cooperation. Both individual differences and previous conflict have a role in predicting rational intergroup cooperation. According to the interactionist approach, personal and situational factors should be considered in the understanding of intergroup relationships.	2.0
Objective. The aim was to assess the characteristics of PsA, find out how well the disease is controlled in real life, demonstrate the treatments and identify the unmet needs. Methods. The PsA registry of Turkey is a multicentre Web-based registry established in 2014 and including 32 rheumatology centres. Detailed data regarding demographics for skin and joint disease, disease activity assessments and treatment choices were collected. Results. One thousand and eighty-one patients (64.7% women) with a mean (S.D.) PsA duration of 5.8 (6.7) years were enrolled. The most frequent type of PsA was polyarticular [437 (40.5%)], followed by oligoarticular [407 (37.7%)] and axial disease [372 (34.4%)]. The mean (S.D.) swollen and tender joint counts were 1.7 (3) and 3.6 (4.8), respectively. Of these patients, 38.6% were on conventional synthetic DMARD monotherapy, 7.1% were on anti-TNF monotherapy, and 22.5% were using anti-TNF plus conventional synthetic DMARD combinations. According to DAS28, 86 (12.4%) patients had high and 105 (15.2%) had moderate disease activity. Low disease activity was achieved in 317 (45.7%) patients, and 185 (26.7%) were in remission. Minimal disease activity data could be calculated in 247 patients, 105 of whom (42.5%) had minimal disease activity. The major differences among sexes were that women were older and had less frequent axial disease, more fatigue, higher HAQ scores and less remission. Conclusion. The PsA registry of Turkey had similarities with previously published registries, supporting its external validity. The finding that women had more fatigue and worse functioning as well as the high percentage of active disease state highlight the unmet need in treatment of PsA.	5.3
For more than 40 years, the uncanny valley model has captivated researchers from various fields of expertise. Still, explanations as to why slightly imperfect human-like characters can evoke feelings of eeriness remain the subject of controversy. Many experiments exploring the phenomenon have emphasized specific visual factors in connection to evolutionary psychological theories or an underlying categorization conflict. More recently, studies have also shifted away focus from the appearance of human-like entities, instead exploring their mental capabilities as basis for observers' discomfort. In order to advance this perspective, we introduced 92 participants to a virtual reality (VR) chat program and presented them with two digital characters engaged in an emotional and empathic dialogue. Using the same prerecorded 3D scene, we manipulated the perceived control type of the depicted characters (human controlled avatars vs. computer-controlled agents), as well as their alleged level of autonomy (scripted vs. self-directed actions). Statistical analyses revealed that participants experienced significantly stronger eeriness if they perceived the empathic characters to be autonomous artificial intelligences. As human likeness and attractiveness ratings did not result in significant group differences, we present our results as evidence for an uncanny valley of mind that relies on the attribution of emotions and social cognition to non-human entities. A possible relationship to the philosophy of anthropocentrism and its threat to human distinctiveness concept is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	2.1
Electrophysiologic studies suggest that autism spectrum disorder is characterized by aberrant anatomic and functional neural circuitry. During normal brain development, pruning and synaptogenesis facilitate ongoing changes in both short- and long-range neural wiring. In developmental disorders such as autism, this process may be perturbed and lead to abnormal neural connectivity. Careful analysis of electrophysiologic connectivity patterns using EEG coherence may provide a way to probe the resulting differences in neurological function between people with and without autism. There is general consensus that electroencephalogram coherence patterns differ between individuals with and without autism spectrum disorders; however, the exact nature of the differences and their clinical significance remain unclear. Here we review recent literature comparing electroencephalogram coherence patterns between patients with autism spectrum disorders or at high risk for autism and their non-autistic or low-risk for autism peers.	2.1
This paper describes an environment to assess auditory emotional recognition based on a mobile application. The primary aim of this work is to provide a valuable instrument that can be used both in research and clinical settings, responding to the strong need of validated measures of emotional processing, especially in Portugal. The secondary aim is to acquire and study the participants' interaction behavior with the technological device (e.g. touch patterns, touch intensity), in search for a relationship with medical conditions, cognitive impairments, auditory emotional recognition capacities or socio-demographic indicators. This will establish the basis for the prediction of such aspects as a function of an individual's interaction with technological devices, potentially providing new diagnostic tools.	4.0
Factors that promote healthy relationships have been understudied. The objective of this study is to examine mother-child verbal and nonverbal communication (separately), relationship quality and children's positive social behaviours in an at-risk sample framed within the developmental psychopathology approach. Mothers are part of a 35-year longitudinal prospective study who, as children, were rated by peers on measures of aggression and social withdrawal. These mothers, with their own 9- to 13-year-old children, participated in conflict and game-playing tasks. Verbal and nonverbal communication were coded separately using systematic observational measures. Maternal childhood histories of aggression and withdrawal predicted poorer dyad verbal communication, relationship quality and children's positive social behaviours. Frequently displayed positive verbal and nonverbal communication were associated with better relationship quality and children's positive social behaviours. The results highlight the unique contributions of verbal and nonverbal communication to adaptive development and to promoting healthy relationships in at-risk families during middle-childhood.	2.3
The ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting (RFRH) system collecting runoff by the plastic mulched ridges is a useful method to improve crop productivity in northwest China. We performed a field study where the RFRH system was combined with irrigation (RI) to reduce water irrigation use and to increase the crop water use efficiency (WUE) in a semi-humid climate. The amount of irrigation using RI was reduced by half compared with traditional furrow irrigation (FI) and border irrigation (BI) due to its rainwater harvesting effects. Our results showed that the RI treatment effectively alleviated drought stress during key periods of crop growth. At the jointing stage, the soil water storage in the 0-200 cm soil layer was increased by 2.82-8.02% and 2.25-8.40% compared with Fl and BI, respectively, and the soil water consumption by maize below 60 cm was significantly decreased at the tasselling stage. With RI, the harvest biomass, grain yield, and WUE were significantly increased by 14.59-19.93%, 5.33-7.01%, and 12.21-18.01% compared with Fl, respectively, and compared with BI, these values were significantly increased by 24.48-27.25%, 8.83-11.23%, and 14.99-22.91%, respectively. The irrigation amount was reduced by 1500 m(3) hm(-2), and the irrigation WUE with RI was 2.1 and 2.2 times higher than that using Fl and BI. The irrigation water productivity was improved by 1.71 and 5.70 times compared with Fl and BI, respectively in 2011. These results suggest that combining the RFRH system with irrigation is suitable for reducing irrigation water use by enhancing the efficient utilization of local rainfall, which could have very important applications in irrigated fields in semi-humid or semi-arid areas.

This review attempts to put together the sequential pathogenesis of VHL mutant metastatic ccRCC with links between driver pathways, epigenetics, biochemistry and immune evasion, with a translational perspective. We reflect on the gap between our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and currently accepted standard of care in metastatic RCC, and present ideas to bridge the gap with better translational research.Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for 80% of all RCC, and biallelic Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene defects occur in 75% of sporadic ccRCC. The etiopathogenesis of VHL mutant metastatic RCC, based on our understanding to date of molecular mechanisms involved, is a sequence of events which can be grouped under the following: (i) loss of VHL activity (germline/somatic mutation + inactivation of the wild-type copy); (ii) constitutive activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway due to loss of VHL activity and transcription of genes involved in angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis, survival, anaerobic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway; (iii) interactions of the HIF pathway with other oncogenic pathways; (iv) genome-wide epigenetic changes (potentially driven by an overactive HIF pathway) and the influence of epigenetics on various oncogenic, apoptotic, cell cycle regulatory and mismatch repair pathways (inhibition of multiple tumor suppressor genes); (v) immune evasion, at least partially caused by changes in the epigenome. These mechanisms interact throughout the pathogenesis and progression of disease, and also confer chemoresistance and radioresistance, making it one of the most difficult metastatic cancers to treat. This article puts together the sequential pathogenesis of VHL mutant ccRCC by elaborating these mechanisms and the interplay of oncogenic pathways, epigenetics, metabolism and immune evasion, with a perspective on potential therapeutic strategies. We reflect on the huge gap between our understanding of the molecular biology and currently accepted standard of care in metastatic ccRCC, and present ideas for better translational research involving therapeutic strategies with combinatorial drug approach, targeting different aspects of the pathogenesis.	6.0
VERA-CS (Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications, Core Simulator) is a coupled neutron transport and thermal-hydraulics code under development by the Conscirtium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL). An approach to uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis with VERA-CS was developed and a new toolkit was created to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. A 2 x 2 fuel assembly model was developed and Simulated by VERA-CS, and uncertainty quantification and Sensitivity analysis were performed with fourteen uncertain. input parameters. The minimum departure from nucleate boiling ratio (MDNBR), maximum fuel center-line temperature, and maximum outer clad surface temperature were chosen as the selected figures of merit. Pearson, Spearman, and partial correlation coefficients were considered for all of the figures of merit in sensitivity analysis and coolant inlet temperature was consistently the most influential parameter. Parameters used as inputs to the critical heat flux calculation with the W-3 correlation were shown to be the most influential on the MDNBR, maximum fuel center-line temperature, and maximum outer clad surface temperature.

This paper describes a variable output voltage, multi-phase switched capacitor step-up DC-DC converter with a digital voltage regulation scheme, implemented in CMOS VLSI technology. The number of conversion ratios generated using n flying capacitors is of the order of 2(n). A scheme for selection of switch is presented. Expressions for equivalent series resistance (Req), conduction, switching power loss and efficiency are obtained and compared with the cadence spectre simulation results. The step-up open loop converter circuit for one of the gain is described and analysed by varying the switching frequency. An open loop converter efficiency of about 78% is achieved with 4% bottom plate parasitic capacitance for a load current of 1 mA and input voltage of 0.6 V at 4 MHz of switching frequency for a gain of 4/3. The voltage regulation scheme for a desired output voltage is designed with a digital control circuit using inherent capacitive DAC which can interpolate through various gain configuration for n = 2 flying capacitor and is simulated in Cadence Analog-Mixed Signal Flow using 180nm CMOS technology. The layout design using MIM cap has been done and back annotation results are presented.	1.4
Objectives: The current paper aimed to explore doctor-patients' views about their treatment from the Practitioner Health Programme (PHP), a UK-based service treating health professionals with mental health/addiction problems. Aims were to gain insights into the issues most important to patients and consider whether a service specifically for doctors is important in helping to overcome barriers to accessing mental healthcare.Methods: Nine doctor-patients attending PHP took part in semi-structured interviews between September 2010 and June 2011. Thematic analysis was used to explore recurring patterns in the data. 134 written comments from PHP patients were also included.Results: Participants reported difficulties in finding appropriate treatment; problems were often severe by the time PHP was involved. Concerns about confidentiality, judgement and impact on career were obstacles to help-seeking and important issues during treatment. Analysis of written comments provided further support for these findings.Conclusion: Whilst some of the needs of mentally unwell doctors mirror the needs of patients in general - e.g. a supportive and non-judgemental attitude from clinicians - they do have specific needs related to confidentiality and stigma.	5.0
Problem: Can stimulation of nerve growth factors by focused transcranial extracorporeal shock waves (TESW) for persons within unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (apallic syndrome) be made effective? Patients and Methods: Five patients with apallic syndrome of differing severity received 7-17 years after their accident on average 4.4 4 week physicomedical complex treatment series including focused extracorporeal shock waves (device Duolith Storz Medical) for the spastic muscles. After this an enhancement of the vigilance could not be seen. Then these complex therapies were augmented by transcranial focused extracorporal shock waves (TESW). During 2-4 years the same patients received on average 5.2 TESW. Before and after the treatment series the patients were tested with the German Coma remission scale (CRS) and the German scale Expressive Communication and Self Actualisation (SEKS, Ziegler). Results: The patients improved their abilities by 135.9% on the CRS and by 81.7% on SEKS. Three PEG feeding tubes could be removed, nonverbal communication initiated 4 times. Discussion: Possible mode of actions and relation to other non invasive methods of brain stimulation are discussed. Conclusion: TESW seem to stimulate vigilance and the motoric in patients with apallic syndrome. A possible placebo effect and the neurophysiological must be verified.	2.3
One of the most important challenges of the creation of intelligent environments is the specifications of what intelligent behaviours the system will exhibit. The processing of these situations can be computationally demanding. We report on the advances of the specification of a rule-based language which allows for the natural expression of situations of interest as those which occur on Intelligent Environments. The language focuses on quasi real-time situations and includes new temporal operators which allow a natural reference to time instants and to intervals. We explained how the system is implemented and how the system was validated within a Smart Office scenario.	4.0
The inherent property of antibodies. binding to their antigen with high specificity makes them a strong candidate for sensing and detection applications. Microscale patterning of antibodies is desired for the miniaturization of sensors and fundamental cell biology studies. However, existing methodologies to pattern antibodies at the microscale are multi-step. In this work, we demonstrate microscale patterning of antibodies on a glass coverslip in a single step photolithography process. The microscale features of the photoresist were generated on the coverslip using photolithography, and the antibody solution was incubated. Acetone lift-off of the antibody incubated photoresist, and subsequent washing by isopropanol (IPA), produced a micro-array of antibodies. The functionality of patterned primary antibody was confirmed using the corresponding antigen and strict controls. One of the striking features of this method of patterning is that the process steps and chemicals inherently improve the adhesion between the. antibodies and glass without the need to functionalize the glass surface. We performed an ultrasonication test, detergent washing test, and Scotch. tape test to show improved adhesion. Using appropriate controls, we show that the interaction taking place between the antibodies and the glass surface, after our process, is stronger than the simple physisorption taking place between the. antibodies and the. glass surface, without any treatment.	6.1
This study clarified factors affecting the increase in jump distance when the novice increased the number of steps in their approach run in the long jump, and discusses a training task designed to improve performance in the long jump. Twenty-eight male students who were novices in long jump and did not take part in any sport activity regularly participated in the study. They performed the long jump with run-ups of six and twelve strides. The take-off motions of the participants were captured with a high-speed digital camera (120 fps) for two-dimensional motion analysis. When students increased the number of steps in their approach run, the jump distance and approach velocity increased, horizontal deceleration during the take-off phase remained almost unchanged, and the vertical velocity at take-off and the contact time decreased. The change rate of the jump distance between six and twelve steps for the approach run had positive correlation with the change rates of the approach velocity and vertical velocity and negative correlation with the change rate of the contact time. In a previous study using athletes as participants, all athletes increased their jump distance as they increased the number of steps in their approach run. In the present study, however, many students did not increase their jump distance, and the change rate of the jump distance had a wide distribution. Therefore, we divided the students into groups according to whether the participant's change rate of the jump distance was lower or higher than the average change rate for all participants. Although both groups had increased horizontal velocity at touchdown for the lengthened run-up, participants in the low group did not increase their jump distance and their vertical velocity at take-off decreased. Additionally, in comparison with athletes, students had lower vertical velocity at take-off and horizontal deceleration during take-off. A novice should thus learn the proper technique of take-off to generate vertical velocity through horizontal deceleration. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The high-dimensional data space generated by hyperspectral sensors introduces challenges for the conventional data analysis techniques. Popular dimensionality reduction techniques usually assume a Gaussian distribution, which may not be in accordance with real life. Metric learning methods, which explore the global data structure of the labeled training samples, have proved to be very efficient in hyperspectral fields. However, we can go further by utilizing locally adaptive decision constraints for the labeled training samples per class to obtain an even better performance. In this paper, we present the locally adaptive dimensionality reduction metric learning (LADRml) method for hyperspectral image classification. The aims of the presented method are: 1) first, to utilize the limited training samples to reduce the dimensionality of data without a certain distribution hypothesis; and 2) second, to better handle data with complex distributions by the use of locally adaptive decision constraints, which can assess the similarity between a pair of samples based on the distance changes before and after metric learning. The experimental results obtained with a number of challenging hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the proposed LADRml algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction and metric learning methods.	4.2
DNA-based individual identification and RNA-based tissue identification represent two commonly-used tools in forensic investigation, aiming to identify crime scene sample donors and helping to provide links between DNA-identified sample donors and criminal acts. Currently however, both analyses are typically performed separately. In this proof-of-principle study, we developed an approach for the simultaneous analysis of forensic STRs, amelogenin, and forensic mRNAs based on parallel targeted DNA/RNA sequencing using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (R) (PGM (TM)) System coupled with the AmpliSeq (TM) targeted amplification. We demonstrated that 9 autosomal STRs commonly used for individual identification (CSF1PO, D16S539, D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, TH01, TPOX, and vWA), the AMELX/AMELY system widely applied for sex identification, and 12 mRNA markers previously established for forensic tissue identification (ALAS2 and SPTB for peripheral blood, MMP10 and MMP11 for menstrual blood, HTN3 and STATH for saliva, PRM1 and TGM4 for semen, CYP2B7P1 and MUC4 for vaginal secretion, CCL27 and LCE1C for skin) together with two candidate reference mRNA markers (HPRT1 and SDHA) can all be successfully combined. Unambiguous mRNA-based tissue identification was achieved in all samples from all forensically relevant tissues tested, and STR sequencing analysis of the tissue sample donors was 100% concordant with conventional STR profiling using a commercial kit. Successful STR analysis was obtained from 1 ng of genomic DNA and mRNA analysis from 10 ng total RNA; however, sensitivity limits were not investigated in this proof-of-principle study and are expected to be much lower. Since dried materials with noticeable RNA degradation and small DNA/RNA amplicons with high-coverage sequencing were used, the achieved correct individual and tissue identification demonstrates the suitability of this approach for analyzing degraded materials in future forensic applications. Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously obtaining multilocus STR, amelogenin, and multilocus mRNA information for combined individual and tissue identification from a small sample of degraded biological material. Moreover, our study marks the first step towards combining many DNA/RNA markers for various forensic purposes to increase the effectiveness of molecular forensic analysis and to allow more forensically relevant information to be obtained from limited forensic material.

In recent years, the validity of embolism quantification methods has been questioned, especially for long-vesseled plants. Some studies have suggested that cutting xylem while under tension, even under water, might generate artificial cavitation. Accordingly, a rehydration procedure prior to hydraulic measurements has been recommended to avoid this artefact. On the other hand, concerns have been raised that xylem refilling might occur when samples are rehydrated. Here, we explore the potential biases affecting embolism quantification for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) petioles harvested under tension or after xylem relaxation. We employ direct visualization of embolism through X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) to test for the occurrence of fast refilling (artifactually low per cent loss of conductivity (PLC) due to rehydration prior to sample harvest) as well as excision-induced embolism (artifactually high embolism due to air introduction during harvest). Additionally, we compared the response functions of both stomatal regulation and xylem embolism to xylem pressure (I-x). Short-time (20aEuro...min) xylem tension relaxation prior to the hydraulic measurement resulted in a lower degree of embolism than found in samples harvested under native tensions, and yielded xylem vulnerability curves similar to the ones obtained using direct microCT visualization. Much longer periods of hydration (overnight) were required before xylem refilling was observed to occur. In field-grown vines, over 85% of stomatal closure occurred at less negative I-x than that required to induce 12% PLC. Our results demonstrate that relaxation of xylem tension prior to hydraulic measurement allows for the reliable quantification of native embolism in grapevine petioles. Furthermore, we find that stomatal regulation is sufficiently conservative to avoid transpiration-induced cavitation. These results suggest that grapevines have evolved a strategy of cavitation resistance, rather than one of cavitation tolerance (diurnal cycles of embolism and repair).	3.1
From an ecological perspective, the nature of rainwater harvesting with the characteristics of artificial disturbance is a manual disturbance. So it is very important to confirm the degree of ecological disturbance that occurs due to rainwater harvesting. Drawing from ecological disturbance theory, we can utilize both the distance method and dynamic curve method to estimate the level of ecological disturbance and degree of rainwater harvesting with a historical reference point value of the environment as a frame of reference, and with the 20 indicators such as surface runoff and evaluation index. Our examples show that the distance method and dynamic curve method are feasible for evaluating the ecological disturbance degree of rainwater harvesting. There are also research-scale effects in the study of ecological disturbance of rainwater harvesting that embody the comparability of different spatial and temporal ecological disturbance degrees. The comparability of ecological disturbance degrees of rainwater harvesting in an area at different scales or in different areas at the same scales is not strong, but it also generates some useful reference values. The ecological disturbance measurement in the same study area and at the same research-scale at different historical periods can be compared.	4.3
Purpose of review Endometrial cancer incidence is increasing in North America and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. We review recent literature published on treatment of endometrial cancer and highlight areas of active interest. Recent findings There has been movement toward minimal invasive surgery at diagnosis; lymph node staging remains controversial and continues to be investigated. Progress has been made to establish consensus on endometrial cancer risk classification to promote consistency for future trial design. Molecular characterization of endometrial cancer and its integration into clinicopathological profiling to develop predictive biomarkers for treatment selection are active areas of research. Optimal adjuvant treatment strategy in high-risk endometrial cancer remains to be defined with recognition of treatment-related toxicity. Despite encouraging results in drug development for treatment of advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer, no targeted therapies beyond hormonal therapy are approved. There is an urgent need for scientifically validated therapy with predictive biomarkers. Summary Our understanding of endometrial cancer has evolved through improvements in molecular biology, allowing improved definition of target-specific therapies. The precise role and sequence of conventional and targeted therapies, including immunotherapy, will require careful attention to the design of clinical trials with translational emphasis to allow the discovery, validation, and implementation of predictive biomarkers into clinical care.	6.0
Chronic exposure to cocaine in vivo induces long-term synaptic plasticity associated with the brain's circuitry that underlies development of repetitive and automatic behaviors called habits. In fact, prolonged drug consumption results in aberrant expression of protein-coding genes and small regulatory RNAs, including miRNAs that are involved in synaptic plasticity and neuroadaptations. However, the mechanisms mediating cocaine use disorder are still not fully understood. The present study is designed to examine the expression of miR-124, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-212, as well as the levels of the Ago2, Pum2, and REST mRNAs and proteins implicated in their regulation. We applied rat cocaine self-administration (SA) and extinction training procedures with a yoked triad to assess the changes in the levels of four miRNAs and three protein-coding genes and corresponding proteins in the dorsal striatum. We demonstrated that elevated expression of mature miR-212 and miR-132 is long-lasting and persists in the drug-free period (till 10-day abstinence). Moreover, mRNA and protein of REST, a regulator of neuronal transcription, was raised selectively in cocaine self-administering rats and Ago2 transcript decreased after cocaine treatment. Unexpectedly, the expression level of Ago2 and Pum2 proteins changed only in the active cocaine-receiving animals. These results point out the important aspects of long-lasting alterations in microRNAs, genes, and protein expressions involved in the control of synaptic plasticity associated with reward and motivation learning related to cocaine addiction.	5.0
A variety of studies on food sharing elucidate both its ultimate and proximate functions in non-human primates, especially in Pan. For chimpanzees, food sharing serves as a means to strengthen social relationships. In contrast, little is known about food sharing in orangutans, since their semi-solitary lifestyle barely provides an opportunity to share food outside of the mother-offspring context. However, recent long-term studies suggest that social bonding might play a more important role for orangutans than previously assumed. In zoos, orangutans are often kept in groups and seem to cope with group living quite well. If captive orangutans use food sharing as a social tool, they are expected to share food frequently and selectively with close social partners and to engage frequently in active transfers. We provided three orangutan groups with monopolizable food and recorded all dyadic food-related interactions. For each dyad, we determined the relationship quality and tested whether it predicts food sharing. We found that, in support of our predictions, almost two thirds of interactions involving food resulted in sharing and that the probability for an individual to share food with a particular partner increased with the strength of their relationship. Exceeding our expectations, food sharing occurred even between individuals from two neighboring groups. Finally, a comparison with studies on captive chimpanzees revealed a significantly higher proportion of active transfers for orangutans suggesting species-specific sharing psychologies. Sharing of food is a universal prosocial behavior in humans. Recent research aims to elucidate its adaptive functions and proximate mechanisms by comparison with other species, especially non-human primates, in natural and captive settings. For bonobos and chimpanzees, our closest relatives, the quality of social relationships was revealed to be important for food sharing. In contrast, there is very limited knowledge on food sharing in orangutans, our most distant and semi-solitary living hominid relatives. This study provides the first systematic investigation of food-sharing patterns and the role of relationship quality in captive orangutans. The results demonstrate that group-living orangutans share frequently and selectively with close associates and even more actively than found for chimpanzees. These findings add further evidence supporting the hypothesis that social bonding played a role in the evolution of human prosocial behavior.	2.4
A high-resolution drought forecast model for ungauged areas was developed in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1-6-month lead times at 0.05 x 0.05 degrees resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer's accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user's accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that incorporates a diverse range of things such as sensors, actuators, and services deployed by different organizations and individuals to support a variety of applications. The information captured by IoT present an unprecedented opportunity to solve large-scale problems in those application domains to deliver services; example applications include precision agriculture, environment monitoring, smart health, smart manufacturing, and smart cities. Like all other Internet based services in the past, IoT-based services are also being developed and deployed without security consideration. By nature, IoT devices and services are vulnerable tomalicious cyber threats as they cannot be given the same protection that is received by enterprise services within an enterprise perimeter. While IoT services will play an important role in our daily life resulting in improved productivity and quality of life, the trend has also encouraged cyber-exploitation and evolution and diversification of malicious cyber threats. Hence, there is a need for coordinated efforts from the research community to address resulting concerns, such as those presented in this special section. Several potential research topics are also identified in this special section.	0.2
During the past earthquake, the liquefaction phenomenon of saturated sand mixture has been the cause of severe damage to various buildings and other structures. The catastrophic nature of this type of failure obliged to build a structure on geosynthetics will be used to reinforce the soil and improve its mechanical properties. Reinforcing elements in the form of layers or sheets of waste materials in soil is important because of their use in practical civil engineering and geotechnical applications. The main advantages of such materials are they are locally available, inexpensive, and recyclable. Waste plastics have been successfully used as reinforcement in soil to improve shear strength parameters and the stiffness modulus. This paper focuses on the behavior of plastic reinforcement in sand under triaxial monotonic drained conditions. Laboratory triaxial compression tests were carried out to determine stress and strain, volumetric change behavior, and shear strength parameters and to estimate the strength ratio at various strain levels in sand reinforced with plastic layers. The test involved one to five plastic layers that were placed at regular vertical spacings within the sand. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of plastic layers increases the maximum deviator stress, shear strength parameters and ductility, with the maximum increase corresponding to the five layers of plastic. The inclusion of plastic layers reduces dilation and increases the strength ratio, with the percent increase being greater at higher strain levels. The lower secant modulus was measured in the unreinforced and reinforced sand, with the latter exhibiting higher values of secant modulus at axial strains of 1 % that tend to stabilize for higher values of axial strain.	4.1
The Presentation Trainer is a multimodal tool designed to support the practice of public speaking skills, by giving the user real-time feedback about different aspects of her nonverbal communication. It tracks the user's voice and body to interpret her current performance. Based on this performance the Presentation Trainer selects the type of intervention that will be presented as feedback to the user. This feedback mechanism has been designed taking in consideration the results from previous studies that show how difficult it is for learners to perceive and correctly interpret real-time feedback while practicing their speeches. In this paper we present the user experience evaluation of participants who used the Presentation Trainer to practice for an elevator pitch, showing that the feedback provided by the Presentation Trainer has a significant influence on learning.	2.3
This research described U.S. adults' beliefs about nicotine and low nicotine cigarettes (LNCs) using the nationally-representative Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS-FDA 2015; N = 3738). About three quarters of people either were unsure of the relationship between nicotine and cancer or incorrectly believed that nicotine causes cancer. People who were non-White, less educated, age 65+, and never established smokers were most likely to be unaware that nicotine is not a cause of cancer. More than a quarter of people held the potentially inaccurate beliefs that LNCs would be less harmful and addictive than typical cigarettes. Whites were more likely than Blacks to believe LNCs were less harmful than typical cigarettes, and never smokers were more likely to believe this than established quitters. Whites and people with at least a college degree were more likely to believe that LNCs would be less addictive than typical cigarettes. Overall, we found that many people, particularly the demographic subgroups identified here, held incorrect beliefs about nicotine and potentially inaccurate beliefs about LNCs. Findings should be considered in assessing the public health impact of marketing low nicotine products. Incorrectly believing that nicotine causes cancer could discourage smokers from switching to safer nicotine-containing alternatives, and could lead nonsmokers to experiment with low nicotine tobacco products, believing that cancer risk would be reduced. Findings underscore the need to educate the public on the health effects of nicotine and LNCs, and can help public health practitioners determine which subgroups should be prioritized in targeted educational efforts.

Background: Substance use disorder (SUD) is an important health problem that requires a complex range of care because of the chronic nature of the disorder and the multiple psychosocial problems involved. Current outpatient programs often have difficulties in delivering and coordinating ongoing care and access to different healthcare providers. Various case management (CM) models have been developed, first for patients in other psychiatric domains and then for patients with SUD, in order to improve treatment outcomes. Aim: This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of CM for patients with SUD. Methods: We performed a systematic review of CM interventions for patients with SUD by analyzing randomized controlled studies published on the subject between 1996 and 2016 found on the electronic database PubMed. Results and conclusion: Fourteen studies were included in the analysis. Differences between studies in outcome measures, populations included, and intervention characteristics made it difficult to compare results. Most of these studies reported improvement in some of the chosen outcomes. Treatment adherence mostly improved, but substance use was reported to decrease in only a third of the studies. Overall functioning improved in about half of the studies. The heterogeneity of the results might be linked to these differences between studies. Further research is needed in the field.	5.0
This article explores how Canadian youth who participate in Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality. Participants' perspectives on, definitions of, and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities. For GSA members, bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy. Despite these distinctions, both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility, mis/understandings, and prejudice in school. Findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity wasmore nuanced than their GSA advisors due to personal online research. GSA participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers, and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities. Although GSA involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities, this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs.	2.0
Podcasts are digital files very popular in several and very distinct areas. In higher education, they have been explored in a multitude of ways mainly to support teaching and learning processes. The study here described focuses the integration of podcasts in Heredity and Evolution, a course from the Biology and Geology Degree Program at University of Minho, Portugal. It aimed to introduce podcasts in the teaching/learning context, to empirically study different dimensions of podcasting, and to evaluate students' acceptance and receptiveness to the pedagogical use of this technology. Five informative podcasts and three with feedback were produced and delivered. All the students listened to the audio files and considered the episodes audible and clear, their preference going to episodes of short or moderate length and containing summaries, study guidelines or syllabus contents. Students judged extremely valuable the integration of this technology in learning and showed receptiveness to podcasting in other courses. Curiously, in spite of owning mobile devices, students clearly favored the use of personal computers to listen to the podcasts. This student acceptance and openness to podcasting has been encouraging its pedagogical application in other teaching courses. The episodes produced often maintain the characteristics identified as the best by the students of this study but the pedagogical approach has been moving to a more student-centered learning situation, with students as podcasts producers.

Estimation of the draft requirement of tillage implements is important from machine design, and tractor selection viewpoints. In this study, a model was developed to calculate the draft force and power of a disk plow. In this model, the effects of soil cutting, soil displacement, and soil-metal friction processes on the specific draft force of a disk plow were considered. Model inputs consisted of the soil parameters, the plow parameters, and the working condition parameters. To simplify the required calculations, the derived equations were entered in the Excel software, and the finalized spreadsheet was utilized as the disk plow draft force and power calculator. One of the advantages of the developed model was that the required calculations did not depend upon the dimensionless N-factors. Model verification was carried out by comparing the model outputs with the corresponding results of other studies. Moreover, the output of the model and the measured draft force of plowing on a silty clay loam soil were compared. According to the results of this study, the form of equation developed in this paper and the Hendrick's formula regarding the specific draft force, were compatible, since both equations were polynomials of order 2 with respect to the forward velocity of the plow. On the other hand, the developed model overestimated the required draft force of a disk blade in comparison with the Godwin's model; however, the average value of overestimation was only 18%. Moreover, draft force and power requirements of a three-blade disk plow working on a silty clay loam soil with the forward velocity of 7 km h(-1), were 11.3 kN, and 22 kW, respectively, that were about 5% lower than the results obtained by the developed model (11.8 kN, and 22.95 kW). Therefore, the developed model can be used to calculate the disk plow draft force and power with reasonable accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.3
This paper presents an optimization formulation for designing residential water networks involving harvested rainwater and reclaimed wastewater. The design problem is posed as a multi-objective optimization formulation that seeks to balance the objectives of total annualized cost, fresh water consumption, and environmental impact. A life cycle assessment approach is undertaken for estimating the environmental impact. The seasonal dependence of the rainwater is considered in the optimization model. The design approach is applied to a case study for the city of Morelia in Mexico. The results show that significant economic, fresh water consumption, and environmental benefits can be obtained as a result of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.3
Increasing evidence suggests that pain-related fear is key to the transition from acute to chronic pain. Previous research has shown that perceptual similarity with a pain-associated movement fosters the generalization of fear to novel movements. Perceptual generalization of pain-related fear is adaptive as it enables individuals to extrapolate the threat value of one movement to another without the necessity to learn anew. However, excessive spreading of fear to safe movements may become maladaptive and may lead to sustained anxiety, dysfunctional avoidance behaviors, and severe disability. A hallmark of human cognition is the ability to extract conceptual knowledge from a learning episode as well. Although this conceptual pathway may be important to understand fear generalization in chronic pain, research on this topic is lacking. We investigated acquisition and generalization of concept-based pain-related fear. During acquisition, unique exemplars of one action category (CS+; e.g., opening boxes) were followed by pain, whereas exemplars of another action category (CS-; e.g., closing boxes) were not. Subsequently, spreading of pain-related fear to novel exemplars of both action categories was tested. Participants learned to expect the pain to occur and reported more pain-related fear to the exemplars of the CS+ category compared with those of the CS- category. During generalization, fear and expectancy generalized to novel exemplars of the CS+ category, but not to the CS- category. This pattern was not corroborated in the eyeblink startle measures. This is the first study that demonstrates that pain-related fear can be acquired and generalized based on conceptual knowledge.	5.4
Excessive Internet use in adolescents and young people is related to intrapersonal and interpersonal difficulties. The aim of this research was to study the relationship between problematic Internet use, psychological well-being, and responses of social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive. Participants were 132 male and 178 female high school and college students aged between 16 and 23 years. The results indicate that age influences most of the factors of compulsive Internet use. Gender affects the levels of problematic Internet use, with males scoring higher in Compulsive Internet Use and Negative Outcomes. A significant and direct correlation was found between problematic Internet use and responses of social anxiety and obsessive-compulsive. The main predictors of problematic Internet use were: Environmental mastery, Social anxiety and Obsessive-compulsive symptoms. It can be concluded, tentatively, that while young people with social anxiety could find the Internet use a means of pleasant interaction, young people with obsessive-compulsive symptoms could become excessive Internet users as a means to eliminate compulsive anxiety.	5.0
Background Musculoskeletal involvement is extremely common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Continuing the research initiated in patients with inflammatory arthritis, recent studies have shown the potential role of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) in the evaluation of clinical and subclinical lupus synovitis. The inflammatory process in SLE is traditionally considered to be localized at synovial tissue areas while enthesis is not included among the possible targets of the disease. Patients and methods Entheses included in the Glasgow Ultrasound Enthesitis Scoring System were scanned in a cohort of 20 SLE patients serving as disease controls in an MSUS study aimed at assessing enthesitis in patients with psoriatic arthritis. We describe in detail four cases with unexpected and unequivocal expressions of MSUS enthesitis according to the OMERACT definition. Three out of four patients had no predisposing factors for enthesopathy. Case no. 2 was treated with a variable-dose prednisone regimen. Results In the four cases MSUS examination revealed relevant grey-scale and power Doppler abnormalities at the entheseal level, most commonly at the distal insertion of the patellar tendon. Signs of clinical enthesitis were detected in only one patient. Conclusions This case series shows for the first time the presence of clearly evident MSUS findings indicative of enthesitis in four out of 20 SLE patients (20%), raising the hypothesis that enthesis could be a missing target in the clinical evaluation of SLE patients. Our case series justifies further investigations for a better evaluation of the prevalence, characteristics and clinical relevance of entheseal involvement in SLE.	5.3
The great number of heterogeneous interconnected operating systems gives greater access to intruders and makes it easier for malicious users to break systems security policy. Also, a single security control agent is insufficient to monitor multiple interconnected hosts and to protect distributed operating systems from hostile uses. This paper shows the ability of distributed security controller's agents to correlate data stream from heterogeneous hosts and to trace abnormal behavior in order to protect network security. An experimental study is done to improve our proposed approach.	0.2
Light Emitting Diode (LED) luminaires provide compelling benefits such as long-term cost savings, and safety advantages through longer life and durability. LED luminaires have lower maintenance costs, and improved instant restrike capability when compared to legacy luminaire types. In industrial applications, the proven lower total cost of ownership and increased safety for LEDs are the driving forces for LED luminaires to replace traditional light sources. As with any new technology, challenges exist in designing and maintaining an optimal system to withstand the intended application and environmental conditions. Common challenges and considerations include luminaire placement, the intensity/dispersion/quality of light, thermal management, material selection, and redundant safety and operating systems. The authors will examine best practices and common misconceptions in the selection and application of LED luminaires focusing on process and harsh/hazardous locations. The probability of success in maximizing reliability, safety & efficiency of LED technology in such applications is enhanced by utilizing proven design principles & methods. The selection methods and design principles will be explained using actual application examples and case studies.	0.4
This research characterized the vibration responses of cement pavement surface slabs atop different interlayers under a moving vehicle load via the laboratory simulated vibration response tests and the field tests. This was done with the help of a micro-seismic monitoring system. In the laboratory simulated vibration response tests, a 4.5 kg hammer was used to impose impact loading, while geotextile and rubber sheet were used as the interlayers. The laboratory test results indicated that under the same impact load, compared with the surface slabs without an interlayer beneath, the vector sum of the peak vibration velocity of the surface slabs atop the rubber sheet interlayer, the single-layered geotextile interlayer, and the double-layered geotextile interlayer decreased by 68, 56, and 67 %, respectively; the vector sum of their maximum displacement amplitude decreased by 96, 52, and 45 %, respectively. In the field tests for vibration response, which were done under an estimated vehicle loading 60 t (rear axle loading 30 t) and an estimated vehicle speed of 60 km/h, the surface slabs with geotextile or plastic membrane as the interlayer beneath were tested. The field test results indicated that under the same other conditions, compared with the surface slabs without an interlayer beneath, the vector sum of the peak vibration velocity of the surface slabs atop the interlayer of a double-layered geotextile plus a single-layered plastic membrane, the interlayer of a single-layered geotextile plus a single-layered plastic membrane, and the interlayer of a single-layered plastic membrane decreased by 53, 46, and 10 %, respectively. The vector sum of their maximum displacement amplitude decreased by 41, 39, and 19 %, respectively. To conclude, the rubber sheet interlayers and the geotextile interlayers can help the cement pavement surface slabs significantly damp the vibrations caused by the moving vehicle load or the impact load.	4.1
Negative symptoms have long been conceptualized as a core aspect of schizophrenia. They play a key role in the functional outcome of the disorder, and their management represents a significant unmet need. Improvements in definition, characterization, assessment instruments and experimental models are needed in order to foster research aimed at developing effective interventions. A consensus has recently been reached on the following aspects: a) five constructs should be considered as negative symptoms, i.e. blunted affect, alogia, anhedonia, asociality and avolition; b) for each construct, symptoms due to identifiable factors, such as medication effects, psychotic symptoms or depression, should be distinguished from those regarded as primary; c) the five constructs cluster in two factors, one including blunted affect and alogia and the other consisting of anhedonia, avolition and asociality. In this paper, for each construct, we report the current definition; highlight differences among the main assessment instruments; illustrate quantitative measures, if available, and their relationship with the evaluations based on rating scales; and describe correlates as well as experimental models. We conclude that: a) the assessment of the negative symptom dimension has recently improved, but even current expert consensus-based instruments diverge on several aspects; b) the use of objective measures might contribute to overcome uncertainties about the reliability of rating scales, but these measures require further investigation and validation; c) the boundaries with other illness components, in particular neurocognition and social cognition, are not well defined; and d) without further reducing the heterogeneity within the negative symptom dimension, attempts to develop successful interventions are likely to lead to great efforts paid back by small rewards.	2.1
Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based studies have become increasingly common in the investigation of GPCR signaling. Our research group developed an intra-molecular FRET sensor to detect the interaction between Ga subunits and GPCRs in live cells following agonist stimulation. Here, we detail the protocol for detecting changes in FRET between the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and the Gas C-terminus peptide upon treatment with 100 mu M isoproterenol hydrochloride as previously characterized1. Our FRET sensor is a single polypeptide consisting serially of a full-length GPCR, a FRET acceptor fluorophore (mCitrine), an ER/K SPASM (systematic protein affinity strength modulation) linker, a FRET donor fluorophore (mCerulean), and a Ga C-terminal peptide. This protocol will detail cell preparation, transfection conditions, equipment setup, assay execution, and data analysis. This experimental design detects small changes in FRET indicative of proteinprotein interactions, and can also be used to compare the strength of interaction across ligands and GPCR-G protein pairings. To enhance the signal-to-noise in our measurements, this protocol requires heightened precision in all steps, and is presented here to enable reproducible execution.	6.0
A double-sided liquid cooling Nd: YAG disk oscillator working at a pump repetition rate of 20 Hz is demonstrated. The output energy of 376 mJ is realized, corresponding to the opticaloptical efficiency of 12.8% and the slope efficiency of 14%. The pump pulse width is 300 mu s and the laser pulse width is 260 mu s. Instead of being a damped signal, the output of laser comprises undamped spikes. A periodic intra-cavity loss was found by numerical analysis, which has a frequency component near the eigen frequency of the relaxation oscillation. Resonance effect will induce amplified spikes even though the loss fluctuates in a small range. The Shark-Hartmann sensor was used to investigate the wavefront aberration induced by turbulent flow and temperature gradient. According to the wavefront and fluid mechanics analysis, it is considered that the periodic intra-cavity loss can be attributed to turbulent flow and temperature gradient.	3.4
Objective: This preliminary study examines the effects of low-dose light therapy, also called Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, on epithelial colony forming units (eCFUs) in epithelial cells from skin and mucosa to assess their potential to contribute to tissue regeneration. Also, preliminary comparison of basic PBM parameters such as wavelengths, light sources, and dose were evaluated in promoting eCFUs. Background Data: Regenerative medicine is at the brink of exploiting the tremendous potential offered by advances in stem cell biology. The two distinct aspects for utilization of stem cells, either resident (endogenous) or transplanted (exogenous), rely on cells amenable to expansion and being directed toward mature, functional tissues. Despite major progress in fundamental understanding of stem cell pluripotency, there remain fundamental challenges in applying these insights into clinical practice. Methods: PBM treatments with various devices, wavelengths, and doses were used on two epithelial cell lines and colony forming assays were performed. Results: This study noted a dose-dependent effect of 810 nm laser on increasing eCFUs, either in terms of size or numbers. Comparisons of different wavelengths and light sources noted better efficacy of collimated and coherent lasers compared to LEDs and broad-band light. Conclusions: PBM therapy promotes expansion of eCFUs that represent progenitors and stem cell populations capable of contributing to tissue repair and regeneration. Further exploration of the precise mechanisms would allow optimization of PBM clinical protocols to harness the regenerative potential of stem cells for wound healing and other clinical regenerative applications.	6.1
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are regarded as promising therapeutic agents to treat addiction. The current study aimed to examine the effects of huperzine A, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on behavioral sensitization induced by repeated morphine administration and relapse induced by contextual conditioning. The present study also assessed whether the state-dependency hypothesis may explain the results. Adult rats were divided into four groups (n=8) and intraperitoneally injected with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A or saline (1 ml/kg, control), for 5 days. The effect of repeated huperzine A administration alone on locomotor activity was assessed. For the experiments that analyzed the development of morphine-induced sensitization, 40 rats were divided into five groups (n=8): Saline+Saline, Saline+Morphine, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A+Morphine. Following a withdrawal period of 7 days, all animals were administered saline or morphine, as appropriate. To test the state-dependency hypothesis, the rats in the Saline+Morphine group were injected with saline and morphine, while the other three groups were administered different doses of huperzine A and morphine. To examine the effect of huperzine A on the expression of morphine-induced sensitization, the rats in huperzine A+Morphine groups were injected with appropriate concentrations of huperzine A, and morphine. The current results indicated that the administration of huperzine A alone did not affect locomotor activity, while higher doses of huperzine A inhibited the addictive behavior induced by morphine at the development phase. Additionally, huperzine A administration during the expression phase of morphine sensitization did not inhibit the relapse induced by administration of saline. Furthermore, 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A inhibited the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Therefore, the results of the current study do not support the state-dependency hypothesis.	5.0
Finding meaning in life is a fundamental personal need, and motivating prosocial behavior is a fundamental societal need. The present research tests whether the two are connected - whether helping other people can increase helpers' perceptions of meaning in life. Evidence from a nationally representative data-set and two experiments support this hypothesis. Participants who engaged in prosocial behaviors - volunteering and spending money to benefit others - reported experiencing greater meaning in their lives (Studies 1-3). Study 3 also identifies increased self-worth as the mechanism - participants who spent money to benefit other people felt higher personal worth and self-esteem, and this mediated the effect of prosocial behavior on meaningfulness. The present results join other findings in suggesting that the incentives for helping others do not necessarily depend on the prospect of others' reciprocity. Prosocial behavior can be incentivized through the psychological benefits it creates for prosocial actors.	2.4
Water pollution incidents can cause rapid deterioration of water quality, potentially leading to the illness and death of surrounding residents. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the impact of water pollution incidents, and to understand the mechanisms of pollutant transport and transformation. To address this problem, this paper constructed a hydraulic water quality model for the lower reaches of the Xiangjiang River, China, using the hydrodynamic module and convective diffusion module of MIKE21. Six pollution incident scenarios were simulated to investigate the transport process of pollutants, as affected by an upstream dam structure, the Changsha Comprehensive Control Project dam (CCCP). Analysis of the results suggests that the CCCP plays an essential role in controlling the transport and transformation of pollutants. With the CCCP, the process of transport is weakened, and the dispersion effect is strengthened. In particular, after the construction of the CCCP, the same amount of upstream discharge leads to lower peak pollutant concentrations and longer pollutant arrival times to each waterworks' intake, thereby alleviating the impact of water pollution incidents. Further, comparative analysis suggests that the role of CCCP is much more significant with lower discharges (e. g., during the dry season), largely due to the higher amount of water quantity within the reach.	4.4
In regions lacking socio-economic data, pairing satellite imagery with participatory information is essential for accurate land-use/cover (LULC) change assessments. At the village scale in Papua New Guinea we compare swidden LULC classifications using remote sensing analyses alone and analyses that combine participatory information and remotely sensed data. These participatory remote sensing (PRS) methods include participatory land-use mapping, household surveys, and validation of image analysis in combination with remotely sensed data. The classifications of the swidden area made using only remote sensing analysis show swidden areas are, on average, two and a half times larger than land managers reported for 1999 and 2011. Classifications made using only remote sensing analysis are homogeneous and lack discrimination among swidden plots, fallow land, and non-swidden vegetation. The information derived from PRS methods allows us to amend the remote sensing analysis and as a result swidden areas are more similar to actual swidden area found when ground-truthing. We conclude that PRS methods are needed to understand swidden system LULC complexities.	4.2
Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) are common for wastewater treatment in remote Canadian Arctic communities. In this paper, two geotextiles of different mass/unit areas are examined as a potential biofiltration upgrade to existing WSPs in arctic summer conditions. The intended role of the geotextile is to provide additional treatment of municipal wastewater seeping from these WSPs. Column filtration experiments were performed using municipal wastewater in a controlled laboratory environment at either 10 degrees C or 2 degrees C. The columns contained one of two different nonwoven geotextiles over 10 cm of gravel, simulating a WSP berm in contact with exfiltrating wastewater. Weekly wastewater samples were taken upstream and downstream of the geotextile/gravel filter and were analyzed for a suite of water quality parameters; the hydraulic conductivity of the columns was also measured weekly. Results showed that it is possible to accumulate biomass on geotextile material over a 3 month period at these temperatures, which corresponded with 1-2 log reductions in hydraulic conductivity. Significant removal of total suspended solids, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus was observed; however, removal efficiencies for most parameters were reduced at the lower temperature. This study demonstrates that geotextiles could be used to enhance the performance of WSP systems operating in arctic climates.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1
Despite their superficial localization in the skin, pathogenic dermatophytes can induce a complex but still misunderstood immune response in their hosts. The cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is correlated with both clinical recovery and protection against reinfection, and CD4+ T lymphocytes have been recognized as a crucial component of the immune defense against dermatophytes. Before the discovery of the Th17 pathway, CMI was considered to be only dependent of Th1 cells, and thus most studies on the immunology of dermatophytosis have focused on the Th1 pathway. Nevertheless, the fine comparative analysis of available scientific data on immunology of dermatophytosis in one hand and on the Th17 pathway mechanisms involved in opportunistic mucosal fungal infections in the other hand reveals that some key elements of the Th17 pathway can be activated by dermatophytes. Stimulation of the Th17 pathway could occur through the activation of some C-type lectin-like receptors and inflammasome in antigen-presenting cells. The Th17 cells could go back to the affected skin and by the production of signature cytokines could induce the effector mechanisms like the recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. In conclusion, besides the Th1 pathway, which is important to the immune response against dermatophytes, there are also growing evidences for the involvement of the Th17 pathway.	6.3
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a heart failure syndrome occurring late in pregnancy or during the early post-natal period. The pathophysiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy is not fully understood and various mechanisms have been postulated including an underlying inflammatory process. We here report four cases presenting with acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three out of four of the patients presented with a left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and one with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. All made a full clinical recovery following treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. This case series adds to the growing body of evidence for the role for immunosuppressants in the management of peripartum cardiomyopathy.	6.3
A recent initiative in Madhya Pradesh, India to promote privately funded, rainwater harvesting structures on farmers' own land has shown substantial economic and livelihood benefits. In contrast to the many poorly functioning, community managed rainwater harvesting programs, the individual or decentralized rainwater harvesting structures have led to significant improvements in availability of irrigation water, a revival of the agricultural economy of the region, and substantial increases in farmer incomes and livelihoods. Since 2006, more than 6000 farmers in the state have invested in on-farm ponds. The investments are highly cost effective and farmers are able to recover their initial investment in approximately 3 years. While longer-terms impact studies are needed, this initial assessment suggests that on-farm rainwater harvesting ponds are a promising private small irrigation option in Madhya Pradesh and similar regions in India and elsewhere.

Our success and well-being, as individuals and societies, depend on our ability to make wise social decisions about important interpersonal matters, such as the leaders we select and the individuals we choose to trust. Nevertheless, our impressions of people are shaped by their facial appearances and, consequently, so too are these social decisions. This article summarizes research linking facial morphological traits to important social outcomes and discusses various factors that moderate this relationship.	2.2
Negative attitudes are a major barrier to the equality of people with disabilities. Governments and other organizations have implemented numerous programmes to change attitudes towards people with disabilities. We analyse published evidence about the effectiveness of such programmes using a framework of the interrelationship among three levels of policy intervention to change attitudes: personal level directed at changing the attitudes of individuals; organizational level concerning attitudinal barriers in domains such as employment, education and health; and government level - legally mandating behaviour change. The analysis finds that the following policy types can be effective if used together: policies that involve direct contact with people with disability; information and awareness campaigns; education and training about disability; and antidiscrimination enforcement. Policy characteristics that contribute to effectiveness include a positive programme experience for participants; multifaceted and prolonged interventions; and adequate programme resources. Policy effectiveness to change attitudes relies on corresponding reinforcement at all three policy levels.	2.0
Urban stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding and natural water pollution. It is therefore important to assess any hydrologic trends in urban catchments for stormwater management and planning. This study addresses urban hydrological trend analysis by examining trends in variables that characterize hydrological processes. The original and modified Mann-Kendall methods are applied to trend detection in two French catchments, that is, Chassieu and La Lechere, based on approximately 1decade of data from local monitoring programs. In both catchments, no trend is found in the major hydrological process driver (i.e., rainfall variables), whereas increasing trends are detected in runoff flow rates. As a consequence, the runoff coefficients tend to increase during the study period, probably due to growing imperviousness with the local urbanization process. In addition, conceptual urban rainfall-runoff model parameters, which are identified via model calibration with an event based approach, are examined. Trend detection results indicate that there is no trend in the time of concentration in Chassieu, whereas a decreasing trend is present in La Lechere, which, however, needs to be validated with additional data. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the original Mann-Kendall method is not sensitive to a few noisy values in the data series.	4.4
In this paper, the stability issue of Lur'e systems governed by a control law stabilising their forward Euler approximate model is investigated. More specifically, the considered control law is obtained by exploiting the advantages of a new Lur'e type Lyapunov function with disconnected level sets. This Lyapunov function is adapted to discrete-time Lur'e systems and to the structure of the forward Euler approximate model. The main result consists of linear matrix inequality conditions allowing to guarantee that the continuous-time Lur'e system associated with the proposed digital control law is globally asymptotically stable. The relevance of this approach is illustrated using a numerical example.	1.4
Within this paper, a comparative approach will be presented, in order to evaluate electrical machines in electrical drive trains. The selection of the machine type is an essential task for the design of drive trains. This paper contains the comparison of induction machines and permanent magnet synchronous machines, whereas the comparison follows an abstract procedure, since almost no machine parameters are given. Therefore, assumptions are made in order to reduce the complexity of the machine design equations. Due to the concluding diagram, it becomes possible to get a first impression about the torque-current characteristic of both machine types. The characteristics are proved by parameters of commercial machines.	3.3
The paper describes the design for manufacturability of a prototype product as part of a manufacturing engineering capstone course. The product chosen was a vertically launched unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-the Flying Eye. The Flying Eye is an autonomous parafoil surveillance platform equipped with sensors, controllers, mechanical components, and software. Once the autonomous UAV is deployed, it is designed to follow a predetermined flight path down to the ground. The design effort of the prototype device took place over a three-year period as a collaborative effort between the Aerospace Engineering and Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering departments at California Polytechnic State University. This project proved to be an excellent tool for the project-based learning environment, which is the focus of Cal Poly's hands-on engineering programs. Details of the Flying Eye project and lessons learned during the course of this educational experience are provided.	3.2
The aim of this study was to investigate possible association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 9250 in exon 7 of the Osteopontin gehe (OPN gene 9250) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A case control association study was performed in 120 AS patients and 106 matched controls, consented to participate in the study. OPN gene 9250 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The frequency of the TC+CC genotype of the OPN gene 9250 was significantly higher (25.83% vs 12.26%, p < 0.05) and the frequency of C allele was significantly higher (17.50% vs 8.96%, p < 0.01) in AS patients than in controls. There were significant differences in OPN gene 9250 allele and phenotype frequencies between the AS patients and controls (p < 0.05). OPN gene 9250 polymorphism appears to be associated with susceptibility to AS in Chinese patients.	5.3
This paper studies how imposing norms on contribution behavior affects individuals' intrinsic motivation. We consider the church levy, which the Catholic Church in Germany collects as a charitable donation, despite the fact that the levy is legally a tax. We design a randomized field experiment with treatments informing individuals that the levy is a tax. We demonstrate that treatment effects differ across motivational types. Among weakly intrinsically motivated individuals, communicating the legal norm results in a significant crowd-out of intrinsic motivation. In contrast, strongly intrinsically motivated individuals do not show any treatment response. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	2.4
Background: Phenotyping is a critical component of plant research. Accurate and precise trait collection, when integrated with genetic tools, can greatly accelerate the rate of genetic gain in crop improvement. However, efficient and automatic phenotyping of traits across large populations is a challenge; which is further exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials. A promising approach is to leverage current advances in imaging technology, data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping and subsequent decision support. In this context, the workflow for phenotyping (image capture. data storage and curation ->trait extraction ->machine learning/classification ->models/apps for decision support) has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility. We illustrate such an end- to- end phenotyping workflow for the case of plant stress severity phenotyping in soybean, with a specific focus on the rapid and automatic assessment of iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) severity on thousands of field plots. We showcase this analytics framework by extracting IDC features from a set of similar to 4500 unique canopies representing a diverse germplasm base that have different levels of IDC, and subsequently training a variety of classification models to predict plant stress severity. The best classifier is then deployed as a smartphone app for rapid and real time severity rating in the field. Results: We investigated 10 different classification approaches, with the best classifier being a hierarchical classifier with a mean per-class accuracy of similar to 96%. We construct a phenotypically meaningful ' population canopy graph', connecting the automatically extracted canopy trait features with plant stress severity rating. We incorporated this image capture ->image processing ->classification workflow into a smartphone app that enables automated real-time evaluation of IDC scores using digital images of the canopy. Conclusion: We expect this high-throughput framework to help increase the rate of genetic gain by providing a robust extendable framework for other abiotic and biotic stresses. We further envision this workflow embedded onto a high throughput phenotyping ground vehicle and unmanned aerial system that will allow real-time, automated stress trait detection and quantification for plant research, breeding and stress scouting applications.	0.1
Background: Across cancers, the decision to pursue genetic testing is influenced more by subjective than objective factors. However, skin cancer, which is more prevalent, visual, and multifactorial than many other malignancies, may offer different motivations for pursuing such testing. Objectives: The primary objective was to determine factors influencing the decision to receive genetic testing for skin cancer risk. A secondary objective was to assess the impact of priming with health questions on the decision to receive testing. Methods: We distributed anonymous online surveys through ResearchMatch.org to assess participant health, demographics, motivations, and interest in pursuing genetic testing for skin cancer risk. Two surveys with identical questions but different question ordering were used to assess the secondary objective. Results: We received 3783 responses (64% response rate), and 85.8% desired testing. Subjective factors, including curiosity, perceptions of skin cancer, and anxiety, were the most statistically significant determinants of the decision to pursue testing (P < . 001), followed by history of sun exposure (odds ratio 1.85, P < . 01) and history of skin cancer (odds ratio 0.5, P = .01). Age and family history of skin cancer did not influence this decision. Participants increasingly chose testing if first queried about health behaviors (P < .0001). Limitations: The decision to pursue hypothetical testing may differ from in-clinic decision-making. Self-selected, online participants may differ from the general population. Surveys may be subject to response bias. Conclusion: The decision to pursue genetic testing for skin cancer is primarily determined by subjective factors, such as anxiety and curiosity. Health factors, including skin cancer history, also influenced decision-making. Priming with consideration of objective health factors can increase the desire to pursue testing.	5.4
Securing the networks of large organizations is technically challenging due to the complex configurations and constraints. Managing these networks requires rigorous and comprehensive analysis tools. A network administrator needs to identify vulnerable configurations, as well as tools for hardening the networks. Such networks usually have dynamic and fluidic structures, thus one may have incomplete information about the connectivity and availability of hosts. In this paper, we address the problem of statically performing a rigorous assessment of a set of network security defense strategies with the goal of reducing the probability of a successful large-scale attack in a dynamically changing and complex network architecture. We describe a probabilistic graph model and algorithms for analyzing the security of complex networks with the ultimate goal of reducing the probability of successful attacks. Our model naturally utilizes a scalable state-of-the-art optimization technique called sequential linear programming that is extensively applied and studied in various engineering problems. In comparison to related solutions on attack graphs, our probabilistic model provides mechanisms for expressing uncertainties in network configurations, which is not reported elsewhere. We have performed comprehensive experimental validation with real-world network configuration data of a sizable organization.	0.2
The sudden impact of a free surface flow upon a solid wall is a common occurrence in many situations in nature and technology. The design of marine structures is probably the most obvious example, but also river and dam hydraulics as well as the necessity of understanding flood and debris flow-induced damage have led to theoretical and experimental work on the mechanism of fluid slamming loads. This is therefore a very old and rich research field, which has not yet reached full maturity, so that semi-empirical methods in design practice are still the rule in many sectors. Up-to-date CFD technology with both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches is employed to investigate highly non-stationary fluid impact on a solid wall. The development of the pressure wave produced by the impact is examined as it propagates and interacts with the fluid boundaries, as well as the subsequent build-up of high-pressure gradients of high fluid velocities. The geometry and the velocity field of the problem considered are very simple, but the results seem to provide new insight, in particular, into the connection between phenomena with different timescales.	3.1
Whereas a number of studies have examined relationships among brain activity, social cognitive skills, and autistic traits, fewer studies have evaluated whether structural connections among brain regions relate to these traits and skills. Uncinate fasciculus (UF) and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) are white matter tracts that may underpin the behavioral expression of these skills because they connect regions within or provide sensory information to brain areas implicated in social cognition, and structural differences in these tracts have been associated with autistic traits. We examined relationships among self-reported autistic traits, mentalizing, and water diffusivity in UF and ILF in a nonclinical sample of 24 young adults (mean age = 21.92 years, SD = 4.72 years; 15 women). We measured autistic traits using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, and we measured mentalizing using the Dynamic Interactive Shapes Clips task. We used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics and randomize to examine relationships among fractional anisotropy (FA) values in bilateral ILF and UF, age, cognitive abilities, autistic traits, and mentalizing. Autistic traits were positively related to FA values in left ILF. No other relationships between FA values and other variables were significant. Results suggest that left ILF may be involved in the expression of autistic traits in individuals without clinical diagnoses.	2.1
Despite international efforts, stigma is still a significant issue for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This paper explores the stigma encountered in health interactions, focusing on strategies PLWHA use to manage and reduce it. It is hoped that our findings will improve future interactions by contributing towards a more understanding practitioner-patient relationship. The data have been drawn from a small qualitative study conducted in Christchurch, New Zealand. Fourteen participants took part in semi-structured face-to-face interviews in 2013 and 11 of these participants were then interviewed again in 2014. Codes and themes were developed through inductive thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. Our findings identified that whilst the majority of participants had positive experiences, nearly all had faced stigma during their health interactions. Most of these encounters were due to healthcare workers holding exaggerated fears of transmission or not maintaining confidentiality and privacy. The main way that participants managed this stigma was through seeking control in their interactions. This overarching strategy could be further divided into three key themes: selective disclosure of their HIV status, self-advocacy and developing their HIV knowledge. We discuss these findings in the context of the current literature, comparing our results to strategies that have been previously identified in social settings.	2.0
In this study, based on attribute and password, we introduce a new kind of two-factor authentication protocol that has various applications such as anonymous authentication and privacy protection. Specifically, our proposal is constructed by introducing password authentication into the generic framework of attribute-based authentication. Consequently, it not only achieves two-factor authentication, but also enjoys the advantages of attribute authentication and password authentication simultaneously. Furthermore, to formally evaluate the security of the proposed protocol, we present the corresponding security model, within which the detailed security proof of the proposal is given.

In the paper a possibility of using a metrology micro computed tomography (CT) to assess quality of parts made by rapid prototyping technique was presented. Additive manufacturing techniques dramatically change the approach to manufacturing process. Not long ago they allowed solely for obtaining a spatial model of a part in order to visualize its features. Nowadays, it is possible to produce elements and assembly groups with properties that make it possible to replace many parts manufactured using traditional casting or injection techniques. Polymer components created by means of 3D printing can be generated one layer of material after another. In many cases inner spaces (sections) are not fully filled in (solid), they are rather replaced by a specially selected structure. Thanks to this it is possible to save material and reduce weight. To control these structures and to inspect joints between particular layers using a non-destructive method it is necessary to use a metrology micro CT. In the paper an application of X-ray computed tomography and assessment of measurement uncertainty regarding elements manufactured with fused deposition modeling (FDM) method using ABS 3D printing on UP! printer was presented. Inspection of both: inner structure and outer shapes as well as joints between them was performed basing on computer aided design (CAD) model.	3.0
A wide array of social decisions relies on social comparisons. As such, these decisions require fast access to relative information. Therefore, we expect that signatures of the comparative process should be observable in electrophysiological components at an early stage of information processing. However, to date, little is known about the neural time course of social target comparisons. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis in 2 electroencephalography (EEG) studies using a social distance effect paradigm. The distance effect capitalizes on the fact that stimuli close on a certain dimension take longer to compare than stimuli clearly differing on this dimension. Here, we manipulated the distance of face characteristics regarding their levels of attractiveness (Study 1) and trustworthiness (Study 2), 2 essential social dimensions. In both studies, size comparisons served as a nonsocial control condition. In Study 1, distance related effects were apparent 170 ms (vertex positive potential, VPP) and 200 ms (N2) after stimulus onset for attractiveness comparisons. In Study 2, trustworthiness comparisons took effect already after 100 ms (N1) and likewise carried over to an event-related N2. Remarkably, we observed a similar temporal pattern for social (attractiveness, trustworthiness) and nonsocial (size) dimensions. These results speak in favor of an early encoding of comparative information and emphasize the primary role of comparison in social information processing.	2.2
Background: Recent epidemiologic studies have revealed a significant association between periodontitis and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Furthermore, periodontitis is markedly associated with orodigestive cancer mortality, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) infection has been identified as a specific and potentially independent microbial factor related to increased risk of orodigestive cancer death. The authors previously reported that Pg induced the precursor form of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9) production via proteinase-activated receptor (PAR)-related pathways, after which proMMP-9 was activated by gingipains to enhance cellular invasion of SAS cells. In the present study, effects of selected polyphenols as inhibitors of cellular invasion caused by Pg gingipains in SAS cells are examined. Methods: OSCC cells were infected with Pg strains including gingipain mutants. To evaluate effects of inhibitors: 1) apple polyphenol (AP); 2) hop bract polyphenol (HBP); 3) high-molecular-weight fractions of HBP (HMW-HBP); 4) low-molecular-weight fractions of HBP (LMW-HBP); 5) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg); 6) KYT-1 (Arg-gingipain inhibitor); and KYT-36 (Lys-gingipain inhibitor) in combination are used. PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA expressions are examined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and signaling pathways are evaluated by western blotting analysis. Results: KYT-1/KYT-36, AP, HBP, and HMW-HBP significantly inhibited PAR2 and PAR4 mRNA expressions, proMMP-9 activation, and cellular invasion. Furthermore, AP, HBP, and HMW-HBP reduced activation of heat shock protein 27 and Ets1 and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B, whereas EGCg and LMW-HBP did not. Conclusion: These results suggest that AP, HBP, HMW-HBP are potent inhibitors of proMMP-9 activation and cellular invasion mediated with Pg in OSCC cells.	6.1
A 5-bit digital controlled switch-type passive phase shifter realised in a 40 nm digital CMOS technology without ultra-thick metals for the 60 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band is presented. A patterned shielding with electromagnetic bandgap structure and a stacked metals method to increase the on-chip inductor quality factor are proposed. To reduce the insertion loss from the transistors, the transistor switches are implemented with a body-source connection. For all 32 states, the minimum phase error is 1.5 degrees, and the maximum phase error is 6.8 degrees. The measured insertion loss is -20.9 +/- 1 dB including pad loss at 60 GHz and the return loss is >10 dB over 57-64 GHz. The total chip size is 0.24 mm(2) with 0 mW DC power consumption.	1.4
Residence times and connectivity are computed for 12 subregions in an urban man-made lake in China using a high-resolution tracer-transport model. The renewal timescales are explicitly defined and computed for two groups of four freshwater inflow scenarios related to water diversion projects. First, the timescale values are computed and compared using different computational criteria for the upper limit of integration in the residence time equation. The sensitivity analysis suggests that a calculation time of 300 days is necessary to satisfy the relative error (0.001) and 5 % cutoff value criteria. Secondly, the residence times can range from 1.5 to 102 and 1.0 to 66 days under low and high flow conditions, respectively. Water in the inner lake would reside in the lake for less than 66 days prior to exiting the region of interest. The timescale values can be applied to impact studies that investigate the extent of sudden water pollution events that initially affect a subdomain of a lake. Finally, the lacustrine residence times are decomposed into the different subregion residence times, resulting in a connectivity matrix. This matrix can illustrate preferential connections among the individual subregions and reveal hidden patterns relating to local hydrodynamics in the lake.	4.4
Purpose - This paper aims to explore the feasibility of rapid prototyping for human hand bones and additional artery with topological preservation. Design/methodology/approach - A serial of slices derived from spiral computed tomography human hand specimen was imported into 3DSlicer 4.4.0 to obtain a three-dimensional virtual model. The model is exported as a standard template library file. Additional arteries were structured according to the atlas and the bone model. Then, a real model was printed based on the virtual model. Measurements were approached in 11 parts of the virtual and real model. Findings - There is no statistical difference between virtual and real model in 11 parts, and the topological characters were preserved. Practical implications - This method can be used in reconstruction of clinical iconological blood vessel and anatomical education. Originality/value - This paper shows that it is possible to keep the topological structure of blood vessel not only in painting but also in clinical data.	3.0
The acceptance of tung oil enriched diet and the incorporation of conjugated linolenic acid - CLnA into fillets of Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) were investigated. The diet was well accepted, and after 10 days CLnA was incorporated into the fillets with a 1.02% content of total fatty acids (FA). In addition, biosynthesis of the conjugated linoleic acid isomers - CLA (0.31% of fillet total FA content) from CLnA, and the presence of alpha-linolenic acid - LNA (1.08% of fillet total FA content), eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA (2.85% of fillet total FA content) and docosahexaenoic acid - DHA (3.08% of fillet total FA content) were observed. Therefore, the consumption of this fish can increase the intake of different FA (CLnA, CLA, LNA, EPA and DHA), which play an important role in human metabolism.	6.2
Introduction: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and its incidence is increasing at an alarming rate all over the world. The pathophysiology of AD is characterized by chronic, progressive neurodegeneration which involves early synaptotoxicity. One of the most obvious pathological feature of AD is the accumulation of amyloid- (A) in the brain. Since current treatment options only provide symptomatic help and A is thought to underlie early synaptic pathology, A reduction or modulation in the brain may be a promising therapeutic strategy in preventing and /or reversing AD-related dysfunction.Areas covered: This paper outlines and evaluates the current landscape of preclinical and clinical studies focusing on modulating A pathophysiology. Data and analysis for this review were procured from PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov and Alzforum.Expert opinion: According to current knowledge, reducing A production offers numerous treatment options. However, targeting the initial steps by pharmacological interference with secretases is challenging due to the emergence of various side effects. The most promising approach seems to be the prevention of early A oligomerization. Combination approaches targeting both A and tau would seem to be another promising strategy that could have beneficial effects through the course of the disease.	5.2
Purpose Kyrieleis retinal periarteritis reflects the severe intraocular inflammation experienced by the eye. Its aetiology has not been well established, since only nine cases have been reported and there is no pathological study available in the literature. We determine the pathogenesis of Kyrieleis periarteritis based on interpretation of multimodal imaging findings. Methods Charts of patients with Kyrieleis arteritis seen between 2006 and 2014 were retrieved from eight uveitis referral centres throughout the world. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 12months. Results Twenty-five eyes with Kyrieleis arteritis from 25 patients were included in the study. Nineteen patients (72%) were male and six (28%) were female. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis and two patients had cytomegalovirus retinitis. Fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence and indocyanine green angiography were performed on 25/25 (100%) eyes. In eight eyes (32%), baseline spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans were performed along the segmental Kyrieleis arteritis. Fluorescein angiography showed early hypofluorescence and intermediate hyperfluorescence associated with the areas of focal arteritis, whereas indocyanine green angiography of these accumulations showed early hypofluorescence and late hyperfluorescence. Fundus autofluorescence revealed an increased autofluorescence of the vessels corresponding to the Kyrieleis plaques, while SD-OCT scans along the segmental Kyrieleis arteritis showed hyperreflectivity of the vessel wall. Conclusions These imaging modalities provide in vivo, quasi-histologic images demonstrating that Kyrieleis plaques are characterised by an inflammatory involvement within the vessels' endothelium.	6.3
In this research, an application algorithm, which can be used in computer-aided design/engineering (CAD/CAE) and structural optimisation-based design studies of agricultural machineries, is introduced. This developed algorithm has been put in practice in a case study for a tractor mounted telescopic boom crane. The algorithm consists of both numerical and experimental methods and it includes material testing, three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design and finite-element method (FEM)-based analysis procedures, structural optimisation strategy, physical prototyping, physical testing and design validation procedures. Following the visual and physical validation procedures carried out in the case study, the crane's physical prototype was manufactured and the optimised design was approved for ongoing production. The study provides a unique CAD/CAE and experimentally driven total design pathway for similar products, which contributes to further research into the utilisation of engineering simulation technology for agricultural machinery design, analysis and related manufacturing subjects.	3.0
In a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important. We present results from a comprehensive investigation of cross-societal cooperation in one-shot prisoner's dilemmas involving population-representative samples from six countries and identify crucial facilitators of and obstacles to cooperation. In interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players' nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants' cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner's nationality. In the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations.	2.4
This paper presents an investment feasibility analysis of rainwater harvesting systems for the residential sector in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. Five towns were selected for the analysis. Daily rainfall data, average water consumption, rainwater tank costs, water pump costs, and water, sewage and electricity tariffs were obtained for the five towns. Different values for the roof area, number of residents, potable water demand, and rainwater demand were analysed. The rainwater tank capacities were estimated using the Netuno computer programme. The investment feasibility analysis was performed considering the ideal lower tank capacity, as well as capacities smaller and larger than the ideal. Such capacities were obtained according to a variation of six months in the payback period. It was observed that the ideal tank capacity can be conservative for high rainwater demands. In such cases, an investment feasibility analysis should be performed in order to obtain a more appropriate tank capacity. The main conclusion is that rainwater usage is economically feasible for most cases; and the higher the rainwater demand, the higher the feasibility.	4.3
In many digital control systems, it is required to perform computation in a strictly periodic fashion to provide high control performance. System designers need to assign time slots that are infinitely repeated given a strict period for each task such that the time slots of different tasks do not overlap. While previous work has studied how to decide if a system is schedulable with a certain time slot assignment, it is still an unexplored area of how to select time slots for strictly periodic tasks to make them schedulable. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to solve the above problem. Our method explores the relations among task periods to improve the possibility of finding feasible start time configurations. Finally, we conduct experiments with randomly generated workload to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1.4
ObjectivesInterpersonal dysfunction is central to borderline personality disorder (BPD). Recent research has focused on the role of oxytocin (OT) in BPD, particularly regarding associations of OT activity with symptoms, genetic polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor coding gene (OXTR) in BPD, and experimental modification of interpersonal core problems of patients with BPD such as hypervigilance towards threat detection, mistrust, and non-verbal behaviour during social interaction by intranasal application of OT. MethodsA literature (medline') review was performed using the keywords oxytocin' and borderline personality disorder'. Secondary literature on trauma and attachment in relation to OT was also considered relevant. ResultsTogether, findings suggest that in BPD OT is associated with enhanced defensive mechanisms and avoidance behaviour. Moreover, gene-environment interaction concerning polymorphic variations of the OXTR gene and childhood adversity in BPD suggests that these genes convey developmental flexibility or differential susceptibility' to environmental contingencies, whereby BPD resides at the poor outcome end of the spectrum. ConclusionsIn view of the conflicting literature, it needs to be studied carefully whether OT can serve as a therapeutic agent given adjunct to psychotherapy in BPD. More research about the role of OT is also required with regard to the prevention of the non-genetic intergenerational transmission of BPD. Clarifying the role of OT in BPD may also benefit from research in non-human animals targeting the interaction between early adversity and OT availability more directly. Practitioner points The study of oxytocin can contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology of borderline personality disorder. Oxytocin is critically involved in attachment security, and methylation of the oxytocin receptor may play a role in the epigenetic modulation of early adversity. The intranasal application of oxytocin may be a useful therapeutic adjunct to psychotherapy. Insecure attachment and childhood adversity may produce differential neurobiological effects on the oxytocinergic system in borderline personality disorder. There is insufficient knowledge of how oxytocin interacts with vasopressin, testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin, which are also important key players in the experience of social reward and stress responsivity. It is unclear whether or not oxytocin could be beneficial in preventing the intergenerational (non-genetic) transmission of borderline personality traits.	2.4
The use of polyacrylamide (PAM)-based flocculants has become an essential component of most geotextile tube dewatering projects. Although knowledge of the residual flocculant concentration in geotextile tube supernatant and effluent is essential to the safe use of PAM-based flocculants, residual flocculant concentration is not commonly measured in geotextile tube dewatering operations. Furthermore, there is no ASTM standard test method for measuring residual flocculant concentrations in water. This paper presents a comparative study of two different methods that are commonly used to measure residual flocculant concentrations in water: the Streaming Current Detection (SCD) method and the China Clay Settling Rate (CCSR) method, to evaluate their applicability to the geotextile tube industry. The comparison is based on an analysis of measured residual PAM concentrations obtained for five different cationic PAM polymers used to flocculate Tully fines soil. Optimum flocculant doses for the Tully fines soil were determined using the jar test (ASTM D2035-08) for three different solids concentrations by mass (5, 15, and 33 %). The SCD and CCSR methods were performed on the supernatants of Tully fines that were conditioned at their optimum doses and at concentrations 50 % above their optimum dose. Laboratory test results showed that both the SCD and CCSR methods produced similar residual PAM concentration results for the polymer/soil combinations tested. The SCD method, however, produced more consistent and repeatable results in comparison to the CCSR method. The SCD method was also easier to use and could be performed in shorter amounts of time than the CCSR method. Based on the results, it is recommended that the SCD method be standardized and used to measure residual PAM-based flocculant concentrations in geotextile tube supernatant and effluent.	4.1
Purpose of review Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have remarkably diverse somatic mutation patterns that can be challenging to interpret clinically. Yet, genetic information is increasingly available to physicians. This review will examine several implications of genetic diversity in MDS. Recent findings Somatic mutations can serve as clinically relevant biomarkers in MDS. Molecular subtypes may exist that share clinical features including risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, response to treatment, and overall survival. Several mutated genes are known to have prognostic value that is independent of common risk stratification tools. Mutations of several genes identify low-blast percentage patients with greater than predicted disease risk while only SF3B1 mutations predict lower disease risk than expected. Mutations of TP53 are associated with adverse features, yet demonstrate inferior outcomes than predicted by these risk factors. SF3B1 and TP53 mutations may identify clinically relevant subtypes of MDS and allow for better refinement of risk within these groups. Using somatic mutations to diagnose MDS is more challenging because they can occur in healthy individuals. Yet, patients with unexplained cytopenias have a high rate of clonal hematopoiesis that may be an important risk factor to identify clinically. Summary Patterns of somatic mutations are diverse in MDS, but can inform the prediction of prognosis and aid in its diagnosis.	6.4
Analytical treatment of a linear elastic isotropic bi-material full-space reinforced by an interfacial thin film under axisymmetric normal loading is addressed. The thin film is modeled as an extensible membrane perfectly bonded to the half-spaces. By virtue of Love's potential function and Hankel integral transform, elastic fields of the system are explicitly written in the form of semi-infinite line integrals. The analytical results are verified by the special cases corresponding to the surface stiffened half-space and classical bi-material problem. The limiting cases of reinforced homogeneous full-space and inextensible membrane are presented and discussed. The proposed formulation is also applicable for studying reinforced auxetic materials with negative Poisson's ratio. The surface/interface effect on the elastic responses of two perfectly bonded half-spaces is also simulated by assigning equivalent surface elastic constant to the membrane stiffness. Effects of thin film stiffness, material properties, loading depth, and surface/interface effect are studied by some numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1
A design of a new hybrid-type digital pulsewidth modulator (DPWM) with a wide frequency range of 1000 : 1, from 10 kHz to 10 MHz, is presented. The proposed DPWM has the maximum duty-cycle resolution of 11 bits and consumes the power of 17.5 mu W at 10 kHz and 2.36 mW at 10 MHz, respectively. The proposed DPWM realizes the upper 5-bit resolution using a programmable digital counter and the lower 6-bit resolution using a current-integrating-type phase interpolator, employing an M2M-ladder current-steering digital-to-analog converter for low power consumption. The operating clock is generated in on-chip using a relaxation oscillator. The prototype integrated circuit fabricated in a 0.25-mu m high-voltage complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor demonstrates that the proposed DPWM maintains a good linearity across the entire operating range.	1.4
Unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), which are synthetic agonists of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), activate humoral and cellular immunity and are being developed as vaccine adjuvants to prevent or treat cancers, infectious diseases, and allergies. Free CpG ODNs have been used in many clinical trials implemented to verify their effects. However, recent research has reported that self-assembled CpG ODNs, protein/peptide-CpG ODN conjugates, and nanomaterial-CpG ODN complexes demonstrate higher adjuvant effects than free CpG ODNs, owing to their improved uptake efficiency into cells expressing TLR9. Moreover, protein/peptide-CpG ODN conjugates and nanomaterial-CpG ODN complexes are able to deliver CpG ODNs and antigens (or allergens) to the same types of cells, which enables a higher degree of prophylaxis or therapeutic effect. In this review, the author describes recent trends in the research and development of CpG ODN nanomedicines containing self-assembled CpG ODNs, protein/peptide-CpG ODN conjugates, and nanomaterial-CpG ODN complexes, focusing mainly on the results of preclinical and clinical studies.	5.1
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer among women and its incidence is increasing. Risk assessment is valuable and recent methods are incorporating novel biomarkers such as mammographic density. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are adaptive algorithms capable of performing pattern-to-pattern learning and are well suited for medical applications. They are potentially useful for calibrating full-field digital mammography (FFDM) for quantitative analysis. This study uses ANN modeling to estimate volumetric breast density (VBD) from FFDM on Japanese women with and without breast cancer. ANN calibration of VBD was performed using phantom data for one FFDM system. Mammograms of 46 Japanese women diagnosed with invasive carcinoma and 53 with negative findings were analyzed using ANN models learned. ANN-estimated VBD was validated against phantom data, compared intra-patient, with qualitative composition scoring, with MRI VBD, and inter-patient with classical risk factors of breast cancer as well as cancer status. Phantom validations reached an R (2) of 0.993. Intra-patient validations ranged from R (2) of 0.789 with VBD to 0.908 with breast volume. ANN VBD agreed well with BI-RADS scoring and MRI VBD with R (2) ranging from 0.665 with VBD to 0.852 with breast volume. VBD was significantly higher in women with cancer. Associations with age, BMI, menopause, and cancer status previously reported were also confirmed. ANN modeling appears to produce reasonable measures of mammographic density validated with phantoms, with existing measures of breast density, and with classical biomarkers of breast cancer. FFDM VBD is significantly higher in Japanese women with cancer.	0.1
In recent years, researchers have been trying to shed light on gaming addiction and its association with different psychiatric disorders and psychological determinants. The latest edition version of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) included in its Section 3 Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) as a condition for further empirical study and proposed nine criteria for the diagnosis of IGD. The 20-item Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD-20) Test was developed as a valid and reliable tool to assess gaming addiction based on the nine criteria set by the DSM-5. The aim of this study is to validate an Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test. The Arabic version of IGD-20 will not only help in identifying Arabic-speaking pathological gamers but also stimulate cross-cultural studies that could contribute to an area in need of more research for insight and treatment. After a process of translation and back-translation and with the participation of a sizable sample of Arabic-speaking adolescents, the present study conducted a psychometric validation of the IGD-20 Test. Our confirmatory factor analysis showed the validity of the Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test. The one-factor model of the Arabic IGD-20 Test had very good psychometric properties, and it fitted the sample data extremely well. In addition, correlation analysis between the IGD-20 Test and the daily duration on weekdays and weekends gameplay revealed significant positive relationships that warranted a criterion-related validation. Thus, the Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test is a valid and reliable measure of IGD among Arabic-speaking populations.	5.0
One of the main challenges of teaching statistics to engineering students is to convey the importance of being conscious of the presence of variability and of taking it into account when making technical and managerial decisions. Often, technical subjects are explained in an ideal and deterministic environment. This article shows the possibilities of simple electrical circuits-the Wheatstone Bridge among them-to explain to students how to characterize variability, how it is transmitted, and how it affects decisions. Additionally, they can be used to introduce the importance of robustness by showing that taking into account the variability of components allows the design of cheaper products with greater benefits than if one were to simply apply formulas that consider variables as exact values. The results are quite unexpected, and they arouse the interest and motivation of students. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.	1.2
In this paper, an adaptive synchronous rectifier (SR) driving scheme for the LLC resonant converters using the ripple counter concept is proposed, along with two methods of implementation. With the proposed scheme, the SR drain to source voltage is sensed to detect the body diode conduction, based on which the SR on-time can be well tuned to eliminate the body diode conduction. One proposed implementation tunes the SR on-time every switching cycle based on the ripple detection; another proposed implementation tunes the SR on-time every nth switching cycle (n = 1, 2, 3...) based on the ripple counter, which is suitable for the high frequency LLC converters. The proposed SR driving scheme has the simple implementation, requires only low-cost digital controllers and occupies very few controller resources. More importantly, since the digital controllers have already been widely adopted in the control of the LLC converters, the proposed adaptive SR driving method can be embedded into these digital controllers with little extra cost. Furthermore, how to integrate the proposed SR driving method with closed-loop control is explained in details. Experimental results are demonstrated on a 130kHz LLC converter with 100MHz microcontroller (MCU) and a 500kHz LLC converter with a 60MHz MCU and a ripple counter.	1.4
Larger and larger proportions of aluminium castings, especially those produced by the die casting process, can be observed during recent years in the automotive industry, house-hold articles and others. In case of the automotive industry, apart from the traditional elements produced by the die pressure method such as engine blocks or crank shaft bedplates, aluminium is displacing steel from structural parts of cars ('body in white'). The current state and development directions of the structural solutions of cold-chamber die castings are analysed in this paper. These solutions drive the prospective development of these machines and die casting technology. The focus is mainly on essential functional systems such as: hydraulic drives of closing and locking units, as well as pressing in die machines of known companies present on the European market.	3.3
Landsat data are increasingly used for ecological monitoring and research. These data often require preprocessing prior to analysis to account for sensor, solar, atmospheric, and topographic effects. However, ecologists using these data are faced with a literature containing inconsistent terminology, outdated methods, and a vast number of approaches with contradictory recommendations. These issues can, at best, make determining the correct preprocessing workflow a difficult and time-consuming task and, at worst, lead to erroneous results. We address these problems by providing a concise overview of the Landsat missions and sensors and by clarifying frequently conflated terms and methods. Preprocessing steps commonly applied to Landsat data are differentiated and explained, including georeferencing and co-registration, conversion to radiance, solar correction, atmospheric correction, topographic correction, and relative correction. We then synthesize this information by presenting workflows and a decision tree for determining the appropriate level of imagery preprocessing given an ecological research question, while emphasizing the need to tailor each workflow to the study site and question at hand. We recommend a parsimonious approach to Landsat preprocessing that avoids unnecessary steps and recommend approaches and data products that are well tested, easily available, and sufficiently documented. Our focus is specific to ecological applications of Landsat data, yet many of the concepts and recommendations discussed are also appropriate for other disciplines and remote sensing platforms.	4.2
In the Netherlands, as in most other western European countries, the desirability and the governability of a multicultural society are topics of debate. In the last decade, this debate has increasingly centred on second-generation migrants, focusing on their high rates of crime and school drop-out. In the Dutch context, however, little scholarly research has paid attention to second-generation migrants' own experiences. In this paper, I therefore focus on the perceptions of ethnic boundaries held by 12- to 19-year-old second-generation migrants and how they negotiate these boundaries in the low-income, multi-ethnic Feijenoord area of Rotterdam. The study shows that young people are used to living together with many different cultures and see themselves as being on both sides of the ethnic boundary between the Dutch-majority society and the culture of their parents. However, they also encounter prejudice and discrimination in their day-to-day lives, which calls into question the success of multiculturalism.	2.0
Water and energy consumption has increased substantially over the last decades. Water scarcity has led to an increase in the extraction of fresh water from aquifers, dams and lakes, and it has produced serious overexploitation problems. Furthermore, the population growth in urbanized areas and the increase in water and energy demands in industry, agriculture and households have amplified this problem. As consequence, there are several regions where is almost impossible to satisfy the water demands using the available water resources. In this context, the use of alternative water resources such as reclaimed water, rainwater harvesting and the potential use of desalinated water can be an option. However, desalinated seawater is very expensive because the high energy consumption, and this way to integrate a seawater desalination plant to a power plant to simultaneously produce clean water and power can be an attractive option. This way, this paper proposes an optimization formulation for synthesizing water networks to satisfy water and energy demands in a macroscopic system involving the use of existing water resources and the installation of integrated seawater desalination-power plants. A case study from Mexico (where satisfying the water demands has become a serious problem) is presented. Results show that the integrated system is able to satisfy the current water demands, the excess desalinated water can be used to recharge the overexploited aquifers and interesting profits can be obtained from the sales of power.

After more than a decade of research, web application security continues to be a challenge and the backend database the most appetizing target. The paper proposes preventing injection attacks against the database management system (DBMS) behind web applications by embedding protections in the DBMS itself. The motivation is twofold. First, the approach of embedding protections in operating systems and applications running on top of them has been effective to protect these applications. Second, there is a semantic mismatch between how SQL queries are believed to be executed by the DBMS and how they are actually executed, leading to subtle vulnerabilities in protection mechanisms. The approach SEPTIC was implemented in MySQL and evaluated experimentally with web applications written in PHP and Java/Spring. In the evaluation SEPTIC has shown neither false negatives nor false positives, on the contrary of alternative approaches, causing also a low performance overhead in the order of 2.2%.	0.4
Sigandu is a coastal tourism area, which is located in the coastal zone of Batang District. Central Java Province. This coastal area faces severe coastal erosion problem. It is indicated that erosion processes are occurred due to the jetty construction of Batang Commercial Port. This construction cause disturbance of longshore transport equilibrium. The objective of jetty construction is to trap the sediment, however, the classical problem of erosion and accration take place in a short time, soon after the jetty construction finished. The local government of Batang District becomes aware because of this erosion problem. Commenced on September 2014, the Marine and Fisheries Affair initiates the solution by applying low-crested breakwaters structures using geotextile tube. One month after the tube installation, rapid sedimentation occurred by the formation of salients and tombolos behind the structures. Beach profile calculation have been carried out through the series of monitoring and cross section measurement as well as visual observation. This paper presents results of monitoring beach activities.. The case study is expected to be an example and applied for other coastal areas having similar coastal problems. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A field survey indicated that the Elbe and Saale Rivers were contaminated with both clofibric acid and ibuprofen. In Elbe River water we could detect the metabolite hydroxy-ibuprofen. Analyses of the city of Saskatoon sewage effluent discharged to the South Saskatchewan river detected clofibric acid but neither ibuprofen nor any metabolite. Laboratory studies indicated that the pharmaceutical ibuprofen was readily degraded in a river biofilm reactor. Two metabolites were detected and identified as hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen. Both metabolites were observed to degrade in the biofilm reactors. However, in human metabolism the metabolite carboxy-ibuprofen appears and degrades second whereas the opposite occurs in biofilm systems. In biofilms the pharmacologically inactive stereoisomere of ibuprofen is degraded predominantly. In contrast, clofibric acid was not biologically degraded during the experimental period of 21 days. Similar results were obtained using biofilms developed using waters from either the South Saskatchewan or Elbe River. In a sterile reactor no losses of ibuprofen were observed. These results suggested that abiotic losses and adsorption played only a minimal role in the fate of the pharmaceuticals in the river biofilm reactors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The present study designed to monitor and predict land cover change (LCC) in addition to characterizing LCC and its dynamics over Al-Baha region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by utilizing remote sensing and GIS-cellular automata model (Markov-CA). Moreover, to determine the effect of rainwater storage reservoirs as a driver to the expansion of irrigated cropland. Eight Landsat 5/7 TM/ETM images from 1975 to 2010 were analyzed and ultimately utilized in categorizing LC. The LC maps classified into four main classes: bare soil, sparsely vegetated, forest and shrub land, and irrigated cropland. The quantification of LCC for the analyzed categories showed that bare soil and sparsely vegetated was the largest classes throughout the study period, followed by forest, shrubland, and irrigated cropland. The processes of LCC in the study area were not constant, and varied from one class to another. There were two stages in bare soil change, an increase stage (1975-1995) and decline stage (1995-2010), and the construction of 25 rainwater-harvesting dams in the region was the turning point in bare soil change. The greatest increase was observed in irrigated cropland after 1995 in the expense of the other three categories as an effect of extensive rainwater harvesting practices. Losses were evident in forest and shrubland and sparsely vegetated land during the first stage (19751995) with 5.4 and 25.6 % of total area in 1995, while in 1975, they covered more than 13.8 and 32.7 % of total area. During the second stage (1995-2010), forest and shrubland witnessed a significant increase from 1569.17 km(2) in 1975 to 1840.87 km(2) in 2010. Irrigated cropland underwent the greatest growth (from 422.766 km(2) in 1975 to 1819.931 km(2) in 2010) during the entire study period, and this agriculture expansion reached its zenith in the 2000s. Markov-CA simulation in 2050 predicts a continuing upward trend in irrigated cropland and forest and shrubland areas, as well as a downward trend in bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas; the spatial distribution prediction indicates that irrigated cropland will expand around reservoirs and the mountain areas. The validation result showed that the model successfully identified the state of land cover in 2010 with 97 % agreement between the actual and projected cover. The output of this study would be useful for decision makers and LC/land use planners in Saudi Arabia and similar arid regions.	4.3
The aim of computational molecular design is the identification of promising hypothetical molecules with a predefined set of desired properties. We address the issue of accelerating the material discovery with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The method involves two different types of prediction; the forward and backward predictions. The objective of the forward prediction is to create a set of machine learning models on various properties of a given molecule. Inverting the trained forward models through Bayes' law, we derive a posterior distribution for the backward prediction, which is conditioned by a desired property requirement. Exploring high-probability regions of the posterior with a sequential Monte Carlo technique, molecules that exhibit the desired properties can computationally be created. One major difficulty in the computational creation of molecules is the exclusion of the occurrence of chemically unfavorable structures. To circumvent this issue, we derive a chemical language model that acquires commonly occurring patterns of chemical fragments through natural language processing of ASCII strings of existing compounds, which follow the SMILES chemical language notation. In the backward prediction, the trained language model is used to refine chemical strings such that the properties of the resulting structures fall within the desired property region while chemically unfavorable structures are successfully removed. The present method is demonstrated through the design of small organic molecules with the property requirements on HOMO-LUMO gap and internal energy. The R package iqspr is available at the CRAN repository.	0.1
The gene expression level for immune system genes was evaluated at different lifecycle stages in the white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The gene-coding pattern recognition protein, -glucan binding protein-high density lipoprotein (BGBP), from haemocytes, the effector proteins peroxinectin and clotting protein (CP), the antibacterial proteins Lysozyme, Penaeidin 3 and prophenoloxidase (proPO), and the small heat-shock protein 10 were studied. The expression of BGBP was detected from the Nauplii 3 substage and beyond (except for PL1). Peroxinectin and CP were constitutively transcribed throughout the different substages. Lysozyme, Penaeidin and proPO were also detected throughout the experimental stages (except eggs and nauplii). Lysozyme was transcribed during most of the shrimp substages, from Zoea 2 and beyond. Penaeidin 3 exhibited the lowest expression level of the genes evaluated; however, its transcription was similar to those of adults from post-larvae 11 and forward. proPO was higher transcribed during last post-larval substages. Heat-shock protein-10 was detected in all shrimp substages and exhibited higher expression at the PL substages compared to the first larval substages. Evidence suggests that the shrimp immune system is partially activated from the early larval substages, but is not completed until the shrimp have undergone the metamorphic substages.	6.3
Within some European countries, for example Germany and France, a high proportion of students secure work placements as part of their course. This opportunity develops students and strengthens industry-academia interactions. In comparison, the UK lags behinds - a point that was commented on by the UK Universities minister David Willetts recently, as regards preparing graduates for employment. This difference raises the question as to what is deficient within the partnership models within the UK in cementing an effective relationship. This paper will consider tactics to overcome this gap and the resulting operational challenges, focusing particularly on undergraduate course development. A case study will be used to illustrate the approach: Coventry University and Unipart Manufacturing Group development of a BEng Manufacturing Engineering degree. Effective strategic partnerships require a clear and shared vision, as well as an effective operational model that develops lasting relationships: a set of specific resources and learning competencies. The shared vision from both university and company was to produce work-ready graduates graduates that do not require an extended graduate training scheme; this is not the norm. The achievement of this vision required the consideration of physical environments, communication and operational challenges in order to create a deeper level of collaboration. The partnership will result in the building of an institute for academic and research development which is to be based at Unipart Manufacturing's site in Coventry. This new resource will see a learning environment where students will be based, allowing them to work on live industrial projects that reinforce taught theory. These semester-long projects will be proposed by the company and progress will be mentored by University subject-specialists and industrial workplace mentors. This teaching model of one project for each 16-week semester resulted from a series of discussions factoring the voices of the three main stakeholders: Academic institute (AI), Industry partner (IP) and the students. A key challenge that this held was interpreting each voice - what are they really saying and what do they really want, as past experiences show when Universities and Industry come together to form partnerships differences in language and terminology created barriers. Academic hybrids (an academic who has transferred from professional practice to higher education) were key translators between AIs and IPs - allowing the move from elaborative language to restrictive language and back again to ensure no misunderstanding. The close and frequent interaction of students with industrial mentors on a company's site built into the semester-long projects brings a number of new challenges - particularly identifying live projects suitable for each level of study, the rules of engagement (how do the students gain access to the shop floor), health and safety, intellectual property rights and maintaining general and transferable skills (not only the company approach). The resolution of these dimensions will be outlined to demonstrate how work-relevant degree programs require a unique set of competencies to develop and implement.	3.2
It would be an advantage if there were a measurement method, which would provide more detailed spatial information on water contaminations at low cost. Hyperspectral Remote Sensing has a possibility for gathering detailed: contamination information rapidly and inexpensively. This study includes the possibility of assessing heavy metal contamination of water in Mariut Lake and predicting models describe their concentration using spectrum data taken by portable FieldSpec_ 3 ASD Spectroradiometer. The main objectives of this research are assessing water contamination by heavy metal in Mariut Lake using laboratory analysis and developing a predictive model for water pollution based on the spectral characteristics and lab data obtained. It is resulted that Pb, Ni and Cr concentrations exceed permissible limit of USEPA. Also, the spectral reflectance of (6-13, 16, 19 and 20) at wavelength 582-653 nm is related to the spectral behavior of the high chlorophyll concentration. Also there are 7 samples (1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 19 and 21) showed high and low values of turbidity. As the suspended sediment concentration increased, reflectance also increased at all wavelengths between 400 and 850 nm. It is concluded that most of models predicting heavy metals concentration using reflectance spectroscopy have high significant correlation ranged from 0.27 to 0.97.

Increasing demand for water and energy sources, accompanied by continued increases in the prices of these sources, has been observed worldwide. This has resulted in the need to seek alternative sources. In response to this statement, a cost-effective analysis has been carried out to enable the use of selected systems to reduce demands for potable water and natural gas used for heating in single-family homes. The study includes the Drain Water Heat Recovery System, Gray Water Harvesting System and Rainwater Harvesting System. The Life Cycle Cost methodology has been applied as a tool for the analysis. Depending on the number of users and rate of piped water consumption the determined Life Cycle Cost indicator ranged from (sic)11519 to (sic)19678. The study has shown that the highest life cycle cost are characteristic of the graywater recycling variant. In circumstances where water consumption in homes for purposes of showering and toilet flushing exceeded 300 L per day, the most cost-effective is the option that combines all systems analyzed. The most preferred, in the other cases was the use of Rainwater Harvesting System. The sensitivity analysis carried out has also shown that costs changes associated with building water supply and sewerage facilities has had the greatest impact on life cycle costs of each solution. The analysis have shown that the systems under consideration could serve as alternatives for traditional installations. Their use has resulted in reductions in the consumption of fossil fuels and natural water resources, thus contributing to environmental improvements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.3
Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) have been historically deployed to cover the base-load of the electricity demand. Nowadays some NPPs might perform daily load cycling operation (i.e. load following) between 50% and 100% of their rated power. With respect to the insertion of control rods or comparable action to reduce the nuclear power generation, a more efficient alternative might be the Load Following by Cogeneration, i.e. diverting the excess of power, respect to the electricity demand, to an auxiliary system. A suitable cogeneration system needs: 1. To have a demand of electricity and/or heat in the region of 500 MWe-1.5 GWt; 2. To meet a significant market demand; 3. To have access to adequate input to process; 4. To be flexible: cogeneration might operate at full load during the night when the request of electricity is low, and be turned off during the daytime. From the economic standpoint, it is essential that the investment in the auxiliary system is profitable. This paper provides a techno-economic assessment of systems potentially suitable for coupling with a NPP for load following. The results show that district heating, desalination and hydrogen might be technically and economically feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), defined by expression of the transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor gamma t, play key roles in the regulation of inflammation and immunity in the gastrointestinal tract and associated lymphoid tissues. ILC3 consist largely of two major subsets, NCR+ ILC3 and LTi-like ILC3, but also demonstrate significant plasticity and heterogeneity. Recent advances have begun to dissect the relationship between ILC3 subsets and to define distinct functional states within the intestinal tissue microenvironment. In this review we discuss the ever-expanding roles of ILC3 in the context of intestinal homeostasis, infection and inflammation - with a focus on comparing and contrasting the relative contributions of ILC3 subsets.	6.3
The violations of the second law are relevant as the length and/or time scales become very small. The second law then needs to be replaced by the fluctuation theorem and mathematically, the irreversible entropy is a submartingale. First, we discuss the consequences of these results for the axioms of continuum mechanics, arguing in favor of a framework relying on stochastic functionals of energy and entropy. We next determine a Lyapunov function for diffusion-type problems governed by stochastic rather than deterministic functionals of internal energy and entropy, where the random field coefficients of diffusion are not required to satisfy the positive definiteness everywhere. Next, a formulation of micropolar fluid mechanics is developed, accounting for the lack of symmetry of stress tensor on molecular scales. This framework is then applied to employed to show that spontaneous random fluctuations of the microrotation field will arise in Couette-and Poiseuille-type flows in the absence of random (turbulence-like) fluctuations of the classical velocity field. Finally, while the permeability is classically modeled by the Darcy law or its modifications, besides considering the violations of the second law, one also needs to account for the spatial randomness of the channel network, implying a modification of the hierarchy of scale-dependent bounds on the macroscopic property of the network.	3.4
Most of the present knowledge about cell organization and function is based on molecular and genetic methods as well as cytological investigations. While electron microscopy allows identifying cell substructures until a resolution of similar to 1 nm, the resolution of fluorescence microscopy is restricted to similar to 200 nm due to the diffraction limit of light. However, the advantage of this technique is the possibility to identify and co-localize specifically labeled structures and molecules. The recently developed super-resolution microscopy techniques, such as Structured Illumination Microscopy, Photoactivated Localization Microscopy, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy, and Stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy allow analyzing structures and molecules beyond the diffraction limit of light. Recently, there is an increasing application of these techniques in cell biology. This review evaluates and summarizes especially the data achieved until now in analyzing the organization and function of plant cells, chromosomes and interphase nuclei using super-resolution techniques.	6.1
This paper deals with the characterization and construction of a rotating brushless PM exciter intended for synchronous generator excitation purposes. Traditionally, PM exciters are used as pre-exciters in synchronous generator excitations systems. In order to reduce the number of components and to increase the step time response of the system, a PM exciter is designed as an outer pole PM machine, with permanent magnets on the stator and armature windings on the rotor. The exciter was constructed electrically and mechanically to be fitted into an in-house synchronous generator test setup. A finite element model of the exciter was validated with no-load measurements of voltages and magnetic flux densities. The exciter was then characterized with unsaturated and saturated parameters.	3.3
Discrete fluid power systems featuring transmission lines inherently include pressure oscillations. Experimental verification of a discrete fluid power power take off system for wave energy converters has shown the cylinder pressure to oscillate as force shifts are performed. This article investigates how cylinder pressure oscillations may be reduced by shaping the valve opening trajectory without the need for closed loop pressure feedback. Furthermore the energy costs of reducing pressure oscillations are investigated.	3.1
Rationale The negative affective state, e.g., anhedonia, emerges after abstinence from abused drugs may be linked to the motivational processes of drug craving and relapse. Although anhedonia diminishes over time with drug abstinence, it is not yet rather explicit whether anhedonia exists or not following protracted withdrawal. Objectives The behavioral responses to natural rewards were examined after 2 to 3 weeks withdrawal from morphine. Male rats were pretreated with either a binge-like morphine paradigm or daily saline injection for 5 days. The consummatory and motivational behaviors for three natural rewards (sucrose solutions 4, 15, and 60%, social stimulus: male rat, and sexual stimulus: estrous female rat) were examined under varied testing conditions. Results The morphine-withdrawn rats significantly increased their intake of 15% sucrose solution during the 1-h consumption test and their operant responding for 15% sucrose solution under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. When obtaining a reinforcer was associated with a 0.5 mA foot shock under a PR-punishment schedule, the morphinewithdrawn rats showed a higher performance for 60% sucrose solution. Meanwhile, the morphine-withdrawn rats displayed a higher motivation to sexual stimulus during the freeapproach test and more approaching behaviors towards sexual stimulus in a conflict-based approach test (concurrent presence of reward and aversive stimulus). Conclusions No anhedonia-like behavior but sensitized behaviors for natural rewards were found after long-term morphine withdrawal. Notably, the morphine-withdrawn rats displayed persistent motivated behaviors for high-value rewards (60% sucrose and sexual stimulus) in the conflict tests suggesting impairments in inhibitory control in morphinetreated rats.	5.0
How does the acquisition of information about a person affect the liking of that person? A recent set of studies suggests that liking decreases as people acquire more information (Norton, Frost, & Ariely, 2007). We test this less-is-more hypothesis along with an alternative hypothesis based on information integration theory. According to this alternative, people average available person information in an unbiased manner so that the liking of a person described by a random sample of any number of traits from a trait universe approximates the degree of liking that would be obtained if all trait information were known. The correlation between liking and the number of traits should be zero. We present the results of computer simulation and 2 empirical person-judgment studies. Using Bayesian analyses, we find that the evidence is more consistent with the information-integration hypothesis than with the less-is-more hypothesis.	2.2
The present research investigates whether spontaneous trait inferences occur under conditions characteristic of social media and networking sites: nonextreme, ostensibly self-generated content, simultaneous presentation of multiple cues, and self-paced browsing. We used an established measure of trait inferences (false recognition paradigm) and a direct assessment of impressions. Without being asked to do so, participants spontaneously formed impressions of people whose status updates they saw. Our results suggest that trait inferences occurred from nonextreme self-generated content, which is commonly found in social media updates (Experiment 1) and when nine status updates from different people were presented in parallel (Experiment 2). Although inferences did occur during free browsing, the results suggest that participants did not necessarily associate the traits with the corresponding status update authors (Experiment 3). Overall, the findings suggest that spontaneous trait inferences occur on social media. We discuss implications for online communication and research on spontaneous trait inferences.	2.2
HJ-1A hyperspectral data were used to distinguish topsoil salt components and estimate soil salinity, and the relationship between soil salt chemical components and sensitive bands of soil reflectance spectra was analyzed. The correlation between the soil salt content and the soil spectra obtained from the hyperspectral data was analyzed, proving that topsoil salinity has a very significant correlation with soil reflectance spectra. The relationship between soil reflectance spectra and salt chemical ions was investigated. The soil spectral reflectance at wavelength 510.975 nm and a difference vegetation index were selected to estimate soil salinity and the dominant salt chemical ion concentrations at a depth of 0 to 10 cm using a partial least squares regression model. It was found that the bands sensitive to various levels of chemical components of soil salt were shown to differ, controlled by the dominant component of the soil salt. The sensitive bands in the soil salinity estimation will change with differences in salt components. Estimating the dominant salt in the soil using soil reflectance spectra will lead to greater prediction accuracy. This study provided a possible method for the estimation of salinity and chemical component levels in topsoil, using the hyperspectral data to estimate topsoil salt components. (C) The Authors.

Recent advances in flow-based microfluidic biochips have enabled the emergence of lab-on-a-chip devices for bimolecular recognition and point-of-care disease diagnostics. However, the adoption of flow-based biochips is hampered today by the lack of computer-aided design tools. Manual design procedures not only delay product development but they also inhibit the exploitation of the design complexity that is possible with current fabrication techniques. In this paper, we present the first practical problem formulation for automated control-layer design in flow-based microfluidic very large-scale integration (mVLSI) biochips and propose a systematic approach for solving this problem. Our goal is to find an efficient routing solution for control-layer design with a minimum number of control pins. The pressure-propagation delay, an intrinsic physical phenomenon in mVLSI biochips, is minimized in order to reduce the response time for valves, decrease the pattern set-up time, and synchronize valve actuation. Two fabricated flow-based devices and six synthetic benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed optimization method. Compared with manual control-layer design and a baseline approach, the proposed approach leads to fewer control pins, better timing behavior, and shorter channel length in the control layer.	3.0
Yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea) grows in small, widely scattered populations in the wild, but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside its natural range. Since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states are considered at risk of extirpation, the cultivated population could serve as an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore lost local populations of the species. The potential value of cultivated yellowwood for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared to natural populations. Using nuclear microsatellite markers, we genotyped 180 yellowwoods from natural populations in Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky, along with 61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri. We found that, even when statistics were adjusted based on population size, the urban population had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled, indicating that commercially-grown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated wild populations. We observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations, and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations.	6.4
Marangoni convection in a volatile liquid film subject to a horizontal temperature gradient confined in a rectangular cavity is a basic problem of heat transfer and fluid mechanics with applications in evaporative cooling. The Marangoni stresses that drive this flow are due to surface tension gradients at the liquid-vapor interface. The thermocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with temperature for the most part drive the liquid away from hot regions. A volatile binary-fluid mixture can, however, be designed so that the solutocapillary stresses due to variations in surface tension with concentration drive the liquid instead towards hot regions, and hence oppose thermocapillary stresses. In thicker liquid layers, the flow is also affected by buoyancy. This work details an experimental study of buoyancy-Marangoni convection in a similar to 0.31 cm deep layer of methanol-water (MeOH-H2O) in a sealed rectangular cuvette driven by a temperature difference of similar to 6 degrees C over a horizontal distance of 4.9 cm. Particle pathline visualizations and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) were used to study this flow and determine how the liquid composition, quantified in terms of the MeOH concentration C-M, and noncondensables (i.e., air), quantified by the concentration of air in the gas space above the liquid c(a), affect the flow. Solutocapillary effects are strong enough to drive the liquid near the free surface towards the heated end over the entire horizontal extent of the liquid layer at low ca (i.e., c(a) < 6%), suggesting that binary-fluid coolants could significantly reduce film dryout. This flow, driven by thermocapillarity, solutocapillarity and buoyancy, is classified into four distinct flow regimes that are summarized in a ca vs. CM flow regime map. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Most individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis do not transition to frank illness. Nevertheless, many have poor clinical outcomes and impaired psychosocial functioning. This study used voxel-based morphometry to investigate if baseline grey and white matter brain densities at identification as UHR were associated with functional outcome at medium-to long-term follow-up. Participants were help-seeking UHR individuals (n = 109, 54M: 55F) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline; functional outcome was assessed an average of 9.2 years later. Primary analysis showed that lower baseline grey matter density, but not white matter density, in bilateral frontal and limbic areas, and left cerebellar declive were associated with poorer functional outcome (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale [SOFAS]). These findings were independent of transition to psychosis or persistence of the at-risk mental state. Similar regions were significantly associated with lower self-reported levels of social functioning and increased negative symptoms at follow-up. Exploratory analyses showed that lower baseline grey matter densities in middle and inferior frontal gyri were significantly associated with decline in Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score over follow- up. There was no association between baseline grey matter density and IQ or positive symptoms at followup. The current findings provide novel evidence that those with the poorest functional outcomes have the lowest grey matter densities at identification as UHR, regardless of transition status or persistence of the at-risk mental state. Replication and validation of these findings may allow for early identification of poor functional outcome and targeted interventions.	2.1
Objectives: Based on the premise that internalized homonegativity (IH) is a product of the incorporation of environmental heterosexism, the authors examined the influence of sociopolitical and individual influences on IH. Methods: The cross-sectional study consisted of 109,382 gay and bisexual men across 77 countries. Results: Variables at the (European) country-level that were associated with higher levels of IH included lack of laws recognizing same-sex relationships and perceived and actual negative gay-related public opinion about homosexuals. Individual-level variables significantly associated with IH were public opinion about homosexuals and exposure to gay-related victimization/discrimination. Conclusions: An improved sociopolitical climate for LGB individuals is needed.	2.0
Background: Excessive gambling is considered to be a part of the addiction spectrum. Stress-like emotional states are a key feature both of pathological gambling (PG) and of substance addiction. In substance addiction, stress symptomatology has been attributed in part to anti-reward allostatic neuroadaptations, while a potential involvement of anti-reward processes in the course of PG has not yet been investigated. Methods: To that end, individuals with PG (n = 22) and mentally healthy subjects (n = 13) were assessed for trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) using the Life Events Checklist and the Civilian Mississippi Scale, respectively. Results: In comparison with healthy subjects, individuals with PG had significantly greater PTSS scores including greater physiological arousal sub-scores. The number of traumatic events and their recency were not significantly different between the groups. In the PG group, greater gambling severity was associated with more PTSS, but neither with traumatic events exposure nor with their recency. Conclusions: Our data replicate prior reports on the role of traumatic stress in the course of PG and extend those findings by suggesting that the link may be derived from the anti-reward-type neuroadaptation rather than from the traumatic stress exposure per se.	5.0
We study empirical metrics for software source code, which can predict the performance of verification tools on specific types of software. Our metrics comprise variable usage patterns, loop patterns, as well as indicators of control-flow complexity and are extracted by simple data-flow analyses. We demonstrate that our metrics are powerful enough to devise a machine-learning based portfolio solver for software verification. We show that this portfolio solver would be the (hypothetical) overall winner of the international competition on software verification (SV-COMP) in three consecutive years (2014-2016). This gives strong empirical evidence for the predictive power of our metrics and demonstrates the viability of portfolio solvers for software verification. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our algorithm for portfolio construction in novel settings: originally conceived for SV-COMP'14, the construction works just as well for SV-COMP'15 (considerably more verification tasks) and for SV-COMP'16 (considerably more candidate verification tools).	0.1
Direct eye contact is a powerful social cue to regulate interpersonal interactions. Previous behavioral studies showed a link between eye contact and motor mimicry, indicating that the automatic mimicry of observed hand movements is significantly enhanced when direct eye contact exists between the observer and the observed model. In the present study, we aim to investigate the neurophysiological basis of the previously reported behavioral enhancements. Here, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to assess changes in cortico-motor excitability at the level of the primary motor cortex (MI) to explore whether and how the motor system is facilitated from observing others' hand movements and, in particular, how this process is modulated by eye contact. To do so, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from two hand muscles while participants received single-pulse TMS and naturally observed video clips of an actor showing hand opening movements or static hands. During the observation, either direct or averted eye gaze was established between the subject and the observed actor. Our findings show a clear effect of eye gaze on observation-induced motor facilitation. This indicates that the mapping or 'mirroring' of others' movements is significantly enhanced when movement observation is accompanied by direct eye gaze compared to averted eye gaze. Our results support the notion that eye contact is a powerful social signal with the ability to direct human non-verbal social behavior. Furthermore, our findings are important for understanding the role of the mirror motor system in the mapping of socially relevant actions.	2.1
Availability of a safe and reliable water supply is an issue in developing nations, including India. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a site-specific source control used to satisfy human, agricultural, and safety demands for water. This study analyzed the effects of capturing rainwater for a 12.5 year period (Jan 1999-Jun 2011) to provide three ecosystem services: water supplementation for indoor use, water supplementation for food production and groundwater recharge (GWR). A hydrologic analysis was completed using satellite rainfall data and a water balance approach. Two demand scenarios, indoor and outdoor, were considered, with water in excess of demand and storage directed to recharge groundwater. An economic analysis quantified RWH system net present value. The results indicated significant ecosystem services benefits were possible from RWH in India. RWH for the purpose of providing irrigation to a small garden and allowing overflow to a drywell for GWR was concluded to be an approach to maximize benefits. This scenario provided the greatest net present value (21,764-38,851 INR), fastest payback period (0.30-0.98 years), and recharge to groundwater of more than 40% of onsite rainfall. The benefit of the outdoor vegetable irrigation was determined and the results showed that the caloric demands of the typical Indian household (2.75kg of tomatoes and 1.05kg of lettuce) could be met with a 20m(2) garden, and excess food could be sold to offset the capital cost of the system and later for economic gain.	4.3
Ideas are commonly described using metaphors; a bright idea appears like a light bulb'' or the seed'' of an idea takes root. However, little is known about how these metaphors may shape beliefs about ideas or the role of effort versus genius in their creation, an important omission given the known motivational consequences of such beliefs. We explore whether the light bulb metaphor, although widespread and intuitively appealing, may foster the belief that innovative ideas are exceptional occurrences that appear suddenly and effortlessly-inferences that may be particularly compatible with gendered stereotypes of genius as male. Across three experiments, we find evidence that these metaphors influence judgments of idea quality and perceptions of an inventor's genius. Moreover, these effects varied by the inventor's gender and reflected prevailing gender stereotypes: Whereas the seed (vs. light bulb) metaphor increased the perceived genius of female inventors, the opposite pattern emerged for male inventors.	2.1
In this work, we perform a comparative analysis between single and dual metal dielectrically modulated tunnel field-effect transistors (DMTFETs) for the application of label free biosensor. For this purpose, two different gate material with work-function as Phi(M1) and Phi(M2) are used in short-gate DMTFET, where Phi(M1) represents the work-function of gate M1 near to the drain end, while Phi(M2) denotes the work-function of gate M2 near to the source end. A nanogap cavity in the gate dielectric is formed by removing the selected portion of gate oxide for sensing the biomolecules. To investigate the sensitivity of these biosensors, dielectric constant and charge density within the cavity region are considered as governing parameters. The work-function of gate M2 is optimized and considered less than M1 to achieve abruptness at the source/channel junction, which results in better tunneling and improved ON-state current. The ATLAS device simulations show that dual metal SGDMTFETs attains higher ON-state current and drain current sensitivity as compared to its counterpart device. Finally, a dual metal short-gate (DSG) biosensor is compared with the single metal short-gate (SG), single metal full-gate (FG), and dual metal full-gate (DFG) biosensors to analyse structurally enhanced conjugation effect on gate-channel coupling.

The purpose of this study was to compare personality traits using the Big Five personality taxonomy and alcohol consumption of classical and heavy metal musicians. Also, we compared personality traits of classical and heavy metal musicians with norms for the Croatian population, and data on alcohol consumption with a representative sample of the general Croatian population. Participants in the study were men (N = 249) playing either classical (N = 113) or heavy metal music (N = 136). Personality was measured with the IPIP-50 personality questionnaire and participants answered several questions about alcohol consumption. We found no significant differences in personality traits between classical and heavy metal musicians, but both classical and heavy metal musicians differed significantly in personality from the norms, having higher scores on extraversion, agreeableness, and especially intellect. Belonging to a heavy metal musicians group was associated with consuming alcohol more often. Also, frequency of alcohol consumption was statistically higher for heavy metal musicians than in the general population.	5.0
Nowadays, population growth, environmental constraints and climate change can adversely affect our water supply systems' ability to keep up with demand. Due to lack of unsuitable distribution and dispersion of water resources, precipitation, soil resources, etc., inter-basin transfers of water could be a solution in order to balancing between supply and demand water in different areas. In this study, the optimal designing of water conveyance from basin No-1 to basin No-2 is investigated. Water is transferred between these two dams by tunnel structure. Since the water flow through the tunnel is under pressure, increasing dam height will cause the decrease of tunnel diameter for constant water conveyance efficiency. The purpose of this study is transferring 95 % of water flow between two basins after supplying the agriculture consumption and environmental needs. Therefore, the mathematical program was developed first to solve the governing equations of water balance of reservoir and hydraulic of tunnel. Then, various strategies including different diameters of tunnel and dam height were considered and finally the best strategy from economic and technical viewpoint was proposed. The results showed that dam height of 151.2 m and tunnel diameter of 3.2 m are the economic options to convey of 95 % of the water.	3.1
Multi-label image classification is a challenging problem in computer vision. Motivated by the recent development in image classification performance using Deep Neural Networks, in this work, we propose a flexible deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework, called Local-Global-CNN (LGC), to improve multi-label image classification performance. LGC consists of firstly a local level multi-label classifier which takes object segment hypotheses as inputs to a local CNN. The output results of these local hypotheses are aggregated together with max-pooling and then re-weighted to consider the label co-occurrence or inter-dependencies information by using a graphical model in the label space. LGC also utilizes a global CNN that is trained by multi-label images to directly predict the multiple labels from the input. The predictions of local and global level classifiers are finally fused together to obtain MAP estimation of the final multi-label prediction. The above LGC framework could benefit from a pre-train process with a large-scale single-label image dataset, e.g., ImageNet. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework could achieve promising performance on Pascal VOC2007 and VOC2012 multi-label image dataset.	0.0
Drought, water loss and soil erosion are the main factors limiting agricultural production in semi-arid regions of China. A field study was conducted to determine (1) the runoff efficiencies of different ridge widths (30,45 and 60 cm) covered with different materials (common plastic film, biodegradable mulching film and manual compacted soil) and (2) the effects of different ridge-furrow ratios (30:60, 45:60 and 60:60) and ridge-covering materials on soil water storage, topsoil temperature, hay yield, grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of oats in ridge-furrow rainwater harvesting (RFRH) system at the Dingxi Agri-meteorological station, during 2 consecutive years of 2012 and 2013. Average runoff efficiency was 18%, 20%, 22%, 71%, 77%, 83%, 76%, 77% and 84% for SR30, SR45, SR60, BMR30, BMR45, BMR60, CMR30, CMR45 and CMR60 (SR, BMR and CMR were ridges with compacted soil, covered with biodegradable mulch film and common plastic film, respectively, and subscript numbers 30,45 and 60 stand for ridge widths (cm)) over 2 years, respectively. The field experiment using oats as an indicator crop showed that mulching materials and ridge widths had distinct effects on topsoil temperature on the top of the ridges, but not in the bottom of the furrows. The soil water storage in the 140 cm depth of soil at the bottom of furrows increased with increasing ridge widths and in the order of CMR approximate to BMR >SR >FP (FP was the flat planting). The total precipitation was 414.4 mm in 2012 and 448.8 mm in 2013, which were higher than the average of rainfall (388.1 mm), leading to a significant increase of hay and grain yield in CMR, and an equivalent of hay and grain yield in BMR compared with FP in most cases. In the SR system, the positive effects of rainwater harvesting could not compensate for the negative effects of planting area reduction resulting in decrease in hay and grain yield. Compared with FP, the average grain yield decreased by 19%, 27% and 34% for SR30, SR45 and SR60, and increased by 6%, 4%, 1%, 12%, 9% and 6% for BMR30, BMR45, BMR60, CMR30, CMR45 and CMR60 over 2 years, respectively. The WUE of SR. BMR and CMR was 131, 1.41 and 1.47 times greater than that in FP over 2 years, and increased with increasing ridge width. The optimum furrow width was 32-38 cm for CMR and was 30-34 cm for BMR. Future study is needed to investigate the impact of RFRH on crop production, WUE and economic benefit under different precipitations, soil types, slopes and plant species using biodegradable mulching materials.

This work proposes a novel physics-based model for the fluid mechanics and heat transfer associated with slug flow boiling in horizontal circular microchannels to update the widely used three-zone model of Thome et al. (2004). The heat transfer model has a convective boiling nature and predicts the time dependent variation of the local heat transfer coefficient during the cyclic passage of a liquid slug, an evaporating elongated bubble and a vapor plug. The capillary flow theory, extended to incorporate evaporation effects, is applied to estimate the bubble velocity along the channel. A liquid film thickness prediction method also considering bubble proximity effects, which may limit the radial extension of the film, is included. The minimum liquid film thickness at dryout is set to the channel wall roughness. Theoretical heat transfer models accounting for the thermal inertia of the liquid film and for the recirculating flow within the liquid slug are utilized. The heat transfer model is compared to experimental data taken from three independent studies. The 833 slug flow boiling data points cover the fluids R134a, R245fa and R236fa, and channel diameters below 1 mm. The proposed evaporation model predicts more than 80% of the database to within +/- 30%. It demonstrates a stronger contribution to heat transfer by the liquid slugs and correspondingly less by the thin film evaporation process compared to the original three-zone model. This model represents a new step towards a complete physics-based modelling of the bubble dynamics and heat transfer within microchannels under evaporating flow conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Purpose This paper reviews and adapts the methodology Guide on the methodology for carrying out cost-benefit analysis prepared by the European Commission (EC). It is specifically tailored to the assessment of an innovative rail freight service, and its application in the context of a number of potential service areas (principally pan European) in Europe. The SPECTRUM service is an innovative rail freight concept for the transport of low density high value (LDHV) goods. Methods The methodology is primarily based on the Guide to cost-benefit analysis of investment projects of the European Commission. The cost definition takes input from a Life Cycle Cost analysis and applies a series of conversion factors. The benefits have been estimated considering the user's surplus, i.e. the difference between Generalised Logistic Costs (GLC) borne by transport/logistics operators (and more in general freight transport service users) when using the SPECTRUM service and GLC connected to preshift mode, i.e. road or traditional rail; and the difference in external costs generated by freight transport activities connected to externalities such as air pollution and climate change, noise, accidents, and other externalities (up-and down-stream processes, nature and landscape, biodiversity losses, soil and water pollution, congestion). Results The adapted methodology has proven capable of representing the multiple effects resulting from the theoretical introduction of an innovative rail service in the freight transport sector - accounting for the differential impacts compared to the baseline scenario solutions. The logical articulation of the analysis is flexible; two specific estimation schemes (the estimation of ad hoc unit parameters for the external costs and ad hoc approach for using GLC as proxies of users' surplus in a scenario where the introduction of the innovative service modifies the modal split of freight transport between different solutions) can be applied to other territorial contexts. It may also be used to evaluate other types of freight transport services, provided that some unit data can be retrieved, which pertain to site-specific cost of infrastructures, average speeds and rates of different transport solutions, costs of personnel and other operating costs.	4.4
Protein misfolding and aggregation has been implicated as the cause of more than 20 diseases in humans such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and systemic amyloidosis. Retardation of A beta-42 aggregation is considered as a promising and challenging strategy for developing effective therapeutics against Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we demonstrated the effect of vitamin B12 (VB) on inhibiting amyloid formation by employing ThT fluorescence assay, circular dichroism, ANS fluorescence assay, dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy and cell viability assay. Our results demonstrate that vitamin B12 (VB), inhibits A beta-42 aggregation in a concentration dependent manner. Further VB also provide protection against amyloid induced cytotoxicity in human neuronal cell line. This study points towards a promising strategy to combat A beta-42 aggregation and may have broader implication for targeting other neurological disorders whose distinct hallmark is also amyloid formation.

A 10-week course was designed with funding from the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) and input from industry representatives, to offer upper division engineering students a course on advanced automation. The objective was to provide engineering students theoretical and hands-on practical experience with automation technologies that will be of prime importance over the next decade: data acquisition and instrumentation, machine vision and motion control. This paper describes the machine vision portion of that class. It describes important concepts, hands-on equipment, and labs developed for this course, as well as examples of student projects from Spring Quarter, 2004. The course and laboratory materials were evaluated for learning effectiveness and technical content, which are included in this paper.	3.2
The mental representation of the self is a complex construct, comprising both conceptual information and perceptual information regarding the body. Evidence suggests that both the conceptual self-representation and the bodily selfrepresentation are malleable, and that these different aspects of the self are linked. Changes in bodily self-representation appear to affect how the self is conceptualized, but it is unclear whether the opposite relationship is also true: Do changes to the conceptual self-representation affect how the physical self is perceived? First, we adopted a perceptual matching paradigm to establish an association between the self and an unfamiliar face (Experiment 1). Robust attentional and perceptual biases in the processing of this newly self-associated object suggested that the conceptual self-representation was extended to include it. Next, we measured whether the bodily self-representation had correspondingly changed to incorporate the new face (Experiment 2). Participants rated morphs between their own and the newly-associated according to how similar they were to the self, before and after performing the perceptual matching task. Changes to the conceptual self did not have an effect on the bodily self-representation. These results suggest that modulatory links between aspects of the mental self-representation, when focused on the nonsocial self, are unidirectional and flow in a bottom-up manner.	2.1
This paper refers to recovering waste heat from the hot gases exhausted by internal combustion engines (ICEs) driving electric generators (EGs) at full and partial load. The topic is of particular interest for developing countries where electric grids are underdeveloped or missing and electricity is generated locally by using classical fuels. The heat recovery system is based on an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). A novel method is proposed for the optimum design of ORC-based systems operating in combination with ICE at partial EG loads. First, ORC-based systems coupled with ICEs operating at full EG load is treated. Specific results for the operation at full EG load are as follows: (i) the optimum superheating increment ranges between 30 and 40 degrees C, depending on the type of the working fluids; (ii) a pinch point temperature difference exits between the flue gas temperature and the working fluid at the evaporator inlet; (iii) the total area of the evaporator is very close to the total area of the condenser, a fact which facilitates manufacturing; (iv) the surface area of the preheater zone is about 75% of the total surface area, while those of the boiler zone and superheater zone is about 13.5% and 11.5%, respectively. Second, the case of the ORC-based systems coupled with ICEs operating at partial EG load is considered. Specific results for this case are as follows: (v) the net power may be maximized by optimizing the working fluid mass flow rate; (vi) when the ICE is coupled with an ORC-based system, the overall thermal efficiency of the combined system, eta(ICE-ORC), is higher than the thermal efficiency of the ICE operating alone. As an example, for the case treated here, 'eta(ICE-ORC) is higher than Hits. by 6.00%, 5.85% and 5.91%, for EG loads of 100%, 75% and 50%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.	1.0
Background: Selenium is an essential element, but its metabolism in humans is not well characterized. A few small studies indicate that the trimethylselenonium ion (TMSe) is a common selenium metabolite in humans. Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of selenium to TMSe. Design: Study individuals constituted subsamples of 2 cohorts: 1) pregnant women (n = 228) and their 5-y-old children (n = 205) in rural Bangladesh with poor selenium status [median urinary selenium (U-Se): 6.4 mu g/L in mothers, 14 mu g/L in children] and 2) women in the Argentinian Andes (n = 83) with adequate selenium status (median U-Se: 24 mu g/L). Total U-Se and blood selenium were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), and urinary concentrations of TMSe were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/vapor generation/ICPMS. A genomewide association study (GWAS) was performed for 1,629,299 (after filtration) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Bangladeshi women (n = 72) by using Illumina Omni5M, and results were validated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: TMSe producers were prevalent (approximately one-third) among the Bangladeshi women and their children, in whom TMSe constituted similar to 10-70% of U-Se, whereas nonproducers had, on average, 0.59% TMSe. The TMSe-producing women had, on average, 2-mu g U-Se/L higher concentrations than did the nonproducers. In contrast, only 3 of the 83 Andean women were TMSe producers (6-15% TMSe in the urine); the average percentage among the nonproducers was 0.35%. Comparison of the percentage of urinary TMSe in mothers and children indicated a strong genetic influence. The GWAS identified 3 SNPs in the indolethylamine N-methyltransferase gene (INMT) that were strongly associated with percentage of TMSe (P < 0.001, false-discovery rate corrected) in both cohorts. Conclusions: There are remarkable population and individual variations in the formation of TMSe, which could largely be explained by SNPs in INMT. The TMSe-producing women had higher U-Se concentrations than did nonproducers, but further elucidation of the metabolic pathways of selenium is essential for the understanding of its role in human health.	6.2
Finite element simulation of the mixed convection within porous square cavities for Darcy-BrinkmanForchheimer model has been carried out in the present work. The penalty optimization based Galerkin finite element method is used to solve the partial differential equations of heat and fluid flow. Bejan's heatline concept has been employed to visualize the heat flow within the closed cavities based on the motion of the horizontal wall(s) (cases la-id) or vertical wall(s) (cases 2a-2c) involving isothermally hot bottom wall, cold side walls and insulated top wall for various fluids with Prandtl number, Pr-m = 0.026, 0.7 and 7.2, Reynolds number, Re = 10-100 and Grashof number, Gr = 10(3)-10(5). The higher permeability at Da(m) >= 10(-3) leads to the enhanced buoyancy convection for all the cases. Although the direction of the motion of wall(s) significantly influences the fluid flow field within the enclosure, due to the decoupling between the fluid and thermal fields at the low Pe(m) (Pe(m) = 0.26 and 2.6), conductive heat transfer occurs as seen from the end-to-end heatlines. It is also found that the overall heat transfer rates at the bottom wall (Nu(b)) are identical for the cases 1a-id and cases 2a-2c at Pr-m = 0.026, irrespective of Gr and Re at Da(m) = 10(-2). At Pr-m = 0.7 and 7.2, the convection dominant heat transfer occurs for all the cases for Gr = 10(5), Re = 10 and 100 and Da(m) = 10(-2). The strong convective circulation cells are observed at Pr-m = 0.7 and 7.2 for all the cases. The plume shaped isotherms are also observed along the centerline at Pr-m = 7.2, Re = 10, Gr = 10(5) and Da(m) = 10(-2) for all the cases. At Pr-m = 7.2, Gr = 10(5), Da(m) = 10(-2) and. Re = 100, the multiple convective heatline cells are observed for the cases la-id. It is observed that, the strengths of fluid and heat circulation cells are less at Re = 100 compared to Re = 10 for all the cases due to weak buoyancy force at the high Re. In order to achieve the high heat transfer rate at the bottom wall (Nu(b)) for the mixed convection involving various moving walls, case 2b (a case of the vertically moving wall) is preferred at Pr-m = 0.7, Re = 100, Gr = 10(5) and Da(m) = 10(-2). At the high Pr-m (Pr-m = 7.2, Re = 100, Gr = 105 and Da(m) = 10(-2)), case 2a (a case of the vertically moving wall) is preferred based on the maximum heat transfer rate at the bottom wall (Nu(b)).

As the conventional power systems turn towards smart grids (SGs) on a fast pace, this transition may create new and significant challenges to the existing electrical network security. Along with many important features of the SGs cyber security has emerged to be a critical issue due to the interconnection of several loads, generators, and renewable resources through the communication network. Cyber-physical attacks (CPAs) are classified as the major threatening of SGs security because it may lead to severe consequences such as large blackout and destruction of infrastructures. Cyber switching attacks (CSAs) (as a part CPAs) start to attract the attention due to its severity and speed in destabilizing the SGs, we present in this paper Thyristor-Controlled Braking Resistor (TCBR) as a solution to mitigate this type of attack. TCBR can enable us to stabilize the target generator in a relatively short time.	0.2
Environmental conservation and management policy first emphasized on water pollution control in Japan. However, this kind of passive conservation policy is gradually being shifted to an active approach such as Satoumi, which includes the restoration of biodiversity, biological productivity, habitat and a well-balanced nutrient cycle between land and sea. Many Satoumi creation activities were also characterized by activities which promote interactions between land and sea. In this paper, a case study of Ago Bay in Shima City, Mie Prefecture, Japan, is introduced in which land-sea interaction at two sites was improved by promoting water exchange across dikes constructed for land development and land reclamation. Tidal flat restoration experiments conducted in Ago Bay clearly showed that the promotion of tidal exchange between the sea and wetland area on the inner side of dikes improved both deteriorated sediment quality and macro-benthos conditions. Along with the results of this case study, future tidal flat restoration in Japan is also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.4
In this paper, the authors present a polarisation dependent analytical model for DC, radio frequency (RF) and linearity characteristics of a proposed lattice-matched AlInN/AlN/GaN metal-oxide-semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (MOSHEMT). The developed model includes charge controlled analysis derived from triangular potential well approximation along with the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarisation effects. The model accurately predicts the threshold voltage, two-dimensional electron gas sheet charge density, drain current, transconductance and cut-off frequencies for different samples of gate dielectric materials such as SiO2, HfO2 and Al2O3 over a full range of gate and drain bias. A detailed analysis of the linearity characteristics by investigating the key figure-of-merit metrics such as second-order voltage intercept point, third-order voltage intercept point, third-order input intercept point and third-order intermodulation distortion are performed for different gate dielectric thicknesses of 5, 7 and 10 nm. The accuracy of the model results is verified against Silvaco Technology Computer Aided Design numerical simulation results and found to be satisfactory. It is observed that by careful tuning the device parameters such as dielectric constant and dielectric thickness, lattice-matched AlInN/AlN/GaN MOSHEMT can considerably improve the device performance and suitable for high performance low distortion RF applications.	3.0
Identifying water pollution as a crime seems only sensible and it is already characterized this way in some countries. However, to succeed in any struggle against pollution, it is important to understand what advantage such categorization provides, particularly at the international level. Speaking of environmental crimes clearly sends a message about the serious consequences such activities have for societies and for humanity. In this area, as with gross violations of human rights, criminalization may help eliminate if not impunity itself, at least the climate of impunity. But lawsuits and sanctions are effective only under precise conditions, which are sometimes difficult to meet, both in terms of the burden of proof in criminal law and in achieving the necessary political will.	4.4
Today, smart mobile devices (telephones and tablets) are very commonly used due to their powerful hardware and useful features. According to an eMarketer report, in 2014 there were 1.76 billion smartphone users (excluding users of tablets) in the world; it is predicted that this number will rise by 15.9% to 2.04 billion in 2015. It is thought that these devices can be used successfully in biomedical applications. A wireless blood pressure measuring device used together with a smart mobile device was developed in this study. By means of an interface developed for smart mobile devices with Android and iOS operating systems, a smart mobile device was used both as an indicator and as a control device. The cuff communicating with this device through Bluetooth was designed to measure blood pressure via the arm. A digital filter was used on the cuff instead of the traditional analog signal processing and filtering circuit. The newly developed blood pressure measuring device was tested on 18 patients and 20 healthy individuals of different ages under a physician's supervision. When the test results were compared with the measurements made using a sphygmomanometer, it was shown that an average 93.52% accuracy in sick individuals and 94.53% accuracy in healthy individuals could be achieved with the new device.

Object class segmentation is a computer vision task which requires labeling each pixel of an image with the class of the object it belongs to. Deep convolutional neural networks (DNN) are able to learn and take advantage of local spatial correlations required for this task. They are, however, restricted by their small, fixed-sized filters, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), on the other hand, do not suffer from this restriction. Their iterative interpretation allows them to model long-range dependencies by propagating activity. This property is especially useful when labeling video sequences, where both spatial and temporal long-range dependencies occur. In this work, a novel RNN architecture for object class segmentation is presented. We investigate several ways to train such a network. We evaluate our models on the challenging NYU Depth v2 dataset for object class segmentation and obtain competitive results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	0.0
In recent years there has been increased interest in understanding cognitive processes that playa role in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). One cognitive factor that has received little attention is rumination. Rumination, defined as the tendency to repetitively analyze ones problems and feelings of distress, has been implicated in the development and maintenance of several mood and anxiety-related disorders. Thus, the primary aim of the current study was to examine the role of rumination in OCD symptoms using an unselected treatment-seeking sample (N = 105). Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant association between rumination and the unacceptable thoughts/neutralizing domain of OCD. These findings remained significant even after accounting for a relevant and related construct, in particular negative affect. These findings support a growing body of literature establishing rumination as a transdiagnostic risk factor. Further clinical and experimental research is needed to confirm these findings and expand our knowledge of metacognitive models of OCD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.4
Manufacturers have been exploring innovative strategies to achieve and sustain their competitive advantages by facing a new era of intensive global competition. Such a strategy is Supply Chain Management (SCM), which has gained a tremendous amount of attention from both researchers and practitioners since the last decade. Supply chain management (SCM) has been considered as the most popular operations strategy for improving organizational competitiveness in the twenty-first century. It has attracted a lot of attention recently due to its role involving all of the activities in industrial organizations ranging from raw material procurement to final product delivery to customers. Well-designed supply chain systems can substantially improve efficiency and product quality, and eventually enhance customer satisfaction and profitability. In this paper, a manufacturing engineering perspective on supply chain integration is presented. Research issues discussed include product and process design for supply chain, design valuation of manufacturing supply chain, agent-based techniques for supply chain integration, intelligent information sharing across supply chain, and development of standards for product, process, and production data exchange to facilitate electronic commerce. The objective is to provide guidelines and references for manufacturing engineers and researchers that are interested in supply chain integration.	3.2
The crosstalk between NK cells and M1 macrophages has a vital role in the protection against infections and tumor development. However, macrophages in the tumor resemble an M2 phenotype, and, at present, their effect on NK cells is less clear. This study investigated whether tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have a role in altering NK cell function and phenotype using in vitro cocultures of murine NK cells with peritoneal or bone marrow-derived, M2-polarized macrophages or TAMs isolated from spontaneous mouse breast tumors. We report here that both peritoneal and bone marrow-derived M2 macrophages, as well as TAMs, substantially inhibit NK cell activation and concordant cytotoxicity against tumor cells. The mechanism for this inhibition was found to require contact between the respective cell types. Both M2 macrophages and TAMs are producers of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta. The inhibition of TGF-beta restored the cytotoxicity of NK cells in contact with M2 macrophages, implicating TGF-beta in the mechanism for NK cell inhibition. In addition to affecting NK cell function, TAMs also induced a CD27(low)CD11b(high)-exhausted NK cell phenotype, which corresponds with the reduced activation and cytotoxicity observed. This study reveals a novel implication of TAMs in the tumor-associated inhibition of NK cell function by demonstrating their capacity to directly alter NK cell cytotoxicity and phenotype in a contact-dependent mechanism involving TGF-beta. These findings identify the interaction between NK cells and TAMs as a prospective therapeutic target to enhance NK cell effector function for effective NK cell cancer therapies.	6.3
This paper presents a design assistance methodology of low speed Switched Reluctance Machines (SRM) using field-based models. The magnetic properties of the iron, the number of rotor poles, and the number of poles per phase, all play a significant role in the machine design. The proposed comparison procedure uses field-based models along with scale models, based on similarity laws, to compare SRM designs. The field-based models are here applied in dimensional analysis of regular and non-regular topologies distinguished by different characteristics of electric and magnetic circuits. As an added value for this methodology, similarity laws take into account physical phenomena like thermal changes and magnetic saturation. Hypotheses introduced in the methodology formulation were verified by finite element analysis. This work is motivated by the application of SRM to direct drive wind converters and other low speed renewable energy systems. As an application example of this methodology, a non-regular topology with short flux-paths was compared with a regular prototype, 3-phase, 12/16, SRM, designed for a direct drive wind turbine: a gain of power per unit of mass is achieved with the former one.	3.3
In social groups, individuals are often confronted with evaluations of their behaviour by other group members and are motivated to adapt their own behaviour accordingly. In two studies we examine emotional responses towards, and perceived coping abilities with, morality vs. competence evaluations individuals receive from other in-group members. In Study 1, we show that evaluations of one's immoral behaviour primarily induce guilt, whereas evaluations of incompetent behaviour raise anger. In Study 2, we elaborate on the psychological process associated with these emotional responses, and demonstrate that evaluations of immorality, compared to incompetence, diminish group members' perceived coping abilities, which in turn intensifies feelings of guilt. However, when anticipating an opportunity to restore one's self-image as a moral group member, perceived coping abilities are increased and the experience of guilt is alleviated. Together these studies demonstrate how group members can overcome their moral misery when restoring their self-image.	2.2
This paper reviews grinding research led by Professor W Brian Rowe at Liverpool John Moores University and at other establishments previously. Research reviewed extends over fundamentals of grinding processes and machine performance carried out over fifty-five years. Topics range from accuracy in centreless grinding and other grinding processes to grinding machine behaviour and high precision grinding machine design including bearing technology. Research also ranges to high removal rate grinding processes, surface integrity and intelligent process control. This review highlights progress in selected areas and demonstrates that improving product quality allows improved manufacturing productivity.	3.3
The chronic inflammation plays an important role in heart failure and complement components might be useful markers of the prognosis. We set out to evaluate their predictive value in the clinical outcomes of patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). We determined the complement levels C3, C3a, sC5b-9 and also the N-terminus of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of 126 heart failure patients in a prospective, single-center observational study before and 6 months after CRT implantation. CRT reduced the C3a [212.5 (148.2-283.6) vs. 153 (119.8-218.3) ng/mL, p165 ng/mL hazard ratio = 4.21 (1.65-10.72), p = 0.003] independent of the NT-proBNP and other factors. After reclassification, we observed a significant net reclassification improvement [NRI = 0.71 (0.43-0.98), p < 0.0001] and integrated discrimination improvement [IDI = 0.08 (0.03-0.12), p = 0.0002]. In patients with CRT, elevated C3a levels increase the risk of mortality independent of the NT-proBNP levels or other factors. CRT exerts anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the complement activation.	6.3
Eye gaze is a potent source of social information with direct eye gaze signaling the desire to approach and averted eye gaze signaling avoidance. In the current work, we proposed that eye gaze signals whether or not to impute minds into others. Across four studies, we manipulated targets' eye gaze (i.e., direct vs. averted eye gaze) and measured explicit mind ascriptions (Study 1a, Study 1b, and Study 2) and beliefs about the likelihood of targets having mind (Study 3). In all four studies, we find novel evidence that the ascription of sophisticated humanlike minds to others is signaled by the display of direct eye gaze relative to averted eye gaze. Moreover, we provide evidence suggesting that this differential mentalization is due, at least in part, to beliefs that direct gaze targets are more likely to instigate social interaction. In short, eye contact triggers mind perception.	2.2
Comparing with ITER, the experimental fusion machine under construction, the next-step test fusion power plant, DEMOwill be characterized by a very long pulse/steady-state operation and much higher plasma volume and fusion power. The substantially increased level of neutron and gamma fluxes will require reducing the physical access to the plant. It means some conventional diagnostics for the fusion plasma control will not be suitable in DEMO. Development of diagnostics along with the machine design is a primary task for the test plant. The deuterium-tritium fuel ratio and temperature are among important parameters, which should be under control. In this paper, a novel technique for the core fuel ratio and temperature diagnostics is proposed. It is based on measurements and comparison of the rates T (p, gamma)(4) He and D(T, gamma)(5) He nuclear reactions that take place in the hot deuterium-tritium plasma. Based on detection of high-energy gamma-rays, this diagnostic is robust, efficient and does not require direct access to the plasma. It could be included in the loop of the burning plasma control system. A feasibility of the diagnostic in experiments on JET and ITER is also discussed.	3.3
The space-time fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation is solved by mean of on the fractional Riccati expansion method. These solutions include generalized trigonometric and hyperbolic functions which could be useful for further understanding of mechanisms of the complicated nonlinear physical phenomena and fractional differential equations. Among these solutions, some are found for the first time.	3.4
Goal understanding is the process by which interactants make inferences about others' objectives during conversation. Previous research has examined goal understanding without concern for the timing of goal pursuit. Accordingly, an experiment examined the timing of pursuers' efficiency in the communicative behavior employed to reach their goal. Results indicated that timing modified the relationship between pursuers' efficiency and detectors' accuracy and to a lesser extent detectors' certainty. Efficiency was positively correlated with accuracy for the initial minute of a 5-minute interaction but not subsequent minutes.	2.2
A new look at the description of the phenomenon of electromagnetic wave radiation as a phase transition of a quasi-static field state (near zone) in the field of running wave (far zone) is suggested. It is demonstrated that the boundary of this transition, called the causal surface, is sufficiently localized. The position of the causal surface depends on the chosen radiation frequency. The skin layer in media with strong absorption is formed at the boundary of the causal surface, and this can be used for depth sensing of such media.	4.2
Background: Gal d 1 (ovomucoid) is the dominant allergen in the chicken egg white. Hypoallergenic variants of this allergen can be used in immunotherapy as an egg allergy treatment approach. We hypothesised that disruption of two of the nine cysteine-cysteine bridges by site-directed mutagenesis will allow the production of a hypoallergenic variant of the protein; Methods: Two cysteine residues at C192 and C210 in domain III of the protein were mutated to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis, to disrupt two separate cysteine-cysteine bridges. The mutated and non-mutated proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) by induction with isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The expressed proteins were analysed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting to confirm expression. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity of the two proteins was analysed, by immunoblotting, against a pool of egg-allergic patients' sera. A pool of non-allergic patients' sera was also used in a separate blot as a negative control; Results: Mutant Gal d 1 showed diminished IgE reactivity in the immunoblot by showing lighter bands when compared to the non-mutated version, although there was more of the mutant protein immobilised on the membrane when compared to the wild-type protein. The non-allergic negative control showed no bands, indicating an absence of non-specific binding of secondary antibody to the proteins; Conclusion: Disruption of two cysteine bridges in domain III of Gal d 1 reduces IgE reactivity. Following downstream laboratory and clinical testing, this mutant protein can be used in immunotherapy to induce tolerance to Gal d 1 and in egg allergy diagnosis.	5.1
Couched in the context of the experience economy 3.0, this research conceptualized transformations as changes in existential authenticity and anxiety, and phenomenologically explored the essence of a transformative tourist experience and subsequent long-term changes. This research uncovered nine chronologically ordered themes in which existentially oriented concerns were prevalent. It found that tourists did not reflect on existential givens in situ until a triggering episode initiated the meaning-making process. Existential anxiety felt post-trip was found to motivate tourists to resolve pertinent existential dilemmas and to initiate meaningful life changes. Participants sustained enhanced existential authenticity and became more sensitive to existential anxiety in their lives thereafter.	5.4
This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes towards the religious out-group. It uses unique survey data collected by the authors among Christian and Muslim students in Maluku and Yogyakarta (Indonesia) and Mindanao and Metro Manila (the Philippines). Even after taking self-selection effects into account, interreligious friendships reduce negative attitudes towards the religious out-group. However, casual interreligious contact increases negative out-group attitudes. Also individuals who experienced interreligious violence have more negative out-group attitudes than those without such experience. The experience of interreligious violence has no influence on the effect of interreligious friendships but it further deteriorates the relationship between casual interreligious contact and out-group attitudes. Perceived group threat is an important mechanism explaining the effects of both positive and negative interreligious contact. [125]. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.0
High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) can generate more secure bits for one detection event so that it can achieve long distance key distribution with a high secret key capacity. In this Letter, we present a decoy state HD-QKD scheme with the entangled single-photon-added coherent state (ESPACS) source. We present two tight formulas to estimate the single-photon fraction of postselected events and Eve's Holevo information and derive lower bounds on the secret key capacity and the secret key rate of our protocol. We also present finite-key analysis for our protocol by using the Chernoff bound. Our numerical results show that our protocol using one decoy state can perform better than that of previous HD-QKD protocol with the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) using two decoy states. Moreover, when considering finite resources, the advantage is more obvious. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.3
Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful technique for studying the diffusion of molecules within biological membranes with high spatial and temporal resolution. FCS can quantify the molecular concentration and diffusion coefficient of fluorescently labeled molecules in the cell membrane. This technique has the ability to explore the molecular diffusion characteristics of molecules in the plasma membrane of immune cells in steady state (i.e., without processes affecting the result during the actual measurement time). FCS is suitable for studying the diffusion of proteins that are expressed at levels typical for most endogenous proteins. Here, a straightforward and robust method to determine the diffusion rate of cell membrane proteins on primary lymphocytes is demonstrated. An effective way to perform measurements on antibody-stained live cells and commonly occurring observations after acquisition are described. The recent advancements in the development of photostable fluorescent dyes can be utilized by conjugating the antibodies of interest to appropriate dyes that do not bleach extensively during the measurements. Additionally, this allows for the detection of slowly diffusing entities, which is a common feature of proteins expressed in cell membranes. The analysis procedure to extract molecular concentration and diffusion parameters from the generated autocorrelation curves is highlighted. In summary, a basic protocol for FCS measurements is provided; it can be followed by immunologists with an understanding of confocal microscopy but with no other previous experience of techniques for measuring dynamic parameters, such as molecular diffusion rates.	6.3
Anxiety disorders are one of the most common and debilitating mental illnesses worldwide. Growing evidence indicates an age-dependent rise in the incidence of anxiety disorders from adolescence through adulthood, suggestive of underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are known to contribute to the development and expression of anxiety; however, the functional role of KORs in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain structure critical in mediating anxiety, particularly across ontogeny, are unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent (postnatal day (P) 30-45) and adult (P60+) male Sprague-Dawley rats, we found that the KOR agonist, U69593, increased the frequency of GABA(A)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in the adolescent BLA, without an effect in the adult BLA or on sIPSC amplitude at either age. The KOR effect was blocked by the KOR antagonist, nor-BNI, which alone did not alter GABA transmission at either age, and the effect of the KOR agonist was TTX-sensitive. Additionally, KOR activation did not alter glutamatergic transmission in the BLA at either age. In contrast, U69593 inhibited sIPSC frequency in the central amygdala (CeA) at both ages, without altering sIPSC amplitude. Western blot analysis of KOR expression indicated that KOR levels were not different between the two ages in either the BLA or CeA. This is the first study to provide compelling evidence for a novel and unique neuromodulatory switch in one of the primary brain regions involved in initiating and mediating anxiety that may contribute to the ontogenic rise in anxiety disorders.

The manufacturing technology of high power laser optical elements belongs to the typical extreme manufacturing engineering for its high precision, low defect, more outputs and less cost. In order to resolve the bottleneck of the current manufacturing, this paper introduces a cloud manufacturing service mode oriented high power laser optical elements to realize the digital engineering management within optical product life cycle, and discusses the architecture and some key techniques in this new mode. This cloud manufacturing service mode can allocate the manufacturing resources and capabilities properly, and provide a managing mechanism which is used as need and paid according to need to utilize different resource services anywhere. It is useful for the manufacture of high power laser optical elements to improve manufacturing precision, optical damage resistance threshold and production efficiency.	3.2
The whole world is evolving very fast, and of course technology is being innovated very quickly as well. Vision in 2020, as the main theme of the conference said, sounds like the far future. But five years is not such a long time, nevertheless technical possibilities are increasing dramatically. That is why it is necessary to think about the future, to plan the future and to have some vision. And this whole process starts in education. Young and innovative people are the most effective choice for an employer, and can meet objectives more rapidly. But they need to have the necessary education. New models, an intense focus on the student experience, and a drive for innovation and entrepreneurism will ensure that higher education continues to meet society's needs. (Educase 2010) It is very important for students to deal with real problems during their studies, such as projects coming from local companies. Students must have high-quality study materials which come from real projects from industry. Few students would study engineering without expecting their education to help them prepare for engineering work. (Male 2010) Sometimes we can see lectures are supported by twenty year old materials and it is necessary to change, because if it takes graduates from technical faculties months or years until they are able to work independently and to be beneficial for society, the efficiency of the education is at a low level.	3.3
Due to their high power density and high overall efficiency permanent magnet excited synchronous machines are beneficial to be applied in traction drives of full electric or hybrid-electric vehicles with limited installation space. To improve the performance, additional flux-barriers can be inserted to the rotor of the machine. In this paper, the effects of different flux-barrier positions and sizes are systematically studied. Command variables for the improvement are average torque, torque ripple, total harmonic distortion of the back-emf, iron losses and efficiency.	3.3
The present study examined whether bullying, defending, and outsider behaviors in preschool children were associated with two conscience aspects (empathic concern and internalization of rules) and with emotion understanding. We also investigated whether emotion understanding moderated the relationship between these dimensions and bullying roles. Participants were 105 children (51 males), aged 36 to 76 months. Bullying roles were assessed through peer nominations. Internalization of rules and empathic concern were observed in classroom and their scores derived from selected Q-Sort items. Emotion understanding was evaluated with the Puppet Interview administered to children. Results showed that empathic concern and internalization of rules were negatively associated with bullying and outsider behaviors, whereas emotion understanding correlated with defending behavior. The interaction between emotion understanding and internalization of rules was also significant: Low scores on rule-compatible conduct were associated with bullying or outsider behavior, in particular for those children with poor emotion understanding.	2.4
Objectives. To evaluate the impact and risk factors associated with an abnormal exercise test ( ET) in systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease ( SIRD) patients before commencing supervised physical exercise. Methods. A total of 235 SIRD patients were enrolled in three controlled clinical trials, including 103 RA, 42 SLE and 57 AS patients. The control group consisted of 231 healthy, sedentary subjects matched for age, gender and BMI. All performed an ET, according to Bruce's or Ellestad's protocol. Cardiovascular disease risk factors, medications, comorbidities and details of each SIRD were assessed. Results. SIRD patients had a higher percentage of abnormal ETs compared with the control group, especially exercise hypertensive behaviour, higher oxygen consumption, higher resting heart rate and heart rate at the first minute of recovery, and chronotropic incompetence (C-Inc) (P < 0.001). The disease itself was involved with higher likelihood of having an abnormal ET [Odds ratio (OR) = 12.0, 95% CI: 2.5, 56.7; P = 0.002 for SLE; OR = 13.56, 95% CI: 6.16, 29.8; P < 0.001 for RA; and OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 1.17, 15.8; P = 0.028, for AS]. Each 10-year increment of age increased the chance of having an abnormal ET by 13% (P = 0.008) in AS patients, as well as hypertension (OR = 7.14, 95% CI: 1.61, 31.6; P = 0.01). Regarding C-Inc, age played a protective role (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.99; P = 0.043) in SLE, and ASDAS-ESR was associated with a higher risk in AS (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 0.93, 8.0; P = 0.067). Conclusion. Our results showed a higher prevalence of abnormal ETs in asymptomatic cardiovascular SIRD patients, and the disease itself was associated with a higher likelihood of having an abnormal test, emphasizing the relevance and need of performing it before starting supervised physical exercise.	5.3
Objective: The disclosure of medical errors has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. However, the research to date has lacked interdisciplinary dialog, making translation of findings into medical practice challenging. This article lays out the disciplinary perspectives of the fields of medicine, ethics, law and communication on medical error disclosure and identifies gaps and tensions that occur at these interdisciplinary boundaries. Methods: This article summarizes the discussion of an interdisciplinary error disclosure panel at the 2012 EACH Conference in St. Andrews, Scotland, in light of the current literature across four academic disciplines. Results: Current medical, ethical, legal and communication perspectives on medical error disclosure are presented and discussed with particular emphasis on the interdisciplinary gaps and tensions. Conclusion: The authors encourage interdisciplinary collaborations that strive for a functional approach to understanding and improving the disclosure of medical errors with the ultimate goal to improve quality and promote safer medical care. Practice implications: Interdisciplinary collaborations are needed to reconcile the needs of the stakeholders involved in medical error disclosure. A particular challenge is the effective translation of error disclosure research into practice. Concrete research questions are provided throughout the manuscript to facilitate a resolution of the tensions that currently impede interdisciplinary progress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Background: Component resolved allergen diagnosis allows for a precise evaluation of the sensitization profiles of patients sensitized to felines and canines. An accurate interpretation of these results allows better insight into the evolution of a given patients sensitizations, and allows for a more precise evaluation of their prognoses. Methods: 70 patients (42 women and 28 men, aged 18-65, with the average of 35.5) with a positive feline or canine allergy diagnosis were included in the research group. 30 patients with a negative allergy diagnosis were included in the control group. The total IgE levels of all patients with allergies as well as their allergen-specific IgE to feline and canine allergens were measured. Specific IgE levels to canine (Can f 1, Can f 2, Can f 3, Can f 5) and feline (Fel d 1, Fel d 2, Fel d 4) allergen components were also measured with the use of the ImmunoCap method. Results: Monosensitization for only one canine or feline component was found in 30% of patients. As predicted, the main feline allergen was Fel d 1, which sensitized as many as 93.9% of patients sensitized to felines. Among 65 patients sensitized to at least one feline component, for 30 patients (46.2%) the only sensitizing feline component was Fel d 1. Only 19 patients in that group (63.3%) were not simultaneously sensitized to dogs and 11 (36.7%), the isolated sensitization to feline Fel d 1 notwithstanding, displayed concurrent sensitizations to one of the canine allergen components. Fel d 4 sensitized 49.2% of the research group. 64.3% of patients sensitized to canine components had heightened levels of specific IgE to Can f 1. Monosensitization in that group occurred for 32.1% of the patients. Sensitization to Can f 5 was observed among 52.4% of the patients. Conclusions: Concurrent sensitizations to a few allergic components, not only cross-reactive but also originating in different protein families, are a significant problem for patients sensitized to animals.	5.1
Multi-slice methods allow us to approximate the 3D phenomena without carrying out a full 3D analysis, e. g. in skewed radial flux electrical machines. The idea is to divide a 3D machine into several 2D FEM models, only connected by electrical circuits. Here we show how the multi-slice method is perfect for parallel computation; the computation efficiency is close to that of 2D models in modern parallel hardware. The results are shown to match with 3D computation and experimental results.	1.2
Tree species information is essential for forest research and management purposes, which in turn require approaches for accurate and precise classification of tree species. One such remote sensing technology, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), has proved to be capable of characterizing detailed tree structures, such as tree stem geometry. Can TLS further differentiate between broad- and needle-leaves? If the answer is positive, TLS data can be used for classification of taxonomic tree groups by directly examining their differences in leaf morphology. An analysis was proposed to assess TLS-represented broad- and needle-leaf structures, followed by a Bayes classifier to perform the classification. Tests indicated that the proposed method can basically implement the task, with an overall accuracy of 77.78%. This study indicates a way of implementing the classification of the two major broad- and needle-leaf taxonomies measured by TLS in accordance to their literal definitions, and manifests the potential of extending TLS applications in forestry.

The current study aims to evaluate the capabilities of soil water balance modeling to estimate ET for very different conditions of rainfed grapevine water status, within a vineyard landscape that depicts heterogeneities in canopy, soil and water table conditions. We calibrated the HYDRUS-1D model against measurements of the soil moisture profile within seven contrasted sites, we validated HYDRUS-1D sim-ulations against ET estimates derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements within two contrasted sites, and we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the HYDRUS-1D ET simulations throughout almost two growth cycles for the seven sites. The calibration of HYDRUS-1D was correctly achieved, with a relative RMSE of 20% on average. Validation of HYDRUS-1D simulations against EC measurements was satisfactory, with RMSE values of about 40W m(-2) at the hourly timescale and 0.5 mm d(-1) at the daily timescale. HYDRUS-1D was able to provide consistent time series of ET within the seven contrasted sites and throughout the two growth cycles. We conclude that HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used as an alternative to EC measurements within rainfed vineyards, to alleviate experimental efforts for device cost and maintenance. Further, HYDRUS-1D simulations can be used for characterizing spatial variabili-ties and temporal dynamics, assessing impact of pedological conditions and land use on ET, or validating remote sensing retrievals over regional extents.

Substrate and cell patterning techniques are widely used in cell biology to study cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate interactions. Conventional patterning techniques work well only with simple shapes, small areas and selected bio-materials. This article describes a method to distribute cell suspensions as well as substrate solutions into complex, long, closed (dead-end) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels using negative pressure. This method enables researchers to pattern multiple substrates including fibronectin, collagen, antibodies (Sal-1), poly-D-lysine (PDL), and laminin. Patterning of substrates allows one to indirectly pattern a variety of cells. We have tested C2C12 myoblasts, the PC12 neuronal cell line, embryonic rat cortical neurons, and amphibian retinal neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that this technique can directly pattern fibroblasts in microfluidic channels via brief application of a low vacuum on cell suspensions. The low vacuum does not significantly decrease cell viability as shown by cell viability assays. Modifications are discussed for application of the method to different cell and substrate types. This technique allows researchers to pattern cells and proteins in specific patterns without the need for exotic materials or equipment and can be done in any laboratory with a vacuum.	6.1
Quercetin, a polyphenol with potential health effects, is absorbed by humans and measurement in plasma can be used as a biomarker for intake. However, the chemical nature of the quercetin in blood is still not known, although one possibility is that glucosides are found in an unchanged form from the original food. We propose that the existence of quercetin glucosides in plasma is unlikely, since the metabolic beta -glucosidase capacity of the small intestine and of the liver is too great for quercetin glucosides to escape deglycosylation. We critically examine the limited number of studies which purport to detect quercetin glycosides in blood and the current evidence for the absorption of these compounds from the gastrointestinal tract. We emphasise the need for comprehensive identification of circulating compounds, since polyphenol glucuronides, the expected metabolites in plasma, have almost identical chromatographic properties to the glucosides at acid pH. Studies on the nature of quercetin metabolites in plasma are urgently needed so that the proposed biological activities of quercetin can be re-assessed and that a suitable biomarker of exposure can be established.	6.2
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an important vertebrate model organism in biomedical research, especially suitable for morphological screening due to its transparent body during early development. Deep learning has emerged as a dominant paradigm for data analysis and found a number of applications in computer vision and image analysis. Here we demonstrate the potential of a deep learning approach for accurate high-throughput classification of whole-body zebrafish deformations in multifish microwell plates. Deep learning uses the raw image data as an input, without the need of expert knowledge for feature design or optimization of the segmentation parameters. We trained the deep learning classifier on as few as 84 images (before data augmentation) and achieved a classification accuracy of 92.8% on an unseen test data set that is comparable to the previous state of the art (95%) based on user-specified segmentation and deformation metrics. Ablation studies by digitally removing whole fish or parts of the fish from the images revealed that the classifier learned discriminative features from the image foreground, and we observed that the deformations of the head region, rather than the visually apparent bent tail, were more important for good classification performance.	0.0
Hypervisors enable cloud computing model to provide scalable infrastructures and on-demand access to computing resources as they support multiple operating systems to run on one physical server concurrently. This mechanism enhances utilization of physical server thus reduces server count in the data center. Hypervisors also drive the benefits of reduced IT infrastructure setup and maintenance costs along with power savings. It is interesting to know different hypervisors' performance for the consolidated application workloads. Three hypervisors ESXi, XenServer, and KVM are carefully chosen to represent three categories full virtualized, para-virtualized, and hybrid virtualized respectively for the experiment. We have created a private cloud using CloudStack. Hypervisors are deployed as hosts in the private cloud in the respective clusters. Each hypervisor is deployed with three virtual machines. Three applications web server, application server, and database servers are installed on three virtual machines. Experiments are designed using Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology. With concurrently running virtual machines, each hypervisor is stressed with the consolidated real-time workloads (web load, application load, and OLTP) and important system information is gathered using SIGAR framework. The paper proposes a new scoring formula for hypervisors' performance in the private cloud for consolidated application workloads and the accuracy of the results are complemented with sound statistical analysis using DOE.

In vertebrates, many responses to stress as well as homeostatic maintenance of basal metabolism are regulated by plasma glucocorticoid hormones (GCs). Despite having crucial functions, levels of GCs are typically variable among individuals. We examined the contribution of several physiological factors to individual variation in plasma corticosterone (CORT) and the number of corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the magnocellular preoptic area of the brain in free-living Allegheny Mountain dusky salamanders. We addressed three hypotheses: the current-condition hypothesis, the facilitation hypothesis and the trade-off hypothesis. Differential white blood cell count was identified as a strong contributor to individual variation in baseline CORT, stress-induced CORT and the number of CRH neurons. In contrast, we found no relationship between CORT (or CRH) and body condition, energy stores or reproductive investment, providing no support for the current-condition hypothesis or the tradeoff hypothesis involving reproduction. Because of the difficulties of interpreting the functional consequences of variation in differential white blood cell counts, we were unable to distinguish between the facilitation hypothesis or the trade-off hypothesis related to immune function. However, the strong association between differential white blood cell count and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal (HPA/I) activation suggests that a more thorough examination of immune profiles is critical to understanding variation in HPA/I activation.	6.3
The development of precision agriculture demands high accuracy and efficiency of cultivated land information extraction. As a new means of monitoring the ground in recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low-height remote sensing technique, which is flexible, efficient with low cost and with high resolution, is widely applied to investing various resources. Based on this, a novel extraction method for cultivated land information based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning (DTCLE) was proposed. First, linear features (roads and ridges etc.) were excluded based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Next, feature extraction method learned from DCNN was used to cultivated land information extraction by introducing transfer learning mechanism. Last, cultivated land information extraction results were completed by the DTCLE and eCognition for cultivated land information extraction (ECLE). The location of the Pengzhou County and Guanghan County, Sichuan Province were selected for the experimental purpose. The experimental results showed that the overall precision for the experimental image 1, 2 and 3 (of extracting cultivated land) with the DTCLE method was 91.7%, 88.1% and 88.2% respectively, and the overall precision of ECLE is 90.7%, 90.5% and 87.0%, respectively. Accuracy of DTCLE was equivalent to that of ECLE, and also outperformed ECLE in terms of integrity and continuity.	4.2
The study aims to discuss the criminalization processes of the cultural manifestations of brazilian funk, especially in the context of the city of Porto Alegre / RS, from its more expressive representation called Baile Funk da Tuka. Therefore, it focuses on a political-historical memory about crime linked to a hunt of the samba-funk to current formation of refractory punitive ethos of proibidoesas cultural manifestation. Thus, one can reach the local stage, through semistructured interviews with the regulars of these bailes, MCs that lead the meetings, as well as with the military police responsible for the ostensible policing in the region. The criticism built is the result of discourse analysis of these social actors, focused on participant intervention dialogues, which endows the work only outlines the perspective of getting the punitive power by suprise in its forceful dynamics of inequality, often prone to turn prejudice and stigmatization as naturalized products of violence and social exclusion.	2.0
For a fully digital control of PWM converters, considerable research has been done based on the predictive current control (PCC) scheme. However, it requires a large amount of calculation in the step of experimental implementation. Besides, when compared with the classical linear control scheme, the sampling interval of the PCC scheme must be shorter to obtain the same control performance for current. Due to this, a digital signal processor with excellent performance is required. This paper proposes an improved simplified model PCC scheme for three-phase PWM converters. The main objective is to simplify the PCC scheme. Also, the proposed control scheme is able to reduce the calculation time without affecting the performance. Simulations and experiments are carried out to investigate the presented novel predictive current control scheme. The results indicate that the three-phase PWM converter has excellent static and dynamic performance with the proposed scheme. Besides, the calculation time can be obviously shortened.	1.4
Introduction: Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening pregnancy disorder characterized by wide-spread endothelial dysfunction. Placental factors circulating in the maternal blood are believed to cause endothelial dysfunction. Our previous study identified HtrA4 as a placenta-specific serine protease that is released into the maternal circulation and significantly increased in early-onset PE. In this study, we examined the impact of HtrA4 on expression of endothelial genes related to vessel biology, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model. Methods: HUVECs were treated with 0 or 3 mu g/ml HtrA4 (highest concentration seen in PE circulation) for 24 h and analysed by an endothelial cell biology PCR array containing 84 genes. HtrA4-induced changes were then validated by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA for time and dose dependency. Results: High levels of HtrA4 significantly altered the expression of a range of genes related to inflammation, vaso-activity, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, platelet activation and coagulation. In particular, pro inflammatory genes 1L6, PTGS2 (COX2) and MB were significantly increased by HtrA4. IL6 protein in HUVEC media was also drastically increased. THBD, an anticoagulant factor reported to be increased in PE, was significantly up-regulated by HtrA4. In contrast, THBS1, which is involved in many regulatory processes of endothelial cell biology, was severely down-regulated by HtrA4. Discussion: HtrA4 significantly increased the inflammatory responses of HUVECs, and altered their expression of a number of genes important for vessel biology. These data suggest that placenta-derived HtrA4 that is increased in PE circulation is a potential causal factor of endothelial dysfunction. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	6.1
Particularly in the automotive industry, the combination of dissimilar materials presents manufacturing engineering with major challenges. Notably, the adapted use of plastic and metal opens up further potential for weight savings. Directly and firmly bonding the two materials together fails, however, on account of the chemical and physical dissimilarity of plastic and metal. Since joining of plastics and metals nowadays is based on adhesive bonding, the joint is weak and underlies ageing processes. A promising approach to overcome these problems is a laser based two-step process. In the first process step laser radiation is applied to generate microstructures on the surface of the metallic joining partner. In the subsequent laser joining process, the plastic is molten and interlocked into the microstructures after curing. The mechanical strength of the joint depends strongly on the load direction and can be influenced by the geometry and arrangement of microstructures. These influencing factors are investigated for three different load directions (tensile shear, tensile and peel) by experiments and by structural mechanics simulations.	3.2
The use of smart devices is increasing rapidly; this trend is changing the paradigm in which notifications are delivered to users. Smart devices are important to provide user awareness. However, their use must be controlled and human perception should be considered to avoid information overload. In this paper, we present a dynamic mechanism to coordinate the distribution of notification across smart devices. This personalized notification mechanism uses an inference engine and a set of rules to generate notification alternatives and select the best one. A continuous refinement approach is also used to improve notification delivery. Our system was evaluated and the baseline rules were established by 11 expert users. The main results show that in some scenarios, the notification mechanism selection converged quickly and results are promising. However, further work is required to provide not only personalized but integrated (i.e., more than one device at the time) notification management.	4.0
Gut microbiota play key roles in host nutrition and metabolism. However, little is known about the relationship between host genetics, gut microbiota and metabolic profiles. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry approaches to characterize the microbiota composition and the metabolite profiles in the gut of five cyprinid fish species with three different feeding habits raised under identical husbandry conditions. Our results showed that host species and feeding habits significantly affect not only gut microbiota composition but also metabolite profiles (ANOSIM, p <= 0.05). Mantel test demonstrated that host phylogeny, gut microbiota, and metabolite profiles were significantly related to each other (p <= 0.05). Additionally, the carps with the same feeding habits had more similarity in gut microbiota composition and metabolite profiles. Various metabolites were correlated positively with bacterial taxa involved in food degradation. Our results shed new light on the microbiome and metabolite profiles in the gut content of cyprinid fishes, and highlighted the correlations between host genotype, fish gut microbiome and putative functions, and gut metabolite profiles.	6.4
The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) is a filter-collector macroinvertebrate species originating from southern China. It easily invades water transfer tunnels and attaches onto tunnel walls and structures with extremely high density, resulting in biofouling, pipe clogging, structure corrosion, a decrease in water transfer efficiency, and water pollution. It has become a prevalent problem and has caused concern all over the world. However, an effective and environment friendly method of controlling golden mussel invasion has not yet been approved. This study is aimed to propose measures for preventing golden mussel invasion and biofouling in the water transfer tunnels of the East River Water Source Project (ERWSP), which transfers water from the East River to Shenzhen, southern China for 10 million people. Long-term samplings and observations of the East River water were performed to study the golden mussel's invading pattern. Flume experiments were done to study the golden mussel's attachment on 14 different materials and performance in turbulent flows. An integrated ecological prevention pool was designed and constructed based on the flume experimental results for preventing the golden mussel invasion in the scale model tunnels of the ERWSP. The major technology of the ecological pool was preventing the golden mussel from entering the tunnels by attracting veligers to attach on geotextile cloth, attracting mussels to attach on bamboo, and killing veligers with high-frequency turbulence. An eight-month application experiment showed that the ecological pool successfully controlled the golden mussel invasion and biofouling in the scale model tunnels. The mussel density on the attachment materials decreased sharply as the distance of the materials from the pool entrance increased; the turbulence was effective in killing veligers that escaped from the attachment materials. No mussel was found on the model tunnels. Thus, the integrated ecological prevention pool is recommended as a successful measure for controlling the golden mussel invasion and biofouling in water transfer tunnels.

Utilisation of submerged vanes in front of intake ports is an effective approach to address sedimentation in lateral intakes from rivers. Strategically installed, these flow-training structures could increase the mid-depth and near surface flows into the intake, and simultaneously prevent bed-load transport from entering the intake channels. The effectiveness of submerged vanes depends on their number, shape, dimensions and configuration. Determination of optimum values for dimensions or configuration of the vanes is very challenging as the effect of many parameters, which are effective in sedimentation in the intake zone, must be investigated. In this study, effort has been made to determine appropriate dimensions of submerged vanes that are installed in front of a 90 degrees intake from a straight channel. Fuzzy TOPSIS, a multi-objective optimisation method, has been utilised for the optimisation process by considering ten parameters. The simulations have been conducted for three discharge ratios of 0.11, 0.16 and 0.21. The results show that a height of 0.2 times the flow depth, and a length of four times the vane height are the appropriate dimensions for utilisation of submerged vanes in front of the lateral intakes from straight channels.	3.1
Morality is a prominent guide of both action and perception. We argue that non-emotional gestures can prime the abstract concept of honesty. Four studies demonstrated that the emblematic gesture associated with honesty (putting a hand on one's heart) increased the level of honesty perceived by others, and increased the honesty shown in one's own behavior. Target persons performing this gesture were described in terms associated with honesty, and appeared more trustworthy to others than when the same targets were photographed with a control gesture. Persons performing the hand-over-heart gesture provided more honest assessments of others' attractiveness, and refrained from cheating, as compared to persons performing neutral gestures. These findings suggest that bodily experience associated with abstract concepts can influence both one's perceptions of others, and one's own complex actions. Further, our findings suggest that this influence is not mediated by changes in affective states.	2.2
This paper presents the design of a high-performance 14-pole, 12-slot interior permanent magnet synchronous machine with flux barriers inside the stator iron core and fractional-slot concentrated windings. This work focuses on electromagnetic, mechanical and thermal aspects of the machine design. The specific goal of this work was to design an electrical machine, which will have a small size, high power-to-weight ratio, high efficiency, especially at part-load operating points, and high speed capability for traction drive applications. Therefore the unconventional stator design is used. The proposed machine design was compared with the conventional one, concerning the magnetic saturation, spectrum of the magneto-motive force and produced torque. To ensure the high speed capability of the motor, the numerical structural analysis of the rotor is shown. Temperature behavior inside of the designed motor at steady-state operating point is shown.	3.3
Airborne Lidar bathymetry (ALB) is an effective and a rapidly advancing technology for mapping and characterizing shallow coastal water zones as well as inland fresh-water basins such as rivers and lakes. The ability of light beams to detect and traverse shallow water columns has provided valuable information about unmapped and often poorly understood coastal and inland water bodies of the world. Estimating ALB survey results at varying water clarity and depth conditions is essential for realizing project expectations and preparing budgets accordingly. In remote locations of the world where in situ water clarity measurements are not feasible or possible, using multiband satellite imagery can be an effective tool for estimating and addressing such considerations. For this purpose, we studied and classified reflected electromagnetic energy from selected water bodies acquired by RapidEye sensor and then correlated findings with ALB survey results. This study was focused not on accurately measuring depth from optical bathymetry but rather on using multiband satellite imagery to quickly predict ALB survey results and identify potentially turbid water bodies with limited depth penetration. For this study, we constructed an in-house algorithm to confirm ALB survey findings using bathymetric waveform information. The study findings are expected to contribute to the ongoing understanding of forecasting ALB survey expectations in unknown and varying water conditions, especially in remote and inaccessible parts of the world.

The adverse environmental impacts associated with a very high nitrate concentration is undesirable due to their extremely toxicity to most aquatic species and human, include also a strongly promotion of eutrophication. Different methods are developed to eliminate this water pollution, so the use of the denitrifying bacteria, is the ideal solution thanks to its low cost and low energy consumption. In this study, we performed the isolation of bacteria from activated sludge. The best denitrifying bacteria selected was incubated in a bioreactor containing a synthetic wastewater rich in nitrate ions. The Griess test (NR1 + NR2) and zinc powder were proved the denitrification capacity of this strain, which had the ability of the complete reduction until the last stage passing through nitrite to atmospheric nitrogen, which gave also a reduction percentage of 75% with a significant growth rate. Finally the bacterium was tested both in microscope and in biochemical gallery.	4.4
The neural basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not yet understood. ASD is marked by social deficits and is strongly associated with cerebellar abnormalities. We studied the organization and cerebellar connectivity of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), an area that plays a crucial role in social cognition. We applied localized independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data from autistic and neurotypical adolescents to yield an unbiased parcellation of the bilateral TPJ into 11 independent components (ICs). A comparison between neurotypical and autistic adolescents showed that the organization of the TPJ was not significantly altered in ASD. Second, we used the time courses of the TPJ ICs as spatially unbiased seeds for a functional connectivity analysis applied to voxels within the cerebellum. We found that the cerebellum contained a fine-grained, lateralized map of the TPJ. The connectivity of the TPJ subdivisions with cerebellar zones showed one striking difference in ASD. The right dorsal TPJ showed markedly less connectivity with the left Crus II. Disturbed cerebellar input to this key region for cognition and multimodal integration may contribute to social deficits in ASD. The findings might also suggest that the right TPJ and/or left Crus II are potential targets for noninvasive brain stimulation therapies.	2.1
Background: There are many ways to treat focal hyperhidrosis, including surgeries for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. However, doctors and patients tend to be reluctant to perform surgery for plantar hyperhidrosis due to misconceptions and prejudices about surgical treatment. In addition, few studies have reported the outcome of surgeries for plantar hyperhidrosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the outcome (early and late postoperative satisfaction, complication, compensatory hyperhidrosis, recurrence rate, and efficiency) of surgical treatment for plantar hyperhidrosis. Materials and Methods: From August 2014 to October 2015, lumbar sympathetic block (LSB) was performed in 82 patients with plantar hyperhidrosis using clipping method. Limited video-assisted LSB was performed using 5mm ligamax-clip or 3mm horizontal-clip after identifying L3-4 sympathetic ganglion through finger-touch and endoscopic vision. Results: Of the 82 patients, 45 were male and 37 were female. Their mean age was 26.38 years (range, 14-51 years). Mean follow-up time was 6.60 - 3.56 months. Mean early postoperative satisfaction score was 9.6 on the 10th day postoperative evaluation. At more than 1 month later, the mean late postoperative satisfaction score was 9.2. There was no significant difference in early postoperative satisfaction score between clipping level L3 and L4/5. However, late postoperative satisfaction score was significantly better in the L3 group than that in the L4/5 group. Patient's age and body mass index did not affect the satisfaction score. However, male patients and patients who had history of hyperhidrosis operation showed higher satisfaction score than others. Conclusion: Limited video-assisted LSB using clip provided good results with minimal complications and low compensatory hidrosis, contrary to the prejudice toward it. Therefore, surgical treatment is recommended for plantar hyperhidrosis.	2.0
Food security is the main concern of government due to malnutrition worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess macronutrients and amino acids in five species of grasshoppers, consumed in rural and urban communities. Samples were captured in different agro climatic environment conditions, wherever vegetation grows, and the macronutrients were raw, analyzed in dry basis by the AOAC methods and amino acids by cation exchange chromatography. The obtained data showed a high protein content, ranging from 70% to 75%; lipids 4% to 6%; minerals 3% to 5%; fiber 6% to 8% and soluble carbohydrates 6% to 18%, including essential amino acids that play an important role in human metabolism, with tryptophan as limiting factor. The different species of the studied grasshoppers are high in proteins, essential macromolecules for human life that decrease protein-energy malnutrition; the excess of amino acids after releasing the amino group will provide energy, as well as soluble carbohydrates. They also have minerals that are needed to prevent anemia, and fiber, non-digestible carbohydrates essential in a healthy diet. In conclusion, the daily consumption of 5 or 6 grasshoppers is a good source of nutrients that will provide optimal health to population.	6.2
Multi-server authentication enables the subscribers to enjoy an assortment of services from various service providers based on a single registration from any registration centre. Previously, a subscriber had to register from each service provider individually to avail respective services relying on single server authentication. In the past, a number of multi-server authentication techniques can be witnessed that employed lightweight and even computationally intensive cryptographic operations. In line with this, Zhu has presented a chaotic map based multi-server authentication scheme recently, which is not only vulnerable to denial-of-service attack, stolen-verifier attack, but also lacks anonymity. This research aims at improving the Zhu's protocol in terms of cost and efficiency. Moreover, the comparative study is presented for the performance of improved model against the existing scheme, and the security of proposed model is formally proved using BAN Logic.	0.3
Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the important elements for providing the security in networks. Increasing the number of network-based applications on the one hand and increasing the data volumes on the other hand forced the designers to conduct some research on the novel methods for improving network security. One of the recent efforts to improve IDS performance is developing the machine learning algorithms. Random forest is one of the powerful algorithms employed in data mining. It operates based on classifier fusion principles and is implemented as detection engine in some anomaly-based IDSs. In this paper, we present a novel parallel random forest algorithm for intrusion detection systems. The original random forest algorithm has some weaknesses in feature selection, selecting efficient numbers of classifiers, number of random features for training and also in combination steps. In this research we investigate aforementioned challenges and propose solutions for them. The simulation results show the superiority of our method regarding performance, scalability and cost of misclassified samples in our method in comparison with the original random forest algorithm and Hadoop-based version of the random forest.	0.2
BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling at the CRF1 receptor (CRF1R) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can modulate ethanol consumption in rodents. However, the effects of binge-like ethanol drinking on this system have not been thoroughly characterized, and little is known about the role of CRF2R or the CRF neurocircuitry involved. METHODS: The effects of binge-like ethanol consumption on the VTA CRF system were assessed following drinking-in-the-dark procedures. Intra-VTA infusions of selective CRF1R and/or CRF2R compounds were employed to assess the contributions of these receptors in modulating binge-like ethanol consumption (n = 89). To determine the potential role of CRF projections from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) to the VTA, CRF neurons in this circuit were chemogenetically inhibited (n = 32). Binge-induced changes in VTA CRF system protein and messenger RNA were also assessed (n = 58). RESULTS: Intra-VTA antagonism of CRF1R and activation of CRF2R resulted in decreased ethanol intake, which was eliminated by simultaneous blockade of both receptors. Chemogenetic inhibition of local CRF neurons in the VTA did not alter binge-like ethanol drinking, but inhibition of VTA-projecting CRF neurons from the BNST significantly reduced intake. CONCLUSIONS: We provide novel evidence that 1) blunted binge-like ethanol consumption stemming from CRF1R blockade requires intact CRF2R signaling, and CRF2R activation reduces binge-like drinking; 2) inhibiting VTA-projecting BNST CRF neurons attenuates binge-like drinking; and 3) binge-like ethanol drinking alters protein and messenger RNA associated with the VTA-CRF system. These data suggest that ethanol-induced activation of BNST-to-VTA CRF projections is critical in driving binge-like ethanol intake.	5.4
Environmental pollution caused by inert anthropogenic stressors such as microplastics in aquatic media is constantly increasing. Through the proliferating use of plastic products in daily life, more and more plastic particles enter waters as primary microplastics. Even though large scale plastic items such as plastic bottles and bags represent the highest percentage of plastic waste, their degeneration also generates microparticles and nanoparticles (secondary microplastics). Modern sewage treatment plants require innovative ideas in order to deal with this man-made problem. State-of-the-art technology offers approaches to minimise the amount of microplastics in aquatic systems. These technologies, however, are either insufficient or very costly, as well as time-consuming in both cases. The conceptual idea presented here is to apply innovative inorganic-organic hybrid silica gels which provide a cost-effective and straightforward approach. Currently, the synthesis of preorganised bioinspired compounds is advancing in order to produce functionalised hybrid silica gels in a further step. These gels have the ability to remove stressors such as microplastics from waste water. By means of the sol-gel process, bioinspired silane compounds are currently being permuted to macromolecules and examined with respect to their properties as fixation and filter material in order to remove the hydrophobic anthropogenic stressors sustainably. Here, the reproduction of biological systems plays a significant role. In particular in material sciences, this approach is becoming increasingly important. Among other concepts, new biomimetic molecules form the basis for the investigation of innovative host-guest relationships for anthropogenic stressors in the environment and their implementation in technical processes.	4.4
Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Manually scanning with Ultrasound (US) probe brings heavy work load for the sonographers. This paper proposes a novel Mirror robotic US scanning system. The system is composed of two-arm robot, linear US probes for master and slave side, Kinect sensor as a vision servo. On the master side, sonographers hold one robot arm and operate probe to inspect one leg. On the slave side, the robot follows the master probe on the navigation of Kinect and scans the other leg. 3D images of legs are segmented and register to get mirror matrix. Both Clustered Viewpoint Feature Histogram (CVFH) descriptors of segmented probe and CAD (Computer-Aided Design) training data were calculated to probe recognition. The leg phantom platform was built up. The mirror matrixes were obtained. The correlation coefficients between the two legs are calculated. Times of ICP (Iterative Closest Point) have been calculated for the platform. Results from the initial experiment indicate the idea is feasible and promising greatly by improving the inspection efficiently. Clinically, the method can be implemented for pre-operative procedures to predict the risk of DVT, and this may improve the US scanning efficacy.	3.0
The Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children (PSWQ-C) is one of the most frequently used instruments to assess worry in children. The current study examines the measurement invariance of the PSWQ-C in a Romanian sample. Participants (n = 759) were recruited from both community and clinical populations. Our findings have replicated the good psychometric properties of the PSWQ-C and of the short PSWQ-C (the original scale with the negative items deleted). Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis has supported measurement invariance (configural, metric, scalar) across gender, age and clinical diagnosis. Convergent validity with other assessment measures has also been established. Finally, the implications of the use of the PSWQ-C in the assessment of anxiety in children and adolescents are discussed.	5.4
The strongest and best-documented risk factor for drug hypersensitivity (DH) is the history of a previous reaction. Accidental exposures to drugs may lead to severe or even fatal reactions in sensitized patients. Preventable prescription errors are common. They are often due to inadequate medical history or poor risk assessment of recurrence of drug reaction. Proper documentation is essential information for the doctor to make sound therapeutic decision. The European Network on Drug Allergy and Drug Allergy Interest Group of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology have formed a task force and developed a drug allergy passport as well as general guidelines of drug allergy documentation. A drug allergy passport, a drug allergy alert card, a certificate, and a discharge letter after medical evaluation are adequate means to document DH in a patient. They are to be handed to the patient who is advised to carry the documentation at all times especially when away from home. A drug allergy passport should at least contain information on the culprit drug(s) including international nonproprietary name, clinical manifestations including severity, diagnostic measures, potential cross-reactivity, alternative drugs to prescribe, and where more detailed information can be obtained from the issuer. It should be given to patients only after full allergy workup. In the future, electronic prescription systems with alert functions will become more common and should include the same information as in paper-based documentation.	6.3
BACKGROUND Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle that can follow various viral infections. Why children only rarely develop life-threatening acute viral myocarditis (AVM), given that the causal viral infections are common, is unknown. Genetic lesions might underlie such susceptibilities. Mouse genetic studies demonstrated that interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta immunity defects increased susceptibility to virus-induced myocarditis. Moreover, variations in human TLR3, a potent inducer of IFNs, were proposed to underlie AVM. OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the hypothesis that human genetic factors may underlie AVM in previously healthy children. METHODS We tested the role of TLR3-IFN immunity using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. We then performed whole-exome sequencing of 42 unrelated children with acute myocarditis (AM), some with proven viral causes. RESULTS We found that TLR3-and STAT1-deficient cardiomyocytes were not more susceptible to Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) infection than control cells. Moreover, CVB3 did not induce IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-alpha/beta-stimulated genes in control cardiomyocytes. Finally, exogenous IFN-alpha did not substantially protect cardiomyocytes against CVB3. We did not observe a significant enrichment of rare variations in TLR3-or IFN-alpha/beta-related genes. Surprisingly, we found that homozygous but not heterozygous rare variants in genes associated with inherited cardiomyopathies were significantly enriched in AM-AVM patients compared with healthy individuals (p = 2.22E-03) or patients with other diseases (p = 1.08E-04). Seven of 42 patients (16.7%) carried rare biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) nonsynonymous or splice-site variations in 6 cardiomyopathy-associated genes (BAG3, DSP, PKP2, RYR2, SCN5A, or TNNI3). CONCLUSIONS Previously silent recessive defects of the myocardium may predispose to acute heart failure presenting as AM, notably after common viral infections in children.

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is an ambitious project aimed to build a radio telescope that will enable breakthrough science not possible with current facilities over the next 50 years. Because of this long expected operational period, the maintenance of Telescope Manager (TM), the SKA Element responsible for the coordination of all Elements composing the Telescope (e.g. Dishes for mid-frequency or Low-Frequency Aperture Arrays), plays a crucial role for the overall SKA operation. A challenge is represented by the technological evolution in hardware and software, which is rather fast nowadays: only in the last 10 years, for instance, new operating systems were born, as well as new technologies for data storage and for calculation. Dealing with such changing environment deserves therefore a deep analysis in terms of maintenance. In spite of the importance of hardware maintenance for TM, its software maintenance is actually the real challenge, given TM is a system almost entirely composed by software applications. In computer science, indeed, it is almost impossible to build a software which does not need to be changed over time: new requirements emerge, old requirements change during application lifetime, errors are discovered or performance must be improved. For all these reasons the management of software changes is critical to maintain the value of the software developed, especially for a complex system like SKA TM. In this paper the maintenance for both SKA TM hardware and software is presented with respect to the Operational (i.e. related to Maintenance Process) and Organizational (i.e. related to Logistic Support) aspects.	0.4
Assembly or disassembly sequence planning is a very hard combinatory problem while the assembly parts numbers become important. To reduce this difficulty, especially for the case of complex products, the subassembly identification concept can constitute an original way. It aims to decompose the complex assembly product into some subassembly entities containing a small number of parts. Consequently, the generation of assembly or disassembly sequence planning of parts becomes between the subassemblies and, in that case, can be determined relatively easily. Despite the prettiness of the subassembly method, the identification of subassembly from a computer-aided design (CAD) model remains a relevant research subject to be improved. In this paper, a subassembly identification approach is presented. The proposed approach begins with the exploration of the CAD assembly data to carry out an adjacency matrix. Then, to identify the subassemblies, the extracted matrix is transformed through three steps. The first step consists of idealizing this matrix by removing all connection parts identified by the Feature-Manager, which permits reducing its size. Afterward, based on the reduced matrix, an all-direction matrix is constructed to identify the base part of a subassembly. The third step consists of enriching the all-direction matrix by mounting conditions to construct the set of subassemblies. An example of a CAD assembly mechanism is presented in all sections of this paper in order to explain and discuss the steps of the proposed approach.	3.0
Past research showed that people accumulate more knowledge about other people and objects they like compared to those they dislike. More knowledge is commonly assumed to lead to more differentiated mental representations; therefore, people should perceive others they like as less similar to one another than others they dislike. We predict the opposite outcome based on the density hypothesis (Unkelbach, Fiedler, Bayer, Stegmtiller, & Danner, 2008); accordingly, positive impressions are less diverse than negative impressions as there are only a few ways to be liked but many ways to be disliked. Therefore, people should perceive liked others as more similar to one another than disliked others even though they have more knowledge about liked others. Seven experiments confirm this counterintuitive prediction and show a strong association between liking and perceived similarity in person perception. We discuss the implications of these results for different aspects of person perception. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.2
The current research examined how people form context-based trait impressions and why some of these impressions are stronger than others. This research drew from principles of attention theory (Kruschke, 1996, 2001) in order to account for the processes underlying impression formation in context According to attention theory, the traits expressed by an individual target person in a rarely occurring context should be more strongly associated with that context than the traits expressed in a commonly occurring context are associated with the common context That is, people form stronger impressions of others' behavior in rare compared to common contexts. Four experiments provide support for these predictions. The current study is one of the first to examine the cognitive mechanisms by which perceivers form trait impressions of individuals across different contexts and to explain why some of these impressions are stronger than others. Implications of the nature of these impression formation processes are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.	2.2
The present study was conducted during Protective Edge, a long-lasting military operation between the State of Israel and Hamas in Gaza, during which hundreds of rockets were fired from Gaza into various regions across the country. At the same time, Israeli forces bombed Gaza and sent in ground forces. The military operation ended after 50 days of fighting, with a cease-fire between the warring sides. The aim of this study was to compare attitudes and perceptions of youth from different religious fundamentalist societies, toward the war and their readiness for peace during this specific violent struggle, and attitudes toward the Israeli-Palestinian (I-P) conflict in general. Furthermore, we wanted to examine the links between these attitudes, personal sense of coherence and state anxiety. We compared two groups of adolescents who belong to religious minorities in Israel: ultra-Orthodox and national religious. The sample included a total of 107 subjects from both groups. The young people responded to a questionnaire, distributed during the military operation, while they were still under rocket fire from the Gaza Strip. The questionnaire included: socio-demographic characteristics; attitudes toward the military operation; ways to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; sense of coherence and state anxiety. Results indicate that both groups thought that the I-P conflict would not be resolved peacefully and that there were more wars to come. Furthermore, both national religious and ultra-Orthodox adolescents thought that this operation would have limited success for only a limited time. Regarding the differences between the groups, sense of coherence was higher among the ultra-Orthodox and this group also believed more than their counterparts that everything was in God's hands. Interesting results emerged with peaceful resolution being linked to more anxiety among the national religious group, while among the ultra-Orthodox group no relationships were indicated on these two variables. The results of the study underscore the implications of ongoing political conflicts, alongside the growing global power of religion, which minimizes opportunities for world peace.	5.4
Energy saving is a hot topic due to the proliferation of climate changes and energy challenges globally. However, people's perception about using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality, they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of electricity and its integral role, modulating consumers' attitudes towards energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumers' behaviour and the integration of this understanding into the smart technology. As part of the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its usage to save energy. Areas of current research include: (1) energy consumption in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings, (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of existing solutions.	1.0
Aiming at the problem that the fixed radio frequency identification (RFID) system with lightweight cryptography may be easily illegally controlled, a communication authentication protocol based on quantum key distribution using decoy-state method is proposed and developed in this study. A new RFID-system model using quantum key distribution is introduced, which indicates that the quantum keys are distributed to the RFID tags and reader and EPC information server via weakly coherent photons transmitted through optical fiber. This work mainly presents the protocol description with detailed theoretical analyses, including RFID system's initialization, the transmission, reception, and acquisition of the random quantum key, and the authentication process between the EPC information server and the RFID tag and reader. The security analysis of the protocol is finally carried out, which proves that the proposed protocol can prevent various eavesdropper's attacks with solid security.	0.3
Understanding the sources of chemical components in roof runoff can help to prevent water quality problems in rooftop rainwater harvesting. To identify the contribution of wet deposition to the mass of components in roof runoff, the samples from air, rainwater, dust buildup and roof runoff were collected from an urban site in Shenzhen of China in 2011-2012. The results indicate that: (1) wet deposition has a dominant contribution to the mass of total organic carbon (TOC), NH4+, NO3-, CI- and organic acids in the roof runoff, while the mass of NH4+, acetic acid and formic acid in the roof runoff may be greatly reduced by the neutralization between the components with alkaline dust buildup on the rooftop; and (2) wet deposition partially contributes to the mass of Na+, K+, Mg-2, Ca2+, F- and SO in the roof runoff, while other factors like dust buildup on the rooftop and chemical reactions also have a non-negligible impact. Furthermore, TOC, NH4+, NO3- and organic acids in the wet deposition are mainly influenced by the atmospheric pollution due to fast increase in fossil fuel consumption (e.g. vehicle emissions). Therefore, the effects of wet deposition should be carefully considered for rooftop rainwater harvesting in urbanized areas.	4.3

The possibility of using a sigma-point Kalman filter for estimating the movement of spatial landmarks, a key feature of images characterized by stable detection and recognition within the video stream, is considered. A general model of the camera motion and a method for evaluating its spatial position using a particle filter are presented.	0.0
Bacterial community analyses of samples from a pilot plant for the treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) from the lignite-mining district in Lusatia (East Germany) had previously demonstrated the dominance of two groups of acidophilic iron oxidizers: the novel candidate genus Ferrovum and a group comprising Gallionella-like strains. Since pure culture had proven difficult, previous studies have used genome analyses of co-cultures consisting of Ferrovum and a strain of the heterotrophic acidophile Acidiphilium in order to obtain insight into the life style of these novel bacteria. Here we report on attempts to undertake a similar study on Gallionella-like acidophiles from AMD. Isolates belonging to the family Gallionellaceae are still restricted to the microaerophilic and neutrophilic iron oxidizers Sideroxydans and Gallionella. Availability of genomic or metagenomic sequence data of acidophilic strains of these genera should, therefore, be relevant for defining adaptive strategies in pH homeostasis. This is particularly the case since complete genome sequences of the neutrophilic strains G. capsiferriformans ES-2 and S. lithotrophicus ES-1 permit the direct comparison of the metabolic capacity of neutrophilic and acidophilic members of the same genus and, thus, the detection of biochemical features that are specific to acidophilic strains to support life under acidic conditions. Isolation attempts undertaken in this study resulted in the microaerophilic enrichment culture ADE-12-1 which, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, consisted of at least three to four distinct Gallionellaceae strains that appear to be closely related to the neutrophilic iron oxidizer S. lithotrophicus ES-1. Key hypotheses inferred from the metabolic reconstruction of the metagenomic sequence data of these acidophilic Sideroxydans strains include the putative role of urea hydrolysis, formate oxidation and cyanophycin decarboxylation in pH homeostasis.	6.0
Objective: Questionnaires are often used to assess the results of nasal septoplasty, but response rates vary widely. The possible bias caused by non-responders was evaluated to determine the validity of questionnaire results. Methods: Post-operative questionnaires employing visual analogue scales for nasal obstruction were mailed to 182 patients. The 62 non-responders (34.1 per cent) were contacted by telephone, 58 (93.5 per cent) of whom were contactable and responded orally to the questionnaire. Results: Non-responders were younger, but no different from responders with regard to gender, smoking habits or allergies. Post-operative visual analogue scale obstruction scores were slightly, but not statistically, higher in non-responders. However, because non-responders' pre-operative scores were lower, obstruction scores improved less than in responders. The main reason for not responding was forgetfulness. Some would have preferred an electronic version of the questionnaire. Conclusion: Although post-operative obstruction scores did not differ between the groups, nasal obstruction scores improved more among responders than non-responders. Thus, low response rates may cause bias.	5.1
IP identification (IPID) is an IP header field which is designed to identify a packet in a communication session. The main purpose of IPID is to recover from IP fragmentation. To the best of our knowledge, most existing IPID based information hiding methods assume that the IPID number is a pseudo random number, which is found to be false. In this paper, we propose a steganographic method by exploiting the IPID field while considering the information from the user data field. First, we analyze the IPID distribution of various operating systems. Subsequently, we put forward a simple data embedding method, which is then refined to mimic the ordinary IPID traffic. Experiments are carried out and the results empirically prove that the proposed method is of high undetectability as compared to the existing IPID based steganographic methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper explores the effects of emotions embedded in a seller review on its perceived helpfulness to readers. Drawing on frameworks in literature on emotion and cognitive processing, we propose that over and above a well-known negativity bias, the impact of discrete emotions in a review will vary, and that one source of this variance is reader perceptions of reviewers' cognitive effort. We focus on the roles of two distinct, negative emotions common to seller reviews: anxiety and anger. In the first two studies, experimental methods were utilized to identify and explain the differential impact of anxiety and anger in terms of perceived reviewer effort. In the third study, seller reviews from Yahoo! Shopping web sites were collected to examine the relationship between emotional review content and helpfulness ratings. Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining discrete emotions in online word-of-mouth, and they carry important practical implications for consumers and online retailers.	2.2

An integrated design platform for the newer type of machines is presented in this work. The machine parameters are evaluated out using developed modelling tool. With the machine parameters, the machine is modelled using computer aided tool. The designed machine is brought to simulation tool to perform electromagnetic and electromechanical analysis. In the simulation, conditions setting are performed to setup the materials, meshes, rotational speed and the excitation circuit. Electromagnetic analysis is carried out to predict the behavior of the machine based on the movement of flux in the machines. Besides, electromechanical analysis is carried out to analyse the speed-torque characteristic, the current-torque characteristic and the phase angle-torque characteristic. After all the results are analysed, the designed machine is used to generate S block function that is compatible with MATLAB/SIMULINK tool for the dynamic operational characteristics. This allows the integration of existing drive system into the new machines designed in the modelling tool. An example of the machine design is presented to validate the usage of such a tool.	3.3
Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system incorrectly recognizes self-molecules as foreign; in the case of multiple sclerosis (MS), myelin is attacked. Intriguingly, new studies reveal toll-like receptors (TLRs), pathways usually involved in generating immune responses against pathogens, play a significant role in driving autoimmune disease in both humans and animal models. We reasoned polyplexes formed from myelin self-antigen and regulatory TLR antagonists might limit TLR signaling during differentiation of myelin-specific T cells, inducing tolerance by biasing T cells away from inflammatory phenotypes. Complexes were formed by modifying myelin peptide with cationic amino acids to create peptides able to condense the anionic nucleic-acid based TLR antagonist. These immunological polyplexes eliminate synthetic polymers commonly used to condense polyplexes and do not rely on gene expression; however, the complexes mimic key features of traditional polyplexes such as tunable loading and co-delivery. Using these materials and classic polyplex analysis techniques, we demonstrate condensation of both immune signals, protection from enzymatic degradation, and tunable physicochemical properties. We show polyplexes reduce TLR signaling, and in primary dendritic cell and T cell co-culture, reduce myelin-driven inflammation. During mouse models of MS, these tolerogenic polyplexes improve the progression, severity, and incidence of disease. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	6.3
The selection of suitable working fluids for use in Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) is strongly addicted to the intended application of the ORC system. The design of the ORC, the kind of heat source and the ambient condition has an influence on the performance of the Organic Rankine Cycle and on the selection of the working fluid. It can come to a discrepancy between the best candidate from the thermodynamic point of view and the transformation into a real machine design. If an axial turbine design is considered for expansion and energy conversion within the ORC, the vapor volume flow ratios within the expansion path, the pressure ratio and of course the number of stages have to be considered within the fluid selection process and for the design parameters. Furthermore, environmental aspects have to be taken into account, e.g. the global warming potential (GWP) and the flammability of the selected fluid. This paper shows the results of the design and fluid selection process for an Organic Rankine Cycle for application in a combined operation with a 2MW class industrial gas turbine. The gas turbine contains two radial compressor stages with an integrated intercooler. To further increase the thermal cycle efficiency, a recuperator has been implemented to the gas turbine cycle, which uses the exhaust gas waste heat to preheat the compressed air after the second compressor, before it enters the combustion chamber. The shaft power is generated by a three stage axial turbine, whereby the first stage is a convection cooled stage, due to a turbine inlet temperature of 1100 degrees C. To further increase the electrical efficiency and the power output of the energy conversion cycle, a combined operation with an organic Rankine cycle is intended. Therefore the waste heat from the GT compressor intercooler is used as first heat source and the waste heat of the exhaust gas after the recuperator as second heat source for the Organic Rankine Cycle. It is intended that the ORC fluid acts as heat absorption fluid within the compressor intercooler. Due to these specifications for the ORC, a detailed thermodynamic analysis has been performed to determine the optimal design parameter and the best working fluid for the ORC, in order to obtain a maximum power output of the combined cycle. Due to the twice coupling of the ORC to the GT cycle, the heat exchange between the two cycles is bounded by each other and a detailed analysis of the coupled cycles is necessary. E.g. the ambient temperature has an enormous influence on the transferred heat from the intercooler to the ORC cycle, which itself affects the heat transfer and temperatures of the transferable heat from the second heat source. Thus, a detailed analysis by considering the ambient operation conditions has been performed, in order to provide a most efficient energy conversion system over a wide operation range. The performance analysis has shown that by application of an ORC for a combined operation with the intercooled and recuperated gas turbine, the combined cycle efficiency can be increased, for a wide ambient conditions range, by more than 3 %pts. and the electrical power output by more than 10 %, in comparison to the stand alone intercooled and recuperated gas turbine.	3.3
Purpose The activity of the glymphatic system is impaired in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We evaluated the activity of the human glymphatic system in cases of AD with a diffusion-based technique called diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS). Materials and methods Diffusion tensor images were acquired to calculate diffusivities in the x, y, and z axes of the plane of the lateral ventricle body in 31 patients. We evaluated the diffusivity along the perivascular spaces as well as projection fibers and association fibers separately, to acquire an index for diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS-index) and correlated them with the mini mental state examinations (MMSE) score. Results We found a significant negative correlation between diffusivity along the projection fibers and association fibers. We also observed a significant positive correlation between diffusivity along perivascular spaces shown as ALPS-index and the MMSE score, indicating lower water diffusivity along the perivascular space in relation to AD severity. Conclusion Activity of the glymphatic system may be evaluated with diffusion images. Lower diffusivity along the perivascular space on DTI-APLS seems to reflect impairment of the glymphatic system. This method may be useful for evaluating the activity of the glymphatic system.	5.2
Background: Densoviruses (DVs) are highly pathogenic to their hosts. However, we previously reported a mutualistic DV (HaDV2). Very little was known about the characteristics of this virus, so herein we undertook a series of experiments to explore the molecular biology of HaDV2 further. Results: Phylogenetic analysis showed that HaDV2 was similar to members of the genus Iteradensovirus. However, compared to current members of the genus Iteradensovirus, the sequence identity of HaDV2 is less than 44% at the nucleotide-level, and lower than 36, 28 and 19% at the amino-acid-level of VP, NS1 and NS2 proteins, respectively. Moreover, NS1 and NS2 proteins from HaDV2 were smaller than those from other iteradensoviruses due to their shorter N-terminal sequences. Two transcripts of about 2.2 kb coding for the NS proteins and the VP proteins were identified by Northern Blot and RACE analysis. Using specific anti-NS1 and anti-NS2 antibodies, Western Blot analysis revealed a 78 kDa and a 48 kDa protein, respectively. Finally, the localization of both NS1 and NS2 proteins within the cell nucleus was determined by using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) labelling. Conclusion: The genome organization, terminal hairpin structure, transcription and expression strategies as well as the mutualistic relationship with its host, suggested that HaDV2 was a novel member of the genus Iteradensovirus within the subfamily Densovirinae.	6.0
Purpose - Nonverbal communication comprises a core element of the interactions between leader and follower. Nevertheless, there is limited empirical attention regarding the impact of nonverbal cues on followers' attitudinal outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this gap by linking a salient form of nonverbal communication, kinesics, to an under-researched leader-follower relationship outcome, that is relational identification (RI) with the supervisor. In doing so, the authors also highlight the mediating role of leader-member exchange (LMX) in the aforementioned relationship. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two studies in different countries. Moreover, the authors examined the hypotheses using hierarchical regression and bootstrap analysis. Findings - As hypothesized, the present results showed that kinesics have both a direct and an indirect effect, through LMX, on RI with the supervisor. Originality/value - To the best of authors' knowledge this is the first study that links a form of nonverbal communication to both LMX and RI.	2.3
Double-layer cladding materials were fabricated by roll bonding using stainless steel (STS439) and aluminum (Al1050) sheets to investigate the thermal conduction of multi-layer composites. The measured thermal conductivities were compared to values calculated from cross-plane models that are widely used for resistor connections in electrical circuits. The measured thermal conductivity was 88.3 W/m.K for the sample containing 76 vol% of Al1050. Unexpectedly, the measured cross-plane thermal conductivities were always higher than the values calculated from the series model. The high cross-plane thermal conductivities were attributed to the contribution of phonons to thermal transfer. A deviation index of the thermal conductivity, F-m(s), is proposed, which effectively describes the cross plane thermal conductivity characteristics of double-layer materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Biofilm acts stabilising river-bed sediments, interfering with particle entrainment and, consequently, preventing bed disturbance. In this paper we present the results of a series of experiments carried out in indoor channels, aimed to understand biofilm alteration of bed material motion and topographic changes in stream channels. We analysed the erosion patterns and bedload rates in non-cohesive sediments in channels colonised by biofilms and compared them to biofilm-free others. All the channels had the same conditions of light irradiance, temperature, slope, and particle size (sand). Discharge and water surface slope were modified to create a range of hydraulic conditions, with pairs of colonised and non-colonised channels subjected to the same flows. We observed that biofilm slightly modified bed roughness and flow hydraulics, but that highly influenced bed disturbance. Biofilm caused bed scour to occur in patches unevenly distributed along the channel length, as a result of localised weaknesses of the biofilm. Once biofilm was ripped up it was transported in chunks, and sand grains were observed attached to these chunks. In non-colonised sediments the erosion was more homogeneous and the formation and movement of bedforms were observed. On average, bedload rates were 5 times lower when biofilm was present. Overall, the protective effect of the biofilm prevented generalised erosion of the channel and delayed the entrainment and transport of sand grains. Results emphasised the important role of biofilm in the incipient motion of bed-material in stream channels; this role may affect the magnitude and frequency of subsequent river bed processes, notably the onset of bedload and associated channel morpho-dynamics.

Rainwater is an underutilized water resource that has become more important in recent years; due to severe water logging and water shortage in cities. The evaluation of rainwater harvesting potential is of fundamental importance in planning rainwater harvesting systems and management policies. In this study, we used minute-interval rainfall data and the water mass balance method coupling urban hydrological processes to assess the annual rainwater availability potential (RAP) of different underlying surfaces in the urban areas of Beijing (inside the 5th Ring Road). The estimated total RAP was 154.49 million m(3) in 2013. About 53% of rainwater could be effectively harvested for use, among which the rooftops had the highest harvesting ratio of 70%, and contributed about half of the total RAP. Indirect use of rainwater can be achieved through infiltration facilities, of which concave green land construction and porous brick pavement can increase the amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil by 18.89% and 55.69%, respectively. Rainwater harvesting and utilization could serve as a significant water source for the urban areas in Beijing.	4.3
HMGCS2 (mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2) is a control enzyme in ketogenesis. The mitochondrial localization and interaction with APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) suggest that HMGCS2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD (Alzheimer's disease). Here we report that overexpression of HMGCS2 decreased levels of APP and related CTFs (carboxy-terminal fragments), which was largely prevented by an autophagic inhibitor chloroquine. In addition, HMGCS2 enhancement of autophagic marker LC3II was diminished by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin. Moreover, deprivation of EBSS (Earle's Balanced Salt Solution) significantly augmented the effect of HMGCS2 on LC3II, while acetoacetate reversed the reduction of LC3II, APP and CTFs which was induced by HMGCS2 knockdown. In the presence of acetoacetate, rapamycin failed to induce further increase of LC3IL which mimicked the effect of HMGCS2 overexpression. Finally, HMGCS2 enhanced the antioxidant response. Collectively, HMGCS2 shares with ketone bodies common features in autophagic clearance of APP and CTFs, suggesting that ketone bodies play an important role in HMGCS2 regulation of the autophagy.

Background: Differences in genetics and receptor expression (phenotypes) of invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC) impact on prognosis and treatment response. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), the most used technique for IDC phenotyping, has some limitations including its invasiveness. We explored the possibility of contrast-enhanced positron emission tomography magnetic resonance (CE-FDG PET/MR) to discriminate IDC phenotypes. Methods: 21 IDC patients with IHC assessment of oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2), and antigen Ki-67 (Ki67) underwent CE-FDG PET/MR. Magnetic resonance-perfusion biomarkers, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and standard uptake value (SUV) were compared with IHC markers and phenotypes, using a Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: ER/PR - tumours demonstrated higher Kep(mean) and SUVmax than ER or PR+ tumours. HER2 - tumours displayed higher ADC(mean), Kep(mean), and SUVmax than HER2+tumours. Only ADC(mean) discriminated Ki6714% tumours. PET/MR biomarkers correlated with IHC phenotype in 13 out of 21 patients (62%; P = 0.001). Conclusions: Positron emission tomography magnetic resonance might non-invasively help discriminate IDC phenotypes, helping to optimise individual therapy options.	6.4
Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies are successfully used in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the molecular mechanism of action of these agents is still a matter of debate. Apart from neutralization of TNF, influence on the intestinal barrier function, induction of apoptosis in mucosal immune cells, formation of regulatory macrophages as well as other immune modulating properties have been discussed as central features. Nevertheless, clinically effective anti-TNF antibodies were shown to differ in their mode-of-action in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the anti-TNF agent etanercept is effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but failed to induce clinical response in Crohn's disease patients, suggesting different contributions of TNF in the pathogenesis of these inflammatory diseases. In the following, we will review different aspects regarding the mechanism of action of anti-TNF agents in general and analyze comparatively different effects of each anti-TNF agent such as TNF neutralization, modulation of the immune system, reverse signaling and induction of apoptosis. We discuss the relevance of the membrane-bound form of TNF compared to the soluble form for the immunopathogenesis of IBD. Furthermore, we review reports that could lead to personalized medicine approaches regarding treatment with anti-TNF antibodies in chronic intestinal inflammation, by predicting response to therapy.

In this paper, we analyze the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the ice-sheet data collected over Jakobshavn Glacier with the airborne Multichannel Radar Depth Sounder (MCRDS) during the 2006 field season. We extracted weak ice-bed echoes buried in signals scattered by the rough surface of the fast-flowing Jakobshavn Glacier by analyzing the DOA of signals received with a five-element receive-antenna array. This allowed us to obtain ice thickness information, which is a key parameter when generating bed topography of glaciers. We also estimated ice-bed roughness and bed slope from the combined analysis of the DOA and radar waveforms. The bed slope is about 8 degrees and the roughness in terms of rms slope is about 16 degrees.	4.2
Accurately scaling sap flux observations to tree or stand levels requires accounting for variation in sap flux between wood types and by depth into the tree. However, existing models for radial variation in axial sap flux are rarely used because they are difficult to implement. there is uncertainty about their predictive ability and calibration measurements are often unavailable. Here we compare different models with a diverse sap flux data set to test the hypotheses that radial profiles differ by wood type and tree size. We show that radial variation in sap flux is dependent on wood type but independent of tree size for a range of temperate trees. The best-fitting model predicted out-of-sample sap flux observations and independent estimates of sapwood area with small errors, suggesting robustness in the new settings. We develop a method for predicting whole-tree water use with this model and include computer code for simple implementation in other studies.	3.1
Recent work has shown robust associations between morality and cleanliness. However, it is not known whether this association is equally consequential for everyone. I predicted that individuals high (vs. low) in God-belief would be more likely to draw upon feelings of cleanliness to represent their moral concerns. To test this hypothesis, I used a 2-week daily sampling protocol. In an initial session, I measured participants' (N = 135) level of God-belief. I then measured participants' levels of daily cleanliness, neuroticism, impulsivity, and prosocial behaviors every evening. Daily feelings of cleanliness predicted lower levels of neuroticism but only for those high in God-belief. Daily impulsive behaviors predicted lower feelings of cleanliness, and daily prosocial behaviors predicted higher feelings of cleanliness. God-belief moderated these effects such that they were stronger for those higher, than lower, in God-belief. In closing, I discuss potential reasons for these moderation effects and other theoretical considerations.	2.4
Perceived Vulnerability to Disease may be defined as the beliefs about personal susceptibility to the transmission of infectious diseases and the emotional discomfort associated with the potential disease transmission. To evaluate these beliefs, the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVD) has been used in most studies. The aim of Study 1 was to validate the PVD questionnaire to the Spanish population. The sample was made up of 744 university students from all over Spain. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the items on the short version of the questionnaire corresponding to an interrelated two-factor model (perceived infectability and germ aversion) showed the best fit of all the tested models. In Study 2, scales to measure antifat attitudes, disgust and negative attitudes towards AIDS were used to analyse the criterion validity of the PVD questionnaire. The sample was made up of 434 university students. It was found that germ aversion was positively related with antifat attitudes, disgust and negative attitudes towards AIDS. In light of these results, we conclude that the short version of the questionnaire has good psychometric properties and can be used by the scientific community to measure Perceived Vulnerability to Disease.	2.0
To design electric machines, the motor performance, cost, and manufacturing have to be considered. Hence, researchers have called this the multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem in which the goal is to minimize or maximize several objective functions at the same time. In order to solve the MOO problem, various algorithms, such as nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, have been widely used. When these algorithms are applied to the electric machine design, much time consumption is inevitable due to many times of function evaluations using a finite-element method. To solve this problem, a novel surrogate-assisted MOO algorithm is proposed. Its validity is confirmed by comparing the optimization results of test functions with conventional optimization methods. To verify the feasibility of its application to a practical electric machine, an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor is designed.	3.3
This paper presents the results of centrifuge tests performed to investigate the behavior of geotextile-reinforced soil walls beyond stress conditions. The models were built using nonwoven fabrics as reinforcement layers and dry sand as backfill. Digital image analysis techniques were used to determine the displacement of sand markers placed along the reinforcements. The models were loaded until failure by increasing centrifugal acceleration, and the movements of the sand markers were used to determine the strain distributions along the reinforcement layers. The results revealed that stresses redistribute among reinforcement layers as models approach failure. Current design methods for GRS walls were found to be conservative when applied to predict the behavior of the reduced-scale models.	4.1
Smiling individuals are usually perceived more favorably than non-smiling ones-they are judged as happier, more attractive, competent, and friendly. These seemingly clear and obvious consequences of smiling are assumed to be culturally universal, however most of the psychological research is carried out in WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) and the influence of culture on social perception of nonverbal behavior is still understudied. Here we show that a smiling individual may be judged as less intelligent than the same non-smiling individual in cultures low on the GLOBE's uncertainty avoidance dimension. Furthermore, we show that corruption at the societal level may undermine the prosocial perception of smiling-in societies with high corruption indicators, trust toward smiling individuals is reduced. This research fosters understanding of the cultural framework surrounding nonverbal communication processes and reveals that in some cultures smiling may lead to negative attributions.	2.2
Detecting sentiment of sentences in online reviews is still a challenging task. Traditional machine learning methods often use bag-of-words representations which cannot properly capture complex linguistic phenomena in sentiment analysis. Recently, recursive autoencoder (RAE) methods have been proposed for sentence-level sentiment analysis. They use word embedding to represent each word, and learn compositional vector representation of phrases and sentences with recursive autoencoders. Although RAE methods outperform other state-of-the-art sentiment prediction approaches on commonly used datasets, they tend to generate very deep parse trees, and need a large amount of labeled data for each node during the process of learning compositional vector representations. Furthermore, RAE methods mainly combine adjacent words in sequence with a greedy strategy, which make capturing semantic relations between distant words difficult. To solve these issues, we propose a semi-supervised method which combines HowNet lexicon to train phrase recursive autoencoders (we call it CHL-PRAE). CHL-PRAE constructs the phrase recursive autoencoder (PRAE) model at first. Then the model calculates the sentiment orientation of each node with the HowNet lexicon, which acts as sentiment labels, when we train the softmax classifier of PRAE. Furthermore, our CHL-PRAE model conducts bidirectional training to capture global information. Compared with RAE and some supervised methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayesian on English and Chinese datasets, the experiment results show that CHL-PRAE can provide the best performance for sentence-level sentiment analysis.

This paper presents a division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control based modular multilevel converter. Modular multilevel converters (MMC) have been applied to static synchronous compensators (STATCOM), high-voltage direct-current transmission (HVDCT), back-to-back power transfer systems, wind/solar power generation and battery storage systems. The D-Sigma digital control is adopted to track current reference, balance dc-bus capacitor voltage and regulate cell module capacitor voltage. The adopted D-Sigma digital control can accommodate wide filter inductance variation and take care of source voltage harmonics to achieve fast tracking response and low-distortion output current for the applications of active and reactive power injection and rectification with power factor correction. Based on power-balance principle, the combination of dc offset current and the ac current of each arm can be determined. According to charge-balance principle and with the D-Sigma digital control, dc-bus capacitor voltage balancing and cell voltage regulation can be achieved. To ensure the output current with low harmonics, a limitation factor for cell voltage regulation is discussed. In the paper, the MMC configuration is introduced first, and then the control laws for current tracking and voltage regulation are derived in detail. Simulated and experimental results obtained from a 54 kW MMC have verified the analysis and discussion.	1.4
The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between crack/cocaine addiction and dental health in men. Forty crack/cocaine-addicted patients and 120 nonaddicted patients (>= 18 years) underwent full-mouth dental examinations. Decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) were identified using the criteria recommended by the World Health Organization. Crack/cocaine addiction was determined, based on the medical records and interviews of each patient. All drug-addicted patients used both crack and cocaine. The chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to assess the association between DMFT and crack/cocaine addiction (p <= 0.05). Decayed teeth showed a positive association with crack/cocaine addiction (odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.68-7.92; p = 0.001), whereas filled and missing teeth showed a negative association ( filled teeth: OR = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18-0.76; p = 0.008; missing teeth: OR = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.81; p = 0.02). The DMFT was only associated with age (OR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11-4.08, p = 0.023). In the present population, crack/cocaine addiction was associated with a greater decayed teeth index and a lower filled and missing teeth index. Programs aimed to encourage self-esteem and encourage individuals to seek dental care are required for this population. Further studies using a larger sample size and studies with women are required to confirm the results.	5.0
The demand for battery fed electrical vehicle (BFEV) is expected to ascend with the rapid depletion of the earth's petroleum resources. But the range of BFEV is still limited due to the limitation in energy conversion efficiency, energy recovery during braking operation and fast transient operation. So, the analysis and improvement of energy conversion system for BFEVs is strongly recommended. This paper presents a highly efficient electrical circuit for BFEVs with the combination of a PI controlled bi-directional DC-DC converter and a Cuk converter. First, the PI controlled isolated DC-DC bi-directional converter is designed to provide desired battery voltage for dc motor control and to run the flow of power under both steady-state and transient conditions. A boost converter is designed by using one IGBT and one MOSFET in parallel to condense the conduction loss and to guarantee a high output voltage. A comparative performance analysis between a Cuk and a boost converter technique for BFEVs is also presented. An equivalent MATLAB/Simulink simulation model of the both system is developed to investigate the performance of both electrical circuits at different operating conditions. The Cuk converter technique exhibits higher efficiency and better performance as compared to the proposed boost converter technique.	1.2
Herbs and spices have been used for food and medicinal purposes for centuries - the first recorded evidence of their use dates back to 1500BC and the Ebers Papyrus, which mentioned spices such as anise, mustard, saffron, cinnamon, and cassia. Now, in the 21st century, a variety of secondary compounds produced by plants are used in many fields of industry, such as food production (to improve taste, to provide vitamins and macro- and microelements, and also to inhibit food spoilage caused by foodborne bacteria), in medicine (in the treatment of various diseases; in chemoprevention and cancer therapy; as a source of natural antimicrobials for the treatment of infectious disease), and in pharmacology and cosmetology (in dietary supplements, and as a result of the demand for preservative-free cosmetics, to reduce the risk of methylparaben allergies). The aim of this review is to present the major active compounds in herbs and spices and explore their potential applications in industry.	5.1
Selecting the relevant factors in a particular domain is of utmost interest in the machine learning community. This paper concerns the feature selection process for twin support vector machine (TWSVM), a powerful classification method that constructs two nonparallel hyperplanes in order to define a classification rule. Besides the Euclidean norm, our proposal includes a second regularizer that aims at eliminating variables in both twin hyperplanes in a synchronized fashion. The baseline classifier is a twin SVM implementation based on second order cone programMing, which confers robustness to the approach and leads to potentially better predictive performance compared to the standard TWSVM formulation. The proposal is studied empirically and compared with well-known feature selection methods using microarray datasets, on which it succeeds at finding low dimensional solutions with highest average performance among all the other methods studied in this work.	0.1
This study aims to investigate the initial perceived knowledge and skills of high school students in information technology (IT) security and the effect of an online security support tool, the Security Portal (SP), on students' perceived knowledge and skills in IT security. The SP is a website designed and developed as an extracurricular learning tool to improve high school students' knowledge and skills in IT security. An exploratory research design with descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was conducted to answer the research questions. The data were collected from the participants through the Perceived Knowledge and Skills in IT Security questionnaire, administered as pre-test and post-test before and after using the SP. The results of the study indicated that the majority of students were not aware about their schools' IT security policies and rules. Similarly, students had limited knowledge of the rules for using IT devices at their homes. Students' perceived knowledge and skills in (i) virus infection, (ii) awareness about IT crimes and unlicensed products, (iii) security settings of operating systems, (iv) Windows firewall and defender, (v) security settings of Android OS except adding owner information (vi) security issues related to e-mails, except risk associated with opening e-mails from unknown senders, (vii) security issues of web browsers and SNSs except security and privacy settings of SNSs, could be improved by using such tools.	0.4
Smart environments are interactive spaces that offer quality of life for users. Considering this definition, our study aims to investigate papers containing projects and/or evaluation of smart environments in the context of smart cities, using gesture-based interaction applied in health solutions. Our approach is a systematic review of the literature that examined the following databases: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Springer, CiteSeerX and Google Scholar, from November 13 to December 18, 2014. From 212 studies identified, only 12 were in agreement with the eligibility criteria. After analysis of the papers, the usability of smart gesture-based environments was discussed considering the medical area, presenting possible benefits for healthcare.	4.0
Fifty years after the end of the Algerian war of independence, French colonization in Algeria (1830-1962) is still a very controversial topic when sporadically brought to the forefront of the public sphere. One way to better understand current intergroup relationships between French of French origin and French with Algerian origins is to investigate how the past influences the present. This study explores French students' emotional reactions to this historical period, their ideological underpinnings and their relationship with the willingness to compensate for past misdeeds, and with prejudice. Results show that French students with French ascendants endorse a no-remorse norm when thinking about past colonization of Algeria and express very low levels of collective guilt and moral-outrage related emotions, especially those students with a right-wing political orientation and a national identification in the form of glorification of the country. These group-based emotions are significantly related to pro-social behavioral intentions (i.e. the willingness to compensate) and to prejudice toward the outgroup.	2.0
Purpose of Review The review focused on associations between temperament dimensions and clinical features in different anxiety disorders, likewise in obsessive-compulsive disorder in clinical samples of adults. A literature search was conducted in the Medline and PsycINFO databases covering the years 2010-2016. A systematic review and grading of the level of evidence for an association between temperament dimension scores and clinical features in each disorder were performed. Recent Findings Twenty papers reporting 18 different studies were included. Five of the papers focused on panic disorder (PD), five on social anxiety disorder (SAD), three on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), one on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), three on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and an additional three papers on several anxiety disorders. Summary The review consolidates the finding that trait anxiety, especially as assessed by Cloninger's model or the fivefactor model, is a phenomenon common to all anxiety disorders and OCD. More follow-up studies including large samples are needed to differentiate the dimensional profiles of trait anxiety in specific disorders.	5.4
At present, most cases of unresectable cancer cannot be cured. Genetic mutations, EMT, and cancer stem cells are three major issues linked to poor prognosis in such cases, all connected by inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Issues on inter-/intra-tumor heterogeneity of genetic mutation could be resolved with recent and future technologies of deep sequencers, whereas, regarding such issues as the same genome, different epigenome/phenotype, we expect to solve many of these problems in the future through further research in stem cell biology. We herein review and discuss the three major issues in the biology of cancers, especially from the standpoint of stem cell biology.	6.1
Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide nanocomposite (VACNT-GO) has been prepared and applied as electrode material. First, dense packets of VACNT were prepared in microwave chemical vapor deposition reactor, and then functionalized by oxygen plasma etching. We observed that oxygen plasma could exfoliate carbon nanotubes tips and provide oxygen group attachment on its surface, changing its wettability as well. This change in wettability of the VACNT is crucial for its electrochemical application, since as-grown VACNT is super-hydrophobic. After exfoliation and functionalization, the electrochemical tests were performed using potassium ferrocyanide. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy revealed fast electron transfer kinetics on this new material. The CV peak potential separation was 59 mV, suggesting ideal reversibility at the electrode. The Nyquist and Bode plots were well-fitted as modified Randles equivalent electrical circuits with non-charge transfer impedance. This new highly porous nanostructures have been intensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, surface wettability, Raman and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Our results suggest this new material has a relevant potential for future applications in electrocatalysis and (bio)sensors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.2
Objectives: Exposure-based cognitive behavioural therapy (eCBT) is an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. Response varies between individuals. Gene expression integrates genetic and environmental influences. We analysed the effect of gene expression and genetic markers separately and together on treatment response.Methods: Adult participants (n181) diagnosed with panic disorder or a specific phobia underwent eCBT as part of standard care. Percentage decrease in the Clinical Global Impression severity rating was assessed across treatment, and between baseline and a 6-month follow-up. Associations with treatment response were assessed using expression data from 3,233 probes, and expression profiles clustered in a data- and literature-driven manner. A total of 3,343,497 genetic variants were used to predict treatment response alone and combined in polygenic risk scores. Genotype and expression data were combined in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses.Results:Expression levels were not associated with either treatment phenotype in any analysis. A total of 1,492 eQTLs were identified with q<0.05, but interactions between genetic variants and treatment response did not affect expression levels significantly. Genetic variants did not significantly predict treatment response alone or in polygenic risk scores.Conclusions: We assessed gene expression alone and alongside genetic variants. No associations with treatment outcome were identified. Future studies require larger sample sizes to discover associations.	6.4
Background: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. Resident macrophages at distant sites provide a highly responsive and immunologically dynamic innate immune response against foreign infiltrates. Despite extensive characterization of the role of macrophages and other immune cells in malignant tissues, there is very little known about the mechanisms which facilitate metastatic breast cancer spread to distant sites of immunological integrity. The mechanisms by which a key healthy defense mechanism fails to protect distant sites from infiltration by metastatic cells in cancer patients remain undefined. Breast tumors, typical of many tumor types, shed membrane vesicles called microparticles (MPs), ranging in size from 0.1-1 mu m in diameter. MPs serve as vectors in the intercellular transfer of functional proteins and nucleic acids and in drug sequestration. In addition, MPs are also emerging to be important players in the evasion of cancer cell immune surveillance. Methods: A comparative analysis of effects of MPs isolated from human breast cancer cells and non-malignant human brain endothelial cells were examined on THP-1 derived macrophages in vitro. MP-mediated effects on cell phenotype and functionality was assessed by cytokine analysis, cell chemotaxis and phagocytosis, immunolabelling, flow cytometry and confocal imaging. Student's t-test or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison and statistical analysis. Results: In this paper we report on the discovery of a new cellular basis for immune evasion, which is mediated by breast cancer derived MPs. MPs shed from multidrug resistant (MDR) cells were shown to selectively polarize macrophage cells to a functionally incapacitated state and facilitate their engulfment by foreign cells. Conclusions: We propose this mechanism may serve to physically disrupt the inherent immune response prior to cancer cell colonization whilst releasing mediators required for the recruitment of distant immune cells. These findings introduce a new paradigm in cancer cell biology with significant implications in understanding breast cancer colonization at distant sites. Most importantly, this is also the first demonstration that MPs serve as conduits in a parallel pathway supporting the cellular survival of MDR cancer cells through immune evasion.	6.1
This paper presents the first method that enables the fully automatic generation of triangular meshes suitable for the so-called non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS)-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM). The meshes generated with the proposed approach account for the computer-aided design boundary representation of the domain given by NURBS curves. The characteristic element size is completely independent of the geometric complexity and of the presence of very small geometric features. The proposed strategy allows to circumvent the time-consuming process of de-featuring complex geometric models before a finite element mesh suitable for the analysis can be produced. A generalisation of the original definition of a NEFEM element is also proposed, enabling to treat more complicated elements with an edge defined by several NURBS curves or more than one edge defined by different NURBS. Three examples of increasing difficulty demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach and illustrate the advantages compared with those of traditional finite element mesh generators. Finally, a simulation of an electromagnetic scattering problem is considered to show the applicability of the generated meshes for finite element analysis. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Endmember extraction is one of the most important issues in hyperspectral image analysis. Under the linear mixing model and pure pixel assumption, a number of convex-geometry-based methods have been developed in the past decades. However, these traditional methods generally produce unsatisfactory results since they require the hyperspectral image to have a convex structure and this is not exactly the case with the real image scene. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has recently been employed to address the endmember extraction problem, but its performance is limited by the premature convergence and lower precision of the standard PSO, and much effort is required to enhance the optimization result. To address these problems, in this study, a novel quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is proposed for hyperspectral endmember extraction. The notable advantages of the proposed method include: 1) a row-column coding approach for the particles is designed to accelerate the optimization process; 2) a cooperative approach is employed to update the particles' individual and global best positions, in order to help the particles' optimization behavior in the multidimensional search space; and 3) two kinds of objective functions, namely, maximizing the simplex volume formed by the endmember combination, and minimizing the root-mean-square error between the original image and its remixed image, are incorporated in a sequential optimization approach for the endmember extraction problem, which makes the algorithm robust to outliers at an acceptable time cost. The extensive experimental results prove that QPSO is able to find the optimal endmember combination.	4.2
In our continued effort in reducing resource consumption, greener technologies such as rainwater harvesting could be very useful in diminishing our dependence on desalinated or treated water and the associated energy requirements. This paper applies exergy analysis and exergetic efficiency to evaluate the performance of eight different scenarios of urban rainwater harvesting systems in the Mediterranean-climate Metropolitan Area of Barcelona where water is a scarce resource. A life cycle approach is taken, where the production, use, and end-of-life stages of these rainwater harvesting systems are quantified in terms of energy and material requirements in order to produce 1 m(3) of rainwater per year for laundry purposes. The results show that the highest exergy input is associated with the energy uses, namely the transport of the materials to construct the rainwater harvesting systems. The scenario with the highest exergetic efficiency considers a 24 household building with a 21 m(3) rainwater storage tank installed below roof. Exergy requirements could be minimized by material substitution, minimizing weight or distance traveled. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.3
Digital images may contain undesired blurred regions. Automatic detection of such regions and estimation of the amount of blurriness in a given image are important issues in many computer vision applications. This paper presents a simple and effective method to automatically detect blurred regions. The proposed method consists of two main parts. First, a novel blur metric, which can significantly distinguish blur and non-blur regions, is proposed. This metric is then used to generate a blur map to encode the amount of blurriness for individual pixels in a given image. Finally, the estimated blur map is used to segment the input image into blurred/non-blurred regions by applying a pixon-based technique. The proposed approach is evaluated for out-of-focus and motion-blurred natural images. By conducting experiments on a large dataset containing real images with defocus blur and partial motion blur regions, qualitative and quantitative measures are performed. The obtained results in this paper show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for blur estimation in digital images.	0.0
Environmental justice (EJ) research seeks to document and redress the disproportionate environmental burdens and benefits associated with social inequalities. Although its initial focus was on disparities in exposure to anthropogenic pollution, the scope of EJ research has expanded. In the context of intensifying social inequalities and environmental problems, there is a need to further strengthen the EJ research framework and diversify its application. This Special Issue of the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH) incorporates 19 articles that broaden EJ research by considering emerging topics such as energy, food, drinking water, flooding, sustainability, and gender dynamics, including issues in Canada, the UK, and Eastern Europe. Additionally, the articles contribute to three research themes: (1) documenting connections between unjust environmental exposures and health impacts by examining unsafe infrastructure, substance use, and children's obesity and academic performance; (2) promoting and achieving EJ by implementing interventions to improve environmental knowledge and health, identifying avenues for sustainable community change, and incorporating EJ metrics in government programs; and (3) clarifying stakeholder perceptions of EJ issues to extend research beyond the documentation of unjust conditions and processes. Collectively, the articles highlight potentially compounding injustices and an array of approaches being employed to achieve EJ.	4.4
The impact on water resources caused by municipal wastewater discharges has become a critical and ever-growing environmental and public health problem. In order to be able to efficiently address this problem, it is important to adopt an integrated approach that includes a decrease in and control of contamination at its source. These principles have been successfully applied in the industrial sector and now these concepts are also being applied to integrated water resources management. In this context the conceptual model of the Three Steps Strategic Approach (3-SSA) was developed, consisting of: 1) minimization and prevention, 2) treatment for reuse and 3) stimulated natural self-purification. This paper is focused on the first step. The assessment includes a case study in the expansion area of the city of Cali, Colombia (410,380 new inhabitants). The evaluation of alternatives is done using two different system boundaries: (1) reduction in water supply costs for households, savings associated with the drinking water infrastructure and the avoided costs in the infrastructure of additional sewerage and wastewater treatment facilities; and (2) only taking into account the reduction in water supply costs for households and the savings associated with the drinking water infrastructure. The alternatives of minimization and prevention were hierarchized using an analytic hierarchy process and grey relational analysis. A cost-benefit analysis was carried out to compare the highest ranked alternatives with the conventional approach, which considers a 'business as usual scenario' of high water use, end-of-pipe wastewater treatment plant and the conventional water supply system with drinking water quality for all uses. The best minimization and prevention alternatives for Cali's expansion zone were found to be those which consider dual flush toilets and the possibility of using rainwater harvesting for laundry purposes. However, the minimization and prevention alternatives considered are only viable if these are implemented in more than 20% of household units. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.3
Few studies have addressed likely gene x gene (ie, epistatic) interactions in mediating risk for schizophrenia. Using a preclinical genetic approach, we investigated whether simultaneous disruption of the risk factors Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) would produce a disease-relevant phenotypic profile different from that observed following disruption to either gene alone. NRG1 heterozygotes exhibited hyperactivity and disruption to prepulse inhibition, both reversed by antipsychotic treatment, and accompanied by reduced striatal dopamine D2 receptor protein expression, impaired social cognition, and altered glutamatergic synaptic protein expression in selected brain areas. Single gene DISC1 mutants demonstrated a disruption in social cognition and nest-building, altered brain 5-hydroxytryptamine levels and hippocampal ErbB4 expression, and decreased cortical expression of the schizophrenia-associated microRNA miR-29b. Co-disruption of DISC1 and NRG1, indicative of epistasis, evoked an impairment in sociability and enhanced self-grooming, accompanied by changes in hypothalamic oxytocin/ vasopressin gene expression. The findings indicate specific behavioral correlates and underlying cellular pathways downstream of main effects of DNA variation in the schizophrenia-associated genes NRG1 and DISC1.	2.1
Biocathode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been shown to be useful in reductively changing Cr(VI) into Cr(III)-related precipitates on the surface of electrochemically active bacteria (EAB), but the occurrence of intracellular Cr(VI) reduction in the EAB are still unclear. Based on the four EAB isolated from Cr(VI)-reduced biocathode MFCs and tentatively assigned to Stenotrophomonas sp. YS1, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia YS2, Serratia marcescens YS3 and Achromobacterxylosoxidans YS8, a naphthalimide-rhodamine based Cr(III) fluorescent probe was used for the first time to sense the intracellular Cr(III) ions, inevitably and transiently formed from Cr(VI) reduction in these EAB. More Cr(VI) was reduced in the MFC biocathodes, resulting in intracellular accumulation of total chromium of 45.1 +/- 1.3-60.5 +/- 1.4% with a composite of Cr(III) ions (23.7 +/- 2.6-27.3 +/- 1.1%) and other forms of chromium-complex (18.7 +/- 2.5-32.2 +/- 0.8%), In the open circuit controls, intracellular total chromium only ranged 10.2 +/- 1.5-11.7 +/- 0.8% (Cr(III) ions: 8.2 +/- 0.6-9.5 +/- 0.9%; other forms: 0.2 +/- 0.6-0.3 +/- 0.9%). This study illustrates that cathode directed more intracellular Cr(VI) reduction in the EAB and gives an alternative approach for developing imaging and functionally sensing Cr(III) ions in the MFC biocathodes.

In the context of objectification and violence, little attention has been paid to the perception neuroscience of how the human brain perceives bodies and objectifies them. Various studies point to how external cues such as appearance and attire could play a key role in encouraging objectification, dehumanization and the denial of agency. Reviewing new experimental findings across several areas of research, it seems that common threads run through issues of clothing, sexual objectification, body perception, dehumanization, and assault. Collating findings from several different lines of research, this article reviews additional evidence from cognitive and neural dynamics of person perception ( body and face perception processes) that predict downstream social behavior. Specifically, new findings demonstrate cognitive processing of sexualized female bodies as object-like, a crucial aspect of dehumanized percept devoid of agency and personhood. Sexual violence is a consequence of a dehumanized perception of female bodies that aggressors acquire through their exposure and interpretation of objectified body images. Integrating these findings and identifying triggers for sexual violence may help develop remedial measures and inform law enforcement processes and policy makers alike.	2.2
The two-dimensional (2D) incompressible Boussinesq equations model geophysical fluids and play an important role in the study of the Raleigh Bernard convection. Mathematically this 2D system retains some key features of the 3D Navier-Stokes and Euler equations such as the vortex stretching mechanism. The issue of whether the 2D Boussinesq equations always possess global (in time) classical solutions can be difficult when there is only partial dissipation or no dissipation at all. This paper obtains the global regularity for two partial dissipation cases and proves several global a priori bounds for two other prominent partial dissipation cases. These results take us one step closer to a complete resolution of the global regularity issue for all the partial dissipation cases involving the 2D Boussinesq equations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Mucosal immunity at the intestinal level is constantly challenged by the presence of external food and microbial antigens and must be kept under strict control to avoid the rise of aberrant inflammation. Among cells of the innate immunity, macrophages expressing the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 are strategically located near the gut epithelial barrier. These cells contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10; however, their role in the control of full blown inflammation and tissue injury is controversial. In this study we investigated mice proficient or deficient for the expression of the CX3CR1 receptor in a model of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) induced acute colitis. We found that KO mice (CX3CR1(GFP/GFP)) had a more severe disease compared to WT mice (CX3CR1(GFP/+)), both in terms of histological examination of colonic tissues and leukocyte infiltration, with an expansion of macrophages and CD4-Th17 lymphocytes. The expression of several inflammatory mediators (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IFN gamma, iNOS) was also significantly upregulated in KO mice, despite higher IL-10 production. Overall, our study demonstrates that macrophages expressing a functional CX3CR1 receptor have an important and non-redundant role in controlling the abnormal intestinal inflammation that may lead to tissue damage.

Here we provide an integrative review of basic control circuits, and introduce techniques by which their regulation can be quantitatively measured using human neuroimaging. We illustrate the utility of the control systems approach using four human neuroimaging threat detection studies (N = 226), to which we applied circuit-wide analyses in order to identify the key mechanism underlying individual variation. In so doing, we build upon the canonical prefrontal-limbic control system to integrate circuit-wide influence from the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). These were incorporated into a computational control systems model constrained by neuroanatomy and designed to replicate our experimental data. In this model, the IFG acts as an informational set point, gating signals between the primary prefrontal-limbic negative feedback loop and its cortical information-gathering loop. Along the cortical route, if the sensory cortex provides sufficient information to make a threat assessment, the signal passes to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), whose threat-detection threshold subsequently modulates amygdala outputs. However, if signal outputs from the sensory cortex do not provide sufficient information during the first pass, the signal loops back to the sensory cortex, with each cycle providing increasingly fine-grained processing of sensory data. Simulations replicate IFG (chaotic) dynamics experimentally observed at both ends at the threat-detection spectrum. As such, they identify distinct types of IFG disconnection from the circuit, with associated clinical outcomes. If IFG thresholds are too high, the IFG and sensory cortex cycle for too long; in the meantime the coarse-grained (excitatory) pathway will dominate, biasing ambiguous stimuli as false positives. On the other hand, if cortical IFG thresholds are too low, the inhibitory pathway will suppress the amygdala without cycling back to the sensory cortex for much-needed fine-grained sensory cortical data, biasing ambiguous stimuli as false negatives. Thus, the control systems model provides a consistent mechanism for IFG regulation, capable of producing results consistent with our data for the full spectrum of threat-detection: from fearful to optimal to reckless. More generally, it illustrates how quantitative characterization of circuit dynamics can be used to unify a fundamental dimension across psychiatric affective symptoms,	5.0
Swimming performance of spermatozoa is an important index for the success of fertilization. For many years, numerous studies have reported the optimal swimming of flagellar organisms. Nevertheless, there is still a question as to which is optimal among planar, circular helical and ellipsoidal helical beating. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to investigate the beat pattern with the best swimming efficiency based on hydrodynamic dissipation and internal torque exertion. For the parameters considered, our results show that the planar beat is optimal for small heads and the helical flagellum is optimum for a larger heads, while the ellipsoidal beat is never optimal. Also, the genetic optimization reveals that the wavenumber and shape of wave envelope are relevant parameters, whereas the wave shape and head geometry have relatively minor effects on efficiency. The optimal beat with respect to the efficiency based on the internal torque exertion of an active elastic flagellum is characterized by a small-wave number and large-amplitude wave in a lower-viscosity medium. The obtained results on the optimal waveform are consistent with observations for planar waveforms, but in many respects, the results suggest the necessity of a detailed flagellar structure-fluid interaction to address whether real spermatozoa exhibit hydrodynamically efficient swimming. The evolutional optimization approach used in this study has distinguished biologically important parameters, and the methodology can potentially be applicable to various swimmers.

The methods described herein for activation of naive CD4(+) T cells in suspension and their adherence in coverslips for confocal microscopy analysis allow the spatial localization and visualization of gangliosides involved in CD4(+) T cell activation, that complement expression profiling experiments such as flow cytometry, western blotting or real-time PCR. The quantification of ganglioside expression through flow cytometry and their cellular localization through microscopy can be obtained by the use of anti-ganglioside antibodies with high affinity and specificity. Nonetheless, an adequate handling of cells in suspension involves the treatment of culture plates to promote the necessary adherence required for fluorescence or confocal microscopy acquisition. In this work, we describe a protocol for determining GD3 and GD2 ganglioside expression and colocalization with the TCR during naive CD4(+) T cell activation. Also, real-time PCR experiments using < 40,000 cells are described for the determination of the GD3 and GM2/GD2 synthase genes, demonstrating that gene analysis experiments can be performed with a low number of cells and without the need of additional low input RNA kits.	6.3
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the proliferation of immature myeloid lineage blasts. Due to its heterogeneity and to the high rate of acquired drug resistance and relapse, new treatment strategies are needed. Here, we demonstrate that IFN promotes AML blasts to act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. Treatment with IFN drove AML blasts toward a more differentiated state, wherein they showed increased expression of the M1-related markers HLA-DR and CD86, as well as of FcRI, which mediates effector responses to therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, IFN was able to up-regulate CD38, the target of the therapeutic antibody daratumumab. Because the antigen (CD38) and effector receptor (FcRI) were both simultaneously up-regulated on the AML blasts, we tested whether IFN treatment of the AML cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11 could stimulate them to target one another after the addition of daratumumab. Results showed that IFN significantly increased daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured both by Cr-51 release and lactate dehydrogenase release assays. We also found that the combination of IFN and activation of FcR led to the release of granzyme B by AML cells. Finally, using a murine NSG model of subcutaneous AML, we found that treatment with IFN plus daratumumab significantly attenuated tumor growth. Taken together, these studies show a novel mechanism of daratumumab-mediated killing and a possible new therapeutic strategy for AML.	6.3
In this paper, we propose a communication support tool for understanding emotion in an unstable narrowband network. The tool can support mutual understanding when playing a selected voice by using also a character-based communication tool. The voice data is transmitted asynchronously and stored in local storage. Our proposed tool has been evaluated by a questionnaire survey after using some web-based voice contents classified according to some massage types and primitive emotion. From the questionnaire survey results, we discuss the effectiveness of emotional voice message when displaying text message.	2.3
Dutch adolescent second generation migrants are at increased risk of becoming marginalized and developing problem behavior. We tested the effectiveness of the Dutch multi-component empowerment program POWER that aims to prevent such problems. We hypothesized a positive intervention effect onparticipants' sense of mastery, coping skills, activities, conduct problems, and prosocial behavior. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial including a pretest and posttest with an intervention condition (n = 132) and a waitlist control condition (n = 116). Analyses showed that POWER was only effective in influencing the youngsters' participation in activities like sport, hobbies, and casual work. When implemented with high fidelity, POWER also influenced the level of conduct problems as well as their coping style. However, a more accurate registration of the implementation process would have been helpful and the program can potentially be further improved by clearly specifying which components of the program can be adapted and which must be delivered as intended.

In this paper we explore how future smart environments can be given a sense of humor. Humor requires smartness. Entering witty remarks in a conversation requires understanding of the conversation, the conversational partner, the context and the history of the conversation. We can try to model interaction smartness and how to use it in creating not only witty remarks, but also to create humorous events. Smart sensors and actuators, embedded in our environments and our wearables allow us to make changes to a digitally enhanced physical environment. Witty remarks in language can have their counterpart in witty events in digital environments, including social media environments with their own communication characteristics. Sequential and parallel juxtapositions of incongruous and contrasting events invade our communication and, in addition, can be expected to emerge or to be created in digitally enhanced physical environments too, accidentally and intentionally.	4.0
Epidemiological studies based on the hygiene hypothesis declare that the level of childhood exposure to environmental microbial products is inversely related to the incidence of allergic diseases in later life. Multiple types of immune cell-mediated immune regulation networks support the hygiene hypothesis. Epithelial cells are the first line of response to microbial products in the environment and bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems; however, their role in the hygiene hypothesis is unknown. To demonstrate the hygiene hypothesis in airway epithelial cells, we examined the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; toll-like receptor 4 ligand) on the expression of the proallergic cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and interleukin 33 (IL33) in H292 cells (pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells). Stimulation with the TLR ligand polyI:C and human parechovirus type 1 (HPeV1) but not LPS-induced TSLP and IL33 through interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-kappa B activity, which was further validated by using inhibitors (dexamethasone and Bay 11-7082) and short hairpin RNA-mediated gene knockdown. Importantly, polyI:C and HPeV1-stimulated TSLP and IL33 induction was reduced by LPS treatment by attenuating TANK-binding kinase 1, IRF3, and NF-kappa B activation. Interestingly, the basal mRNA levels of TLR signaling proteins were downregulated with long-term LPS treatment of H292 cells, which suggests that such long-term exposure modulates the expression of innate immunity signaling molecules in airway epithelial cells to mitigate the allergic response. In contrast to the effects of LPS treatment, the alarmin high-mobility group protein B1 acts in synergy with polyI:C to promote TSLP and IL33 expression. Our data support part of the hygiene hypothesis in airway epithelia cells in vitro. In addition to therapeutic targeting of TSLP and IL33, local application of non-pathogenic LPS may be a rational strategy to prevent allergies.	5.1
Gene editing technologies are a group of recent innovations in plant breeding using molecular biology, which have in common the capability of introducing a site-directed mutation or deletion in the genome. The first cases of crops improved with these technologies are approaching the market; this has raised an international debate regarding if they should be regulated as genetically modified crops or just as another form of mutagenesis under conventional breeding. This dilemma for policymakers not only entails issues pertaining safety information and legal/regulatory definitions. It also demands borrowing tools developed in the field of social studies of science and technology, as an additional basis for sound decision making.	6.0
Invasive trophoblast from Day 34 horse conceptuses survives in extrauterine sites in allogeneic recipients that are immunologically naive to donor major histocompatibility complex class I antigens. The ectopic trophoblast retains its in utero characteristics, including similar lifespan, physiologic effect of its secreted product (equine chorionic gonadotropin) upon the recipient's ovaries, and induction of host immune responses. Immunologic memory has not been considered previously in this experimental system. We hypothesized that primary exposure to ectopic trophoblast would affect the recipient's immune status such that the survival time of subsequent transplants would be altered. Secondary transplant lifespans could be shortened by destructive memory responses, as has been observed in ectopic trophoblast studies in rodents, or lengthened, as occurs when male skin grafts follow multiple syngeneic pregnancies in mice. Eight mares received two closely spaced trophoblast transplants. Both grafts for each recipient were obtained from conceptuses sired by the same stallion to provide consistency in histocompatibility antigen exposure. Donor stallions were major histocompatibility complex class I homozygotes. Cytotoxic antibody production was tracked to monitor recipients' immune responses to the transplants. Detection of serum equine chorionic gonadotropin was used as a proxy for transplant lifespan. There was no significant difference between the distributions of primary and secondary transplant lifespans, despite evidence of immunologic memory. These data demonstrate that secondary ectopic trophoblast transplants in horses do not experience earlier destruction or prolonged survival following immune priming of recipients. Mechanisms responsible for the eventual demise of the transplants remain unperturbed by secondary immune responses or chronic antigenic exposure.	6.3
Complex systems that increasingly involves devices such as sensors, smart-phone, interconnected objects and computers, results in what is called ambient systems. One of today's challenges in the framework of ubiquitous computing concerns the design of ambient systems. The major difficulty is to propose a compositional adaptation of devices which appear/despair over time. WComp environment is a prototyping and dynamic execution environment for ambient intelligence applications including a management mechanism allowing extensible interference between devices. A new approach based on the definition of strategies validated using discrete-event simulation is proposed in order to take into account conflicts and compositional adaptation of devices in ambient systems. These are defined and validate using a DEVS ( Discrete EVent system Specification) formalism to be integrated into a prototyping and dynamic execution environment for ambient intelligence applications. The proposed solution allows the designers of ambient systems to define the optimum matching of all components to each other. One pedagogical example is presented ( switch-lamp system) as a proof of the proposed approach.	4.0
In remote sensing, estimation of the forest stand height is an ever-challenging issue due to the difficulties encountered during the acquisition of data under forest canopies. Stereo optical imaging offers high spatial and spectral resolution; however, the optical correlation is lower in dense forests than in open areas due to an insufficient number of matching points. Therefore, in most cases height information may be missing or faulty. With their long wavelengths of 0.2 to 1.3 m, P-band and L-band synthetic aperture radars are capable of penetrating forest canopies, but their low spatial resolutions restrict the use of single-tree based forest applications. In this study, airborne laser scanning was used as an effective remote sensing technique to produce large-scale maps of forest stand height. This technique produces very high-resolution point clouds and has a high penetration capability that allows for the detection of multiple echoes per laser pulse. A study area with a forest coverage of approximately 60% was selected in Houston, USA, and a three-dimensional color-coded map of forest stands was produced using a normalized digital surface model technique. Rather than being limited to the number of ground control points, the accuracy of the produced map was assessed with a model-to-model approach using terrestrial laser scanning. In the accuracy assessment, the standard deviation was used as the main accuracy indicator in addition to the root mean square error and normalized median absolute deviation. The absolute geo-location accuracy of the generated map was found to be better than 1 cm horizontally and approximately 40 cm in height. Furthermore, the effects of bias and relative standard deviations were determined. The problems encountered during the production of the map, as well as recommended solutions, are also discussed in this paper.	4.2
Human gait recognition, an active research topic in computer vision, is generally based on data obtained from images/videos. We applied computer vision technology to classify pathology-related changes in gait in young children using a foot-pressure database collected using the GAITRite walkway system. As foot positioning changes with children's development, we also investigated the possibility of age estimation based on this data. Our results demonstrate that the data collected by the GAITRite system can be used for normal/pathological gait classification. Combining age information and normal/pathological gait classification increases the accuracy of the classifier. This novel approach could support the development of an accurate, real-time, and economic measure of gait abnormalities in children, able to provide important feedback to clinicians regarding the effect of rehabilitation interventions, and to support targeted treatment modifications.	0.0
It was investigated the physical processes in the molecules, which have properties required in case of using as molecular switches, transistors, or other electronic elements of future computers. Studies show that in the molecules of biphenyl substituents the angle between the planes of the phenyl rings depends on the magnitude of the applied external electric field. So, the ratio of squares of cosines of the angles between the phenyl groups in the field 0.01 a.u. and without field reaches 18. It significantly changes the ability of electrons to move along the long axis of the molecule. By varying the nature of the substituents, we can obtain the molecule characteristics that make these molecules promising for future using. This effect provides the use of biphenyl substitutes as transistors in electrical circuits constructed on separate molecules.	1.2
The thermal conductivities of powdered and granular bentonite based needle punched geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) were investigated at different gravimetric water contents under 25, 50, 75, and 100 kPa vertical stresses. Both types of GCLs exhibited an increase in thermal conductivity with increasing vertical stress at all water contents. The effect of vertical stresses was more pronounced for the specimens hydrated at lower gravimetric water contents and this was attributed to their high initial volumetric air content. The variability of water distribution in partially hydrated GCLs has been identified as a factor that may affect their thermal conductivity. The forms of bentonites (i.e., powder or granular) affected their thermal conductivities; however, this effect was less apparent at higher gravimetric water contents due to the reduced air content and gel formation in the bentonites. Finally, the GCL thermal conductivity calculated from the measured thermal conductivities of its various constituents (i.e geotextile and bentonite) components differed from the measured values. This was attributed to the nonuniform water distribution across the GCL specimen and change in material properties when components of GCL were disassembled.	4.1
Wealth is associated with differences in people's self-concepts. We propose that these self-concepts should define the types of appeals that are most effective at motivating generosity. Across three field studies, we randomly assigned participants to view an appeal for a charitable organization that emphasized agency (the pursuit of personal goals) or communion (the pursuit of shared goals). When the appeal emphasized agency, wealthier individuals reported greater willingness to give and donated more money to charity. In contrast, when the appeal emphasized communion, less wealthy individuals reported greater willingness to give. These findings could not be explained by relevant demographic characteristics such as age, ethnicity, or gender. This work adds to a growing body of research suggesting that wealth does not inherently result in selfishness or generosity. By tailoring messages to fit with people's self-concepts, it is possible to catalyze giving across the socioeconomic spectrum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.4
Vitamin D is a molecule that is actively involved in multiple metabolic pathways. It is mostly known for its implications related to calcium metabolism. It has also been determined that it actively participates in the cardiovascular system, influencing blood pressure, coronary artery disease and other vascular diseases, such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, it has been established that this vitamin is extensively involved in the regulation of both the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and the immune system. In this review, we present the different vitamin D metabolic pathways associated with the cardiovascular pathophysiology, and we include studies in animal and human models, as well as some of the controversies found in the literature. This review also incorporates an overview of the implications in the molecular biology and public health fields.	6.0

Herein, we present a fully integrated electronic product code (EPC) Gen-2 compatible battery-assisted passive (BAP) radio-frequency identification sensor tag integrated circuit (IC) with efficient power management. The key components of the tag IC include an adaptive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvester, a battery access controller (BAC), a storage capacitor charger, and a power-gated sensor block. External RF energy is efficiently harvested using dynamically controlled rectifying stages and a threshold-compensation technique. The BAC tightly controls the power path, cutting off leakage current from the battery. The power-gated sensor block supports multiplexed sensing operations in a power efficient manner. The sensor interface includes a chopper amplifier, a programmable gain amplifier, multiplexers, and an 8-bit ADC. For sensing data logging, custom designed nonvolatile memory is employed via one-time programmable memory. The digital control block is based on an EPCglobal Gen-2 standard that is modified to support the sensing operation. The tag chip was fabricated in a 1-poly 6-metal standard 0.18-mu m standard CMOS process. The tag IC consumes 1 mu A for leakage and active operation (0.1% duty), and the estimated lifespan of the BAP tag IC is about 0.2 year/mA.h.	1.4
Growing attention in mature T-cell lymphomas/leukemias (MTCL) is committed to more accurate and meaningful classifications, improved pathogenetic concepts and expanded therapeutic options. This requires considerations of the immunologic concepts of T-cell homeostasis and the specifics of T-cell receptor (TCR) affinities and signaling. Scientists from various disciplines established the CONTROL-T research unit and in an international conference on MTCL they brought together experts from T-cell immunity, oncology, immunotherapy and systems biology. We report here meeting highlights on the covered topics of diagnostic pitfalls, implications by the new WHO classification, insights from discovered genomic lesions as well as TCR-centric concepts of cellular dynamics in host defense, auto-immunity and tumorigenic clonal escape, including predictions to be derived from in vivo imaging and mathematical modeling. Presentations on novel treatment approaches were supplemented by strategies of optimizing T-cell immunotherapies. Work packages, that in joint efforts would advance the field of MTCL more efficiently, are identified.	6.3
Lightweight multi-kernel architectures, where HPC specialized lightweight kernels (LWKs) run side-by-side with Linux on compute nodes, have received a great deal of attention recently due to their potential for addressing many of the challenges system software faces as we move towards exascale and beyond. LWKs in multi-kernels implement only a limited set of kernel functionality and the rest is supported by Linux, for example, device drivers for high-performance interconnects. While most of the operations of modern high-performance interconnects are driven entirely by user-space, memory registration for remote direct memory access (RDMA) usually involves interaction with the Linux device driver and thus comes at the price of service offloading. In this paper we introduce various optimizations for multi-kernel LWKs to eliminate the memory registration cost. In particular, we propose a safe RDMA pre-registration mechanism combined with lazy memory unmapping in the LWK. We demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude improvement in RDMA registration latency and up to 15% improvement on MPI_ Allreduce() for large message sizes.	0.4

The system includes a methodology to perform a series of evaluations about theoretical and practical knowledge which allows the student self-learning. The data obtained with the proposed system are analyzed and the effect on student results is discussed. The evolution in time of the student grades, their involvement and satisfaction with the project, and its influence in their final score are presented.	3.2
Fluidic artificial muscles are popular in robotics and function as biomimetic actuators. Their pneumatic version has been widely investigated. A novel water hydraulic artificial muscle (WHAM) with high strength is developed in this study. WHAMs can be applied to underwater manipulators widely used in ocean development because of their environment-friendly characteristics, high force-to-weight ratio, and good bio-imitability. Therefore, the strength of WHAMs has been improved to fit the requirements of underwater environments and the work pressure of water hydraulic components. However, understanding the mechanical behaviors of WHAMs is necessary because WHAMs use work media and pressure control that are different from those used by pneumatic artificial muscles. This paper presents the static and dynamic characteristics of the WHAM system, including the water hydraulic pressure control circuit. A test system is designed and built to analyze the drive characteristics of the developed WHAM. The theoretical relationships among the amount of contraction, pressure, and output drawing force of the WHAM are tested and verified. A linearized transfer function is proposed, and the dynamic characteristics of the WHAM are investigated through simulation and inertia load experiments. Simulation results agree with the experimental results and show that the proposed model can be applied to the control of WHAM actuators.	3.1
The surface-layers have very high water content and low bearing capacity, so far to be the very soft clay foundation, which come from the reclaimed land in project of reclamation. It is difficult to improve the very soft clay foundation by traditional vacuum preloading. A new method named surface soft soil improvement is presented in this paper, which can make the soft clay foundation to be improved in preliminary. Once forming the hard coat layer, the foundation may reach the needs of further construction. In the construction technology, the horizontal filter pipe net is used to instead of the sand bedding course. By laying of woven cloth and non-woven geotextile over the surface of reclaimed silt, installing PVDs by manpower becomes possible. Besides, the vertical PVDs all are connected with the horizontal filter pipe net directly, that makes a whole spatial drainage system. The loss of the degree of vacuum is decreased, and the improvement is increased. Thus, this construction technology is as a reference to the large scale engineering construction and similar projects.	4.1
Given the facts that a vast area of the earth is covered by water and the average depth of the oceans is more than 3,000 m, the issue of the unknowns beneath the water surface is a challenging and questionable one. It has been a few decades since remotely operated vehicles as well as untethered underwater robots have appeared and elevated the level of complex engineering. In this category, underwater robots that mimic fish and aquatic creatures open new horizons. In this article, imitating the body shape, kinematics, and swimming mechanism of a batoid fish (Dasyatidae), a vessel is designed that can swim at an acceptable speed with a limited amount of power. The hull shape is based on a cardioid curve, and drag force is calculated using fundamentals of fluid mechanics. Propulsion of the robot-fish is two wings at starboard and port that are undulating backward; thrust is approximated versus shaft speed. Finally, the power for swimming at the design speed is evaluated and compared with the available data of similar orders of magnitude.	3.4
Energy recovery both from the economic aspects and also from sustainable the use of energy, is necessitated with an optimal operational of equipment's inside the building. A Synchronous Monitoring and Real Time analysis system using an integrated monitor and control of energy recovery is presented. The test vicinity taken for this approach is based on the analysis of energy usage and the bill pay by the Taylor's University Malaysia. We have scaled down the approach to a test area restricted to a room design and employing the new methodology to optimize the energy usage. The design of this system is based on analysing the energy wastage caused by human factors and the utility usage factor. The system design proposes a real time monitoring of not just load but also the health condition of various equipment and physical environment condition, as they are the other major source for the operational inefficiency. By performing utilities usage control using SMART system, the electricity saving is expected to be 22.13 %.	3.3
The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), is one of the major pests of rice throughout Asia. Extensive use of insecticides for suppressing N. lugens has resulted in the development of insecticide resistance leading to frequent control failures in the field. The aim of the present study was to evaluate resistance in the field populations of N. lugens from major rice growing states of South India to various insecticides. We also determined the activity of detoxifying enzymes (esterases [ESTs], glutathione S-transferases [GSTs], and mixed-function oxidases [MFOs]). Moderate levels of resistance were detected in the field populations to acephate, thiamethoxam and buprofezin (resistance factors 1.05-20.92 fold, 4.52-14.99 fold, and 1.00-18.09 fold, respectively) as compared with susceptible strain while there were low levels of resistance to imidacloprid (resistance factor 1.23-6.70 fold) and complete sensitivity to etofenoprox (resistance factor 1.05-1.66 fold). EST activities in the field populations were 1.06 to 3.09 times higher than the susceptible strain while for GST and MFO the ratios varied from 1.29 to 3.41 and 1.03 to 1.76, respectively. The EST activity was found to be correlated to acephate resistance (r = 0.999, P 0.001). The high selection pressure of organophosphate, neonicotinoid, and insect growth regulator (IGR) in the field is likely to be contributing for resistance in BPH to multiple insecticides, leading to control failures. The results obtained will be beneficial to IPM recommendations for the use of effective insecticides against BPH.	6.0
Recently, concerns have been raised that adolescents' prolific social media use may cause them to become less empathic. However, direct empirical evidence is missing and research suggests that social media use can also be beneficial for adolescents' psychosocial development. The present study aims to investigate whether and how social media use influences empathy. We surveyed 942 Dutch adolescents (10-14 years) twice, with a one-year interval. The results showed that social media use is related to an increase in cognitive and affective empathy over time. Specifically, adolescents' social media use improved both their ability to understand (cognitive empathy) and share the feelings of their peers (affective empathy). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by typically an axial arthritis. AS is the prototype of a group of disorders called spondyloarthropathies, which is believed to have common clinical manifestations and genetic predisposition. To date, the exact etiology of AS remains unclear. Over the past few years, however, the role of genetic susceptibility and epigenetic modifications caused through environmental factors have been extensively surveyed with respect to the pathogenesis of AS, resulted in important advances. This review article focuses on the recent advances in the field of AS research, including HLA and non-HLA susceptibility genes identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and aberrant epigenetic modifications of gene loci associated with AS. HLA genes most significantly linked with AS susceptibility include HLA-B27 and its subtypes. Numerous non-HLA genes such as those in ubiquitination, aminopeptidases and MHC class I presentation molecules like ERAP-1 were also reported. Moreover, epigenetic modifications occurred in AS has been summarized. Taken together, the findings presented in this review attempt to explain the circumstance by which both genetic variations and epigenetic modifications are involved in triggering and development of AS. Nonetheless, several unanswered dark sides continue to clog our exhaustive understanding of AS. Future researches in the field of epigenetics should be carried out to extend our vision of AS etiopathogenesis.	5.3
In this paper, we review a previous research paper presenting a scheme for quantum key distribution that performs authentication using only quantum means. The authentication mechanism in the protocol runs along with an eavesdropping checking approach. To upgrade security properties, especially against man-in-the-middle attack, we propose a revised and enhanced scheme, so that the probability of detecting eavesdropping is distinctly improved. We use prism tool as a model checker to analyze the security of the quantum system and to emphasize the extent of our contribution. We particularly focus on two security features: (i) the capability of the participants in the protocol to detect any eavesdropping attempt and (ii) any valid knowledge gained on the shared key must be minimized.

Severe water pollution is among the top policy priorities in both China and India. This paper undertakes a comparative case analysis to examine efforts in combating river pollution in two major rivers - the Yangtze in China and the Ganga in India. Our analysis suggests that efforts in combating river pollution in the two Asian giants have encountered substantial challenges, such as the lack of comprehensive legal mechanisms to control pollution at the basin level, the lack of coordination among multiple government agencies, and significant gaps in policy implementation. Our analysis also points out considerable differences between China and India in institutional structure, regulatory approaches and policy instruments in dealing with river pollution.	4.4
Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises unconditionally secure communications, however, the low bit rate of QKD cannot meet the requirements of high-speed applications. Despite the many solutions that have been proposed in recent years, they are neither efficient to generate the secret keys nor compatible with other QKD systems. This paper, based on chaotic cryptography and middleware technology, proposes an efficient and universal QKD protocol that can be directly deployed on top of any existing QKD system without modifying the underlying QKD protocol and optical platform. It initially takes the bit string generated by the QKD system as input, periodically updates the chaotic system, and efficiently outputs the bit sequences. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our protocol can efficiently increase the bit rate of the QKD system as well as securely generate bit sequences with perfect statistical properties. Compared with the existing methods, our protocol is more efficient and universal, it can be rapidly deployed on the QKD system to increase the bit rate when the QKD system becomes the bottleneck of its communication system.	0.3
The geotextile industry research and development is growing at a fast rate and new products of variable specifications are now available for earthworks and design engineers. The polypropylene fiber material is non-biodegradable which can stand aggressive chemical exposure when placed along with soil media. This research is conducted on a polypropylene fiber reinforced soil treated with chemical admixture in order to study the interlocking mechanism and to study the extent of improvement on their tensile behaviour. Locally available plastic clay was selected for this investigation. The extent of improvement by the polypropylene fibres inclusion on the tensile behaviour was evaluated by carrying out a series of Brazilian tensile strength tests. The dominant mechanism responsible for the increase in tensile strength properties has been proposed. The effect of various geotechnical parameters like grain size distribution, density and moisture content on the tensile strength improvement has been discussed. The study shows that the addition of polypropylene fibers alone to highly plastic clay will not suffice the tensile strength requirements. The polypropylene fibers when added with lime of 6% can improve the tensile strength by further 13 to 28% depending on the dose or fiber content.	4.1
This paper describes a modular architecture based on the dual-active bridge (DAB) converter in input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) connection. This work is focused on the input voltage sharing to ensure a proper operation of each module by means of an active control of input and output voltages. A small-signal model of the modular architecture is proposed and a decoupled control loops' scheme is used to implement the control strategy. An experimental setup has been built in order to validate the model of the DAB converter in ISOP connection and the proposed control strategy, taking different operating conditions and constructive parameter values into account.	1.4
CASE: Kendra is a 4-year-old girl with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who presents for follow-up of feeding problems to her pediatric clinician. She is an only child in a family where both parents are scientists. Feeding concerns date to infancy, when she was diagnosed with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) associated with persistent bottle refusal and the acceptance of few pureed foods. At 13 months, milk and peanut allergies were diagnosed. Following a feeding clinic evaluation at 24 months, she was prescribed a soy milk supplement and an H2 blocker. There was no concern for oral-motor dysfunction. She was also referred to early intervention for feeding therapy. However, her parents terminated participation after 6 months because she became anxious and had tantrum prior to treatment groups. She was seen in another feeding program at 3 years; zinc, folate, thyroid, and a celiac panel were normal, and an endoscopy was negative for eosinophilic esophagitis. She began individual feeding therapy, where concerns for rigidity, difficulty transitioning, and limited peer interactions led to a neuropsychological evaluation. Kendra was diagnosed with an ASD and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Her cognitive skills were average, and expressive and receptive language skills were low average. Her diet consisted of French fries, Ritz crackers, pretzels, and 32 ounces of soy formula daily. She had stopped accepting Cheerios and saltines 2 months prior. She controlled other aspects of feeding, insisting on a specific parking spot at a fast food restaurant and drinking from a particular sippy cup. Her parents accepted these demands with concern about her caloric intake, which they tracked daily. Following diagnosis with ARFID, she resumed feeding therapy using a systematic desensitization approach with rewards. At the first session, she kissed and licked 2 new foods without gagging. Her mother appeared receptive to recommendations that included continuing the food game at home, replacing 1 ounce of soy formula by offering water each day, limiting between-meal grazing, and refusing specific feeding demands. Currently, her parents plan to discontinue feeding therapy with concerns that the treatment was too harsh. Her father produces logs of her caloric and micronutrient intake as evidence that she did not replace missed formula with other foods and reports that she subsequently became more difficult to manage behaviorally. Her father now demands to see randomized controlled trials of feeding therapy approaches. Her weight is stable, but she has now limited her pretzel intake to a specific brand. How would you approach her continued care?	5.1
Developing a large, but smart environment is a complex task that requires the collaboration of experts of different disciplines. How to successfully attain such collaboration is not a trivial matter. The paper illustrates the problem with a case study where the manager of the facility intends to influence pedestrians so that they choose a task that requires certain effort, e.g. using staircases, instead of the current one that requires less effort, e.g. using the elevator. Defining requirements for such scenarios requires a strong multidisciplinary collaboration which is not currently well supported. This paper contributes with an approach to provide non-technician experts with tools so that they can provide feedback on the requirements and verify them in a systematic way.	4.0
Especially for seniors, Ambient Intelligence can provide assistance in daily living and emergency situations, for example by automatically recognizing critical situations. The use of such systems may involve trade-offs with regard to privacy, social stigmatization, and changes of the well-known living environment. This raises the question of how older adults perceive restrictions of privacy, accept technology, and which requirements are placed on Ambient Intelligent systems. In order to better understand the related concerns and expectations, we surveyed 60 senior citizens. The results show that experience with Ambient Intelligence increases technology acceptance and reduces fears regarding privacy violations and insufficient system reliability. While participants generally tolerate a monitoring of activities in their home, including bathrooms, they do not accept commercial service providers as data recipients. A comparison between four exemplary systems shows that camera-based solutions are perceived with much greater fears than wearable emergency solutions. Burglary detection was rated as similarly important assigned as health features, whereas living comfort features were considered less useful.	4.0
This paper describes the design, measurement methodology, and experimental validation of an electronic system for monitoring the electrical discontinuity in rails of double-track railway lines in order to detect the rail breakage. The electronic system is based on an emitter node and on the two receiver nodes. The three nodes, together with the four rails to be analyzed, constitute the electrical circuits, whose currents are measured in both the emission and reception nodes. These nodes can communicate through a data network between them, as well as with a remote center that controls and synchronizes the electronic systems along the railway line. The electronic subsystem associated with the emitter node transmits an encoded signal to the rails, modulated by an 800-Hz carrier. A set of eight currents are measured, one per rail at each end of the section defined between the emitter and the receiver, with a maximum length of 7 km. The evaluation of electrical discontinuities in each section is carried out by means of the relative imbalances that can appear between the eight measured currents, according to possible breakages. The method of measurement is characterized by a high immunity to noise. The results presented here are based on a railway line prototype, which implements the electrical propagation models and coupling between the four rails in the double track. This model allows the proposed electronic system and measurement methodology to be successfully verified.	1.2
Sustainable rural food systems for poor and vulnerable people need to be locally adapted to enhance food security. This requires participatory action research that considers the entire food value chain (FVC). This paper presents an assessment of the feasibility and potential success of upgrading strategies (UPS) for enhancing food security based on a study that was part of a larger participatory research project in two regions of Tanzania. The authors present the results relating to natural resource management and crop production. The results for natural resources show that enhanced soil water management was rated as high for the semi-arid Dodoma region. For the Morogoro region, the experts favoured soil fertility-improving UPS, such as conservation agriculture and agroforestry. Assessments of food production for both regions indicated the importance of intercropping, manure input, pest and disease control and cover crops. Assessments differed greatly between the two different climatic regions, and to a lesser extent between the nationality of the experts and their gender. This highlights the importance of including different South-North and female-male awareness in assessments. Implementation feasibility assessments of UPS indicated that the most suitable approaches were rainwater harvesting for semi-arid and conservation agriculture for subhumid regions respectively. Local and/or regional stakeholders and experts should be involved in developing and assessing site-adapted UPS for enhancing Tanzanian FVCs.	4.3
Developing robust and recyclable absorbents for water purification is of great demand to control water pollution and to provide sustainable water resources. Herein, for the first time, we reported the fabrication of Kevlar nanofiber (KNF) based composite particles for water purification. Both the KNF and KNF-carbon nanotube composite particles can be produced in large-scale by automatic injection of casting solution into ethanol. The resulted nanofibrous particles showed high adsorption capacities towards various pollutants, including metal ions, phenylic compounds and various dyes. Meanwhile, the adsorption process towards dyes was found to fit well with the pseudo-second-order model, while the adsorption speed was controlled by intraparticle diffusion. Furthermore, the adsorption capacities of the nanofibrous particles could be easily recovered by washing with ethanol. In general, the KNF based particles integrate the advantages of easy production, robust and effective adsorption performances, as well as good recyclability, which can be used as robust absorbents to remove toxic molecules and forward the application of absorbents in water purification.

Photovoltaic (PV) cell plays crucial role to utilize the solar energy. The regional differences in the PV industry have created unbalanced flows of PV cells. This paper examined patterns of the PV cells international trade from spatial and temporal perspectives. Data sources are regional monetary importexport tables and the world renewable energy statistics in 1996-2015. Based on the Haggett's cognitive model of spatial structure, the patterns and evolution characteristics are identified with an aid of ArcGIS. This study revealed most PV cells exporters are distributed in East Asia and Southeast Asia intensively whereas relatively balanced exports are presented in Europe and North American in recent years. Most PV cells are flowing from east to west while the pattern of PV cells international trade has transformed from single-pole to multi-pole. Meanwhile, the international trade intensity of PV cells grew steadily at the global scale, and evolution features of PV cells trades varied from region to region. Economics conditions, incentive policy and producers' demand are three critical factors. These findings provide a useful reference for identifying the intensity, orientation, main connections and development trend of traders. Moreover, the PV industrial practitioners can benefit from this research to develop corresponding international business strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
Extreme apprenticeship, a recent learning methodology, was used in a blended fashion for teaching a technical subject: Bash scripting for operating systems. Online learning was supported with the Moodle platform, in particular, for managing Bash programming exercises. How did students behave? Were the exercises equally difficult for them? If not, where did differences arise? And why? This paper reports on the design of a blended learning experience for Bash programming, focusing on the definition and evaluation of levels of programming exercises and on students behavior in programming, supported by Moodle.

Background: Studies of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and late-life depression (LLD) have examined the similarities and differences between these syndromes, but few have investigated how the cognitive profile of comorbid aMCI and subclinical depressive symptoms (aMCI/D+) may compare to that of aMCI or LLD. Memory biases for certain types of emotional information may distinguish these groups. Methods: A total of 35 aMCI, 23 aMCI/D+, 13 LLD, and 17 elderly controls (CONT) rated the valence (positive, negative, or neutral) of 30 pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Mean percent positive, negative, and neutral images recalled was compared within groups immediately and 30 minutes later. Results: Overall memory performance was comparable in aMCI and aMCI/D+, and both recalled fewer items than CONT and LLD. Group differences emerged when valence ratings were considered: at immediate and delayed recall, positive and negative pictures were generally better-remembered than neutral pictures by CONT, aMCI, and LLD, but valence was not associated with recall in aMCI/D+. Follow-up analyses suggested that the perceived intensity of stimuli may explain the emotional enhancement effect in CONT, aMCI, and LLD. Conclusions: Results support previous research suggesting that the neuropsychological profile of aMCI/D+ is different from that of aMCI and LLD. Although depressed and non-depressed individuals with aMCI recall comparable quantities of information, the quality of the recalled information differs significantly. On theoretical grounds, this suggests the existence of distinct neurobiological or neurofunctional manifestations in both groups. Practically, these differences may guide the development of personalized emotion-focused encoding strategies in cognitive training programs.	5.2
The Door-in-the-Face (DITF) sequential message strategy was investigated in a threestudy analysis of existing experimental findings. The current study predicted there would be a positive relationship between concession size and compliance rates in DITF studies. Study 1 included 25 comparisons where size of concession was quantifiable as measured by percentage reduction from initial to target request in the DITF condition. Study 2 data relied on a panel of undergraduate students to provide an index of concession size in 12 additional observations. A third study validated the panel procedure of rating concession size and also provided 9 additional independent observations from the pool of published studies on DITF. Results from each study indicated a positive relationship between concession size and effect size (r = 0.35, 0.55, 0.68, respectively). Study findings provide support for reciprocal concessions explanation for DITF effects.	2.1
This research was performed to investigate the behavior of geosynthetic-reinforced sandy soil foundations and to study the effect of different parameters contributing to their performance using laboratory model tests. The parameters investigated in this study included top layer spacing, number of reinforcement layers, vertical spacing between layers, tensile modulus and type of geosynthetic reinforcement, embedment depth, and shape of footing. The effect of geosynthetic reinforcement on the vertical stress distribution in the sand and the strain distribution along the reinforcement were also investigated. The test results demonstrated the potential benefit of using geosynthetic-reinforced sand foundations. The test results also showed that the reinforcement configuration layout has a very significant effect on the behavior of reinforced sand foundation. With two or more layers of reinforcement, the settlement can be reduced by 2000 at all footing pressure levels. Sand reinforced by the composite of geogrid and geotextile performed better than those reinforced by geogrid or geotextile alone. The inclusion of reinforcement can redistribute the applied footing load to a more uniform pattern, hence reducing the stress concentration, which will result reduced settlement. Finally, the results of model tests were compared with the analytical solution developed by the authors in previous studies; and the analytical solution gave a good predication of the experimental results of footing on geosynthetic reinforced sand.

In a Sidonian sarcophagus, from the Late Antique/early Christian period, skeletal remains of two persons were found. One of them, male, 30-50 years old, was found almost completely ankylosed, with highly osteoporotic bones and prominent erosion of joint surfaces. We diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis based on the eroded odontoid process, mandibular condyles, distal humerus, proximal and distal ulna, as well ankylosed hand and foot bones. Despite the fact that ankyloses of vertebrae and sacroiliac joint could point towards ankylosing spondylitis, the lack of typical vertebral ankyloses and new bone formation led to exclusion. In a practical sense, due to the advanced stage of the disease, the man was fixed in the supine position, on the left, with his head turned to the right. Apparently, he could not move and had problems with chewing and breathing. But, the high standard of provided healthcare probably enabled him to survive in advanced stages of the disease. This case shed light on the antiquity of the disease, its medical, and social context and provided the example of most extreme osteological changes reported in the paleopathological and medical literature.	5.3
Hydroxycinnamic acids are antioxidant phenolic compounds which are widespread in plant foods, contribute significantly to total polyphenol intakes, and are absorbed by humans. The extent of their putative health benefit in vivo depends largely on their bioavailability. However, the mechanisms of absorption and metabolism of these phenolic compounds have not been described. In this study, we used the in vitro Caco-2 model of human small intestinal epithelium to investigate the metabolism of the major dietary hydroxycinnamates (ferulate, sinapate, p-coumarate, and caffeate) and of diferulates. The appearance of metabolites in the medium versus time was monitored, and the various conjugates and derivatives produced were identified by HPLC-DAD, LC/MS, and enzyme treatment with beta-glucuronidase or sulfatase. Enterocyte-like differentiated Caco-2 cells have extra- and intracellular esterases able to de-esterify hydroxycinnamate and diferulate esters. In addition, intracellular UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases existing in Caco-2 cells are able to form the sulfate and the glucuronide conjugates of methyl ferulate, methyl sinapate, methyl caffeate, and methyl p-coumarate. However, only the sulfate conjugates of the free acids, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid, were detected after 24 h. The O-methylated derivatives, ferulic and isoferulic acid, were the only metabolites detected following incubation of Caco-2 cells with caffeic acid. These results show that the in vitro model system differentiated Caco-2 cells have the capacity to metabolize dietary hydroxycinnamates, including various phase I (de-esterification) and phase II (glucuronidation, sulfation, and O-methylation) reactions, and suggests that the human small intestinal epithelium plays a role in the metabolism and bioavailability of these phenolic compounds.	6.2
We present a noncontact method to measure ballistocardiogram (BCG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) simultaneously using a single camera. The method tracks the motion of facial features to determine displacement BCG, and extracts the corresponding velocity and acceleration BCGs by taking first and second temporal derivatives from the displacement BCG, respectively. The measured BCG waveforms are consistent with those reported in the literature and also with those recorded with an accelerometer-based reference method. The method also tracks PPG based on the reflected light from the same facial region, which makes it possible to track both BCG and PPG with the same optics. We verify the robustness and reproducibility of the noncontact method with a small pilot study with 23 subjects. The presented method is the first demonstration of simultaneous BCG and PPG monitoring without wearing any extra equipment or marker by the subject.	4.2
The dynamics of a population undergoing selection is a central topic in evolutionary biology. This question is particularly intriguing in the case where selective forces act in opposing directions at two population scales. For example, a fast-replicating virus strain outcompetes slower-replicating strains at the within-host scale. However, if the fast-replicating strain causes host morbidity and is less frequently transmitted, it can be outcompeted by slower-replicating strains at the between-host scale. Here we consider a stochastic ball-and-urn process which models this type of phenomenon. We prove the weak convergence of this process under two natural scalings. The first scaling leads to a deterministic nonlinear integro-partial differential equation on the interval [0,1] with dependence on a single parameter, lambda. We show that the fixed points of this differential equation are Beta distributions and that their stability depends on lambda and the behavior of the initial data around 1. The second scaling leads to a measure-valued Fleming-Viot process, an infinite dimensional stochastic process that is frequently associated with a population genetics.	6.4
Developing highly active photocatalysts for water treatment is of vital importance. A large-mesopore hierarchical WO3 hydrate photocatalyst with exposed high energy facets was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using sodium chloride as structure-directing agent. The forming model of the hierarchical structure was discussed, and photogenerated oxide species were investigated. It is shown that the orthorhombic WO3 center dot 1/3H(2)O photocatalyst is of a hierarchical structure assembled by various 2-dimension nanosheets and that its average pore diameter reaches approximately 33.2 nm. Besides, it could decompose 92% of rhodamine B (Rh B) under visible light irradiation within four hours. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the exposed high energy (002) crystal facets of hierarchical structure, and to the large mesopores existing between crossed nanosheets which help to charge carriers separation, adsorption of reactants and desorption of product molecules. Furthermore, the catalyst displays an excellent photocatalytic stability, indicating its broad application in water pollution treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.4
Background: The amounts of vitamin A that are metabolically derived from specific carotene-containing foods are largely unknown. Objective: We sought to develop an improved method for estimating the metabolic vitamin A potential of provitamin A carotenoids by using [H-2(4)]retinyl acetate (d(4)-RA) as an extrinsic reference standard. Design: Healthy subjects consumed a standardized test meal containing 6 mg beta -carotene as either raw carrot or spinach, either 20 or 1 g added fat, and 6.0 mu mol d(4)-RA. Concentrations of unlabeled (d(0)) retinyl esters (RE), labeled (d(4)) RE, and carotenoids in the plasma triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein fraction (d<1.006 kg/L) were determined in serial blood samples with HPLC and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Baseline-corrected areas under the curve for d(0)-RE, d(4)-RE, and carotenoids were calculated, and the masses of absorbed do-retinol and carotenes were estimated assuming 80% absorption of the d(4)-RA reference dose. Results: In trials with ample (20 g) fat (n=6), 74% of the 6 mg beta -carotene ingested was taken up as beta -carotene plus RE with 0.3 +/-0.1 mg as retinol. Test meals without carotenes yielded no beta -carotene or d(0)-RE response and there was no effect of treatment (either fat amount or vegetable, n=6) on the mean d(4)-RE area under the curve. The lower-than-expected vitamin A yields were attributed to poor intestinal uptake rather than to low conversion of beta -carotene to RE. Conclusion: The triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein and d(4)-RA method, which controls for variation in chylomicron kinetics in vivo and RE recovery during analysis, is useful for obtaining quantitative estimates of the vitamin A potential of single meals.	6.2
Two nationwide representative studies (N5653 adolescents; N51007 adults) investigated the psychological correlates of the intention to penalize public expressions of prejudice in the form of support for hate-speech prohibition. We presented participants with preselected examples of hate speech from the Internet and other mass media and assessed their willingness to support the prohibition of public expressions of such remarks. Both studies found that social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism are positively correlated with outgroup prejudice, but they have differential effects on hate-speech prohibition. Social dominance orientation was positively related to the acceptance of hate speech, whereas right-wing authoritarianism was positively related to hate-speech prohibition. In discussing this counterintuitive finding, we suggest that right-wing authoritarians are particularly vigilant toward norm violations-and this makes them more punitive toward counternormative expressions of prejudice, such as hate speech.	2.0
An integration of existing research and newly conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) connectivity analyses suggest a new framework for understanding the contribution of midline regions to social cognition. Recent meta-analyses suggest that there are no midline regions that are exclusively associated with self-processing. Whereas medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is broadly modulated by self-processing, subdivisions within MPFC are differentially modulated by the evaluation of close others (ventral MPFC: BA 10/32) and the evaluation of other social targets (dorsal MPFC: BA 9/32). The role of DMPFC in social cognition may also be less uniquely social than previously thought; it may be better characterized as a region that indexes certainty about evaluation rather than previously considered social mechanisms (i.e., correction of self-projection). VMPFC, a region often described as an important mediator of socioemotional significance, may instead perform a more cognitive role by reflecting the type of information brought to bear on evaluations of people we know well. Furthermore, the new framework moves beyond MPFC and hypothesizes that two other midline regions, ventral anterior cingulate cortex (VACC: BA 25) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC: BA 11), aid motivational influences on social cognition. Despite the central role of motivation in psychological models of self-perception, neural models have largely ignored the topic. Positive connectivity between VACC and MOFC may mediate bottom-up sensitivity to information based on its potential for helping us evaluate ourselves or others the way we want. As connectivity becomes more positive with striatum and less positive with middle frontal gyrus (BA 9/44), MOFC mediates top-down motivational influences by adjusting the standards we bring to bear on evaluations of ourselves and other people.	2.2
Infrastructure sustainability has become a major global concern. Massive reservoir siltations (RS) have seriously disrupted the service of many reservoirs worldwide. The dredged siltations are difficult to stockpile, or dispose of, because of their high water content and soft nature. This study explores a novel approach using RS to produce controlled low-strength materials (CLSM), reinforced with geobags that are used for storage and backfill applications. Test results have shown that, initially, geobags provided a significant contribution to the strength improvement of an RS-based CLSM. However, effective reinforcement appears to be highly dependent upon the type of geotextile and the original strength of the RS-CLSM. The results show a promising solution for reusing reservoir siltations and ensuring a sustainable approach for the mitigation of a silted reservoir.	4.1
The analysis of the penalized Stokes problem, in its variable viscosity formulation, coupled to convection-diffusion equations is presented in this article. It models the interaction between a highly viscous fluid with variable viscosity and immersed moving and deformable obstacles. Indeed, while it is quite common to couple Poisson equations to diffusion-transport equations in plasma physics or fluid dynamics in vorticity formulations, the study of complex fluids requires to consider together the Stokes problem in complex moving geometry and convection-diffusion equations. The main result of this paper shows the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to this equations system with regularity estimates. Then we show that the solution to the penalized problem weakly converges toward the solution to the physical problem. Numerical simulations of fluid mechanics computations in this context are also presented in order to illustrate the practical aspects of such models: lung cells and their surrounding heterogeneous fluid, and porous media flows. Among the main original aspects in the present study, one can highlight the non linear dynamics induced by the coupling, and the tracking of the time-dependence of the domain.	3.4
In the present study our major aim was to evaluate the up-to-date contamination status of the Topolnitsa reservoir. It is located in a region with intensive copper mining, which has been constantly contaminated with metals in the last few decades. Thus, we measured As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in surface water samples, as well as, in liver of.ommon carp in three different seasons spring, summer, and autumn 2013. Furthermore, we also studied the carp response to the water quality by observing its hepatic morphological structure and measuring some biochemical parameters (LDH, ALAT, and ASAT activity). In general, metal concentrations in the water varied, but As, Cu and Ni were present in all the three seasons. Cu concentrations were above the maximum permissible levels set by law. Metal concentrations in the liver were significantly higher than in the water (p<0.05). In addition, we observed severe hepatic histological alterations, which included degenerative changes - granular degeneration, vacuolar degeneration, hydropic degeneration, and fatty degeneration; necrotic changes (necrobiosis) karyopyknosis, karyorrexis and karyolysis, and necrosis; and changes in the blood vessels - hyperemia in sinusoids and major blood vessels. We found that LDH activity was inhibited in the common carp liver from the Topolnitsa reservoir compared to the reference fish, but ALAT and ASAT activity was significantly increased compared to the reference. Based on our findings we consider that the metal-contaminated waters of the Topolnitsa reservoir lead to negative changes at tissue and cellular level in the fish organism, which include altered structure and impaired functions of the liver.	4.4
Biofilms are ubiquitous in the pipes of drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs), and recent experimental studies revealed that the chlorination of the microbial carbon associated with the biofilm contributes to the total disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation with distinct mechanisms from those formed from precursors derived from natural organic matter (NOM). A multiple species reactive transport model was developed to explain the role of biofilms in DBPs formation by accounting for the simultaneous transport and interactions of disinfectants, organic compounds, and biomass. Using parameter values from experimental studies in the literature, the model equations were solved to predict chlorine decay and microbial regrowth dynamics in an actual DWDS, and trihalomethanes (THMs) formation in a pilot-scale distribution system simulator. The model's capability of reproducing the measured concentrations of free chlorine, suspended biomass, and THMs under different hydrodynamic and temperature conditions was demonstrated. The contribution of bacteria-derived precursors to the total THMs production was found to have a significant dependence on the system's hydraulics, seasonal variables, and the quality of the treated drinking water. Under system conditions that promoted fast bacterial re-growth, the transformation of non-microbial into microbial carbon DBP precursors by the biofilms showed a noticeable effect on the kinetics of THMs formation, especially when a high initial chlorine dose was applied. These conditions included elevated water temperature and high concentrations of nutrients in the influent water. The fraction of THMs formed from microbial sources was found to reach a peak of 12% of the total produced THMs under the investigated scenarios. The results demonstrated the importance of integrating bacterial regrowth dynamics in predictive DBPs formation models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.1
Background: mHealth (mobile health) services are becoming an increasingly important form of information and communication technology (ICT) enabled delivery for healthcare, especially in low-resource environments such as developing countries like Bangladesh. Despite widespread adoption of mobile phones and the acknowledged potential of using them to improve healthcare services, the adoption and acceptance of this technology among the elderly is significantly low. However, little research has been done to draw any systematic study of the elderly's intention to adopt mHealth services. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and then empirically test it for determining the key factors influencing elderly users' intention to adopt and use the mHealth services. Methods: A face-to-face structured questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from nearly 300 participants of age 60 years and above from the capital city of Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method, a statistical analysis technique based upon Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results: The study determined that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, technology anxiety, and resistance to change (p0.05). Conclusions: This study confirms the applicability of UTAUT model in the context of mHealth services among the elderly in developing countries like Bangladesh. It provides valuable information for mHealth service providers and policy makers in understanding the adoption challenges and the issues and also provides practical guidance for the successful implementation of mHealth services. Additionally the empirical findings identify implications related to the design and development of mHealth services that influence potential users. Furthermore, due to a generic approach, the findings of this study could be easily modified to assist other developing countries in the planning and up-take of mHealth services.

Background: Phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with labeled small-molecule tracer is a crucial non-invasive molecule imaging method of apoptosis. In this study, semi-automatic radiosynthesis and biodistribution of N-(2-F-18-fluoropropionyl)-bis(zinc(II)-dipicolylamine) (F-18-FP-DPAZn2), as a potential small-molecule tracer for PET imaging of cell death in Alzheimer's disease (AD) model, were performed. Methods: F-18-FP-DPAZn2 was synthesized on the modified PET-MF-2V-IT-I synthesizer. Biodistribution was determined in normal mice and PET images of AD model were obtained on a micro PET-CT scanner. Results: With the modified synthesizer, the total decay-corrected radiochemical yield of F-18-FP-DPAZn2 was 35 +/- 6% (n = 5) from F-18(-) within 105 +/- 10 min. Biodistribution results showed that kidney has the highest uptake of F-18-FP-DPAZn2. The uptake of radioactivity in brain kept at a relatively low level during the whole observed time. In vivo F-18-FP-DPAZn2 PET images demonstrated more accumulation of radioactivity in the brain of AD model mice than that in the brain of normal mice. Conclusions: The semi-automatic synthetic method provides a slightly higher radiochemical yield and shorter whole synthesis time of F-18-FP-DPAZn2 than the manual operation method. This improved method can give enough radioactivity and high radiochemical purity of F-18-FP-DPAZn2 for in vivo PET imaging. The results show that F-18-FP-DPAZn2 seems to be a potential cell death tracer for AD imaging.	5.2
Context switch is an essential feature of modern operating systems. The purpose of context switch is to provide concurrency processing of multiple programs. However, the backup and reload procedures due to context switch are time consuming. In this work, we propose a Racetrack-memory SRAM hybrid (RSH) cell design, which can be used to replace current SRAM cells in caches, to reduce the overhead of context switch. Using RSH reduces the overhead of context switch by 65.2% on average with 34% area overhead, compared with traditional SRAM designs.	0.4
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex brain disorder with an array of persistent behavioral and neurochemical manifestations. Both genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to the development of AUD, and recent studies on alcohol exposure and subsequent changes in gene expression suggest the importance of epigenetic mechanisms. In particular, histone modifications and DNA methylation have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and associated phenotypes of AUD. Given the therapeutic potential of epigenetic targets, this review aims to summarize the role of epigenetic regulation in our current understanding of AUD by evaluating known epigenetic signatures of brain regions critical to addictive behaviors in both animal and human studies throughout various stages of AUD. More specifically, the effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure, tolerance, and postexposure withdrawal on epigenetically induced changes to gene expression and synaptic plasticity within key brain regions and the associated behavioral phenotypes have been discussed. Understanding the contribution of epigenetic regulation to crucial signaling pathways may prove vital for future development of novel biomarkers and treatment agents in ameliorating or preventing AUD.	5.0
The majority of human neuroscience research has focussed on understanding functional organisation within segregated patches of cortex. The ventral visual stream has been associated with the detection of physical features such as faces and body parts, whereas the theory-of-mind network has been associated with making inferences about mental states and underlying character, such as whether someone is friendly, selfish, or generous. To date, however, it is largely unknown how such distinct processing components integrate neural signals. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and connectivity analyses, we investigated the contribution of functional integration to social perception. During scanning, participants observed bodies that had previously been associated with trait-based or neutral information. Additionally, we independently localised the body perception and theory-of-mind networks. We demonstrate that when observing someone who cues the recall of stored social knowledge compared to non-social knowledge, a node in the ventral visual stream (extrastriate body area) shows greater coupling with part of the theory-of-mind network (temporal pole). These results show that functional connections provide an interface between perceptual and inferential processing components, thus providing neurobiological evidence that supports the view that understanding the visual environment involves interplay between conceptual knowledge and perceptual processing.	2.1
Design and implementation of a low cost grid-connected 5kVA solar photovoltaic (PV) system is proposed in this paper. Since the inverter is a major component of the PV system, the B4 inverter used in this paper reduces the total cost of the PV system. In order to eliminate the massive transformer, the PV system is connected to the grid through IGBT switches. In addition to injection of active power into the grid, the B4 inverter can compensate reactive power and reduce harmonics of the nonlinear loads. A TMS320F28335 DSP processor is used for effective control of the B4 inverter. Various features of this processor enable the implementation of the necessary control algorithms. As a first step, the PV system is simulated and evaluated in Matlab/Simulink. In the second step, hardware circuits are designed and implemented based on the simulation results. The operation of the PV system has been evaluated under balanced, unbalanced, linear and nonlinear loads which proves its accuracy and efficiency.	1.4
Past research documents the extent that discrimination experiences and observations can undermine people's health and performance. In addition to discrimination's direct consequence for targets, discrimination implicates the morality of the larger community where it occurs. Perceptions of community morality could predict community identification that, in turn, could predict health and performance. To test this serial mediation hypothesis, 615 second- and third-year university undergraduates reported the frequency of discrimination observations and experiences. Students' perceptions of the university community's morality mediated the relationship between discrimination and the extent that they identified with the university. In turn, university identification mediated the relationship between university morality and students' academic engagement and mental health. However, only university morality reliably mediated the relationship between discrimination and physical health. Discrimination can affect the health and engagement of all community members, even observers who are not part of the targeted group.	2.0
Energy harvesting has become a promising and alternative solution to conventional energy generation patterns to overcome the problem of supplying autonomous electrical systems. More particularly, thermal energy harvesting technologies have drawn a major interest in both research and industry. Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs) can be used in two different operating conditions, under constant temperature gradient or constant heat flow. The commonly used TEG electrical model, based on a voltage source in series with an electrical resistance, shows its limitations especially under constant heat flow conditions. Here, the analytical electrical modeling, taking into consideration the internal and contact thermal resistances of a TEG under constant temperature gradient and constant heat flow conditions, is first given. To give further insight into the electrical behavior of a TEG module in different operating conditions, we propose a new and original way of emulating the above analytical expressions with usual electronics components (voltage source, resistors, diode), whose values are determined with the TEG's parameters. Note that such a TEG emulation is particularly suited when designing the electronic circuitry commonly associated to the TEG, to realize both Maximum Power Point Tracking and output voltage regulation. First, the proposed equivalent electrical circuits are validated through simulation with a SPICE environment in static operating conditions using only one value of either temperature gradient or heat flow. Then, they are also analyzed in dynamic operating conditions where both temperature gradient and heat flow are considered as time-varying functions.	1.2
Vast majority of practical engineering design problems require simultaneous handling of several criteria. For the sake of simplicity and through a priori preference articulation one can turn many design tasks into single-objective problems that can be handled using conventional numerical optimization routines. However, in some situations, acquiring comprehensive knowledge about the system at hand, in particular, about possible trade-offs between conflicting objectives may be necessary. This calls for multi objective optimization that aims at identifying a set of alternative, Pareto-optimal designs. The most popular solution approaches include population-based metaheuristics. Unfortunately, such methods are not practical for problems involving expensive computational models. This is particularly the case for microwave and antenna engineering where design reliability requires utilization of CPU-intensive electromagnetic (EM) analysis. In this work, we discuss methodologies for expedited multi-objective design optimization of expensive EM simulation models. The solution approaches that we present here rely on surrogate-based optimization (SBO) paradigm, where the design speedup is obtained by shifting the optimization burden into a cheap replacement model (the surrogate). The latter is utilized for generating the initial approximation of the Pareto front representation as well as further front refinement (to elevate it to the high-fidelity EM simulation model level). We demonstrate several application case studies, including a wideband matching transformer, a dielectric resonator antenna and an ultra-wideband monopole antenna. Dimensionality of the design spaces in the considered examples vary from six to fifteen, and the design optimization cost is about one hundred of high-fidelity EM simulations of the respective structure, which is extremely low given the problem complexity.

The object of this paper is to outline the interactive teaching model developed by the education innovation group 'New Teaching Methodologies in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Technology of the Polytechnic University of Madrid. The aim of the model is to teach the subject of Manufacturing Engineering Technology for the Mechanical Technical Engineering degree course. It is based on a new face-to-face methodology that we have called DE-learning (driven electronic learning) in which theoretical teaching and laboratory teaching are combined in a collaborative environment, managed through the developed software that combines: theroretical lessons, solved practical examples, exercises, bibliographical references, Webpage links and self-assessment tests. [Here the term 'collaborative' is used to describe the teaching methodology whereby student-to-student and student-to-teacher relationship.] The teaching of this new model is 'driven' under the guidance and supervision of a professor, in an educational environment with no formally taught classes. Students themselves can decide on the pace at which they learn the resources used, the definition and carrying out of practical exercises and whether they wish to form collaborations among themselves during study time. The fundamental advantage of this model is its efficiency in optimising learning time, given that: (a) all the necessary resources are accessible to the student through electronic teaching support, (b) the laboratory practical classes take place in the same environment, as they are combined and connected to the theoretical concepts without any break incontinuity, and (c) students' problems can be resolved in a personal and immediate way by the professor. In addition to this, other advantages have emerged that are equally relevant in the engineering training of the students: the development of better communication skills as well as their skills and abilities, motivation, creativity and increase in confidence and confidence in their decisions. The efficacy of this new teaching model has ben confirmed through the academic results attained by the students during the 2006/07 academic year, which are presented in this paper.	3.2
Hormonal responses to acute stress rely on the rapid induction of corticotropinreleasing hormone (CRH) production in the mammalian hypothalamus, with subsequent instructive steps culminating in corticosterone release at the periphery. Hypothalamic CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are therefore considered as 'stress neurons'. However, significant morphological and functional diversity among neurons that can transiently produce CRH in other hypothalamic nuclei has been proposed, particularly as histochemical and molecular biology evidence associates CRH to both GABA and glutamate neurotransmission. Here, we review recent advances through single-cell RNA sequencing and circuit mapping to suggest that CRH production reflects a state switch in hypothalamic neurons and thus confers functional competence rather than being an identity mark of phenotypically segregated neurons. We show that CRH mRNA transcripts can therefore be seen in GABAergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal contingents in the hypothalamus. We then distinguish 'stress neurons' of the paraventricular nucleus that constitutively express secretagogin, a Ca2+ sensor critical for the stimulus-driven assembly of the molecular machinery underpinning the fast regulated exocytosis of CRH at the median eminence. Cumulatively, we infer that CRH neurons are functionally and molecularly more diverse than previously thought.	6.0
The 3-stage model of social inference posits that people categorize behaviors and characterize actors or situations effortlessly, but they correct these characterizations with additional information effortfully. The current article tests this model using developmental data, assuming that the less cognitively demanding processes in the model (i.e., categorization, characterization) should appear earlier in development, whereas the more demanding correction process should not appear until later in development. Using 2 different paradigms, Studies 1 and 3 found that younger children failed to take situational information into account while characterizing the actor. Study 2 found that younger children failed to take dispositional information into account while characterizing the situation. In contrast, in these 3 studies, older children used the available information to correct their characterizations of the actors and of the situations. Consistent with the 3-stage model, during elementary school years, children start to integrate additional information when drawing explicit social inferences. In Study 4, children of all age levels used a prior expectancy to draw a dispositional inference, ignoring situational information, suggesting that characterizations based on prior expectancies about an actor are a highly efficient process, not contemplated by the model. The 4 studies together illustrate how developmental data can be valuably used to test adult socio-cognitive models, to extend their validity, or to simply further inform those models.	2.2
In2S3 films have been grown on preheated glass substrate by spray pyrolysis. Indium chloride and thiourea in the molar ratio S:In = 2 were used as reagents. Substrate temperature was fixed at 613 K. These films adhered well to the substrate and were approximately 2 mu m thick. Structural, morphological, optical, and electrical properties of the as-grown In2S3 films were studied by use of x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical absorption spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. XRD revealed well crystallized films oriented in the (400) direction corresponding to the cubic beta-In2S3 phase. The surface of the films was smooth; average roughness was 5 nm. The AFM image revealed that the films were nanopolycrystalline and contained grains in the range 20-30 nm. Optical transmission in the visible and near-infrared regions was 80%. The direct band-gap energy was 2.62 eV. The electrical data were analyzed on the basis of the impedance Cole-Cole plots in the frequency range 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz at room temperature. Constant-phase elements were used in equivalent electrical circuits for fitting of experimental impedance data. The experimental results were fitted to the equivalent electrical circuit by use of Z-view software. The conductivity of grains and grain boundaries was estimated. The gas-sensing properties of the sample were investigated on the basis of the change in conductance as a result of adsorption and desorption of atmospheric oxygen.	1.2
One way to study ecological implications induced by hydropeaking represents the coupling of hydrodynamic models with habitat suitability models, in which hydrodynamic parameters are typically used to describe the physical habitat of indicator species. This article discusses the differences in habitat suitability assessment between 2D and 3D CFD modelling as input for the habitat simulation tool CASiMiR. In the first part of the article, the accuracy of the hydraulic model is evaluated by comparing the model results with laboratory (model of a laboratory channel with erodible bed) and field measurements (Valsura River, Bolzano, Italy). In the second part, the habitat suitability for the Valsura River case study (affected by hydropeaking), is analyzed comparing different approaches for the reconstruction of the velocity field (depth-averaged velocities from 2D modelling, bottom velocity field reconstruction with log-law approach from 2D modelling and bottom velocity field from 3D modelling). The results show that the habitat suitability index (HSI) using 2D or 3D hydrodynamic models can be significantly different. These differences can be ascribed to a higher capability to depict the features of the flow field with highly variable and heterogeneous boundary conditions and to the possibility to simulate the near bed hydrodynamic parameters, which are relevant for certain target species. In particular, the HSI-values using 3D hydraulics lead to larger areas of highly suitable habitats compared to 2D simulations. Moreover, considering the entire flow range of hydropeaking events, the habitat simulations with bottom flow velocities from 3D modelling provide suitable habitats over the entire flow range representing the availability of stable suitable habitats, while the habitat availability of 2D modelled flow velocity is continuously decreasing with increasing flow rates.

A next generation B factory and the detector counterpart, SuperKEKB and Belle II, are being built in Japan, as the upgrades of KEKB and Belle, respectively. The new collider will start its commissioning in 2015. This is an ambitious project. The luminosity of the e(+) e(-) collider will be upgraded by a factor of 40, which will create a 50 times larger data set compared to the Belle sample. Both the background and the triggered event rates will be increased by a factor of at least 10. The Belle II software system is designed to accommodate these challenges and to run on grid, cloud, and local resources around the world. Various external software packages are employed to enhance the user interface. The software system, basf2, is structured as a framework built with dynamic module loading and the ability of parallel processing. The system is written in C++ with Python steering scripts, compatible with common Linux operating systems. A full detector simulation library is created based on Geant4. In this paper, we will explain the design of the Belle II software structure and the current status of the software development.	0.4
An essential step to wide-scale dissemination is to investigate moderators of intervention effectiveness. This study examined moderators of the effects of a universal school-based mindfulness program on adolescents' depressive symptoms. Based on theory and previous research, we identified the following potential moderators: (1) severity of symptoms of depression at baseline, (2) gender, (3) age, and (4) school track. The study uses a pooled dataset from two consecutive randomized controlled trials in adolescents (13-18 years) in secondary schools in Belgium. Results on effectiveness based on the first trial were published in this journal (Raes et al. 2014). A second consecutive trial was conducted to obtain a more equal distribution between school tracks and to enlarge power, yielding a total of 605 students from nine schools. In each school, parallel classes were randomized to the mindfulness condition or usual curriculum control condition. Data were collected 1 week before and 1 week after delivery of the training and at 6-month follow-up. Moderation was tested longitudinally with multilevel models across the three repeated measures and across condition. We found no moderation effects of gender, age, and school track. Six months after the training, we found a marginally significant moderation effect for severity of symptoms of depression at baseline with greater decrease in symptoms for students with high levels of depression. The general absence of differential intervention effects for gender, age, and school track supports the broad scope of the school-based mindfulness group intervention.	5.4
Many identity-based proxy signature (IBPS) schemes have been proposed, but most were proved to be secure using a random oracle model, which has attracted considerable criticism. Cao and Cao proposed an IBPS scheme using the standard model, but their scheme was shown to be insecure because it could not resist a delegator attack. In order to overcome this weakness, Gu et al. proposed a new IBPS scheme in 2013 that uses the standard model and they also provided a detailed security model for IBPS. However, in this study, we demonstrate that Gu et al.'s scheme is still vulnerable to delegator attack. In order to correct this problem, we propose an improvement of the IBPS scheme described by Gu et al. We also present an efficiency analysis for our scheme and a detailed security proof based on the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.	0.3
There is evidence that differences among individuals in white matter microstructure, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are under genetic control. However, little is known about the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects on different diffusivity indices among late middle-aged adults. Here, we examined the magnitude of genetic influences for fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean (MD), axial (AD), and radial (RD) diffusivities in male twins aged 56-66 years old. Using an atlas-based registration approach to delineate individual white matter tracts, we investigated mean DTI-based indices within the corpus callosum, 12 bilateral tracts and all these regions of interest combined. All four diffusivity indices had high heritability at the global level (72%-80%). The magnitude of genetic effects in individual tracts varied from 0% to 82% for FA, 0% to 81% for MD, 8% to 77% for AD, and 0% to 80% for RD with most of the tracts showing significant heritability estimates. Despite the narrow age range of this community-based sample, age was correlated with all four diffusivity indices at the global level. In sum, all diffusion indices proved to have substantial heritability for most of the tracts and the heritability estimates were similar in magnitude for different diffusivity measures. Future studies could aim to discover the particular set of genes that underlie the significant heritability of white matter microstructure. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	6.4
This paper accepts the widespread view that as electricity generation systems transition towards a greater proportion of renewables provision, there will be an increasing need for storage facilities. However, it differs from most such studies in contrasting the private incentives of a storage operator with the public desirability of bulk storage. A key factor in the context of a market such as Britain, where renewable energy largely means wind generation, is the nature of wind generation itself. The problem of wind's high variance and intermittent nature is explored. It is argued that not only is there a missing money and a missing market issue in providing secure energy supplies, there is also a missing informational issue. A key opportunity for new storage is participation in a capacity market, if the setting is right.	1.0
Phospholipid flippases are key regulators of transbilayer lipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cell membranes, critical to many trafficking and signaling pathways. P4-ATPases, in particular, are responsible for the uphill transport of phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane, as well as membranes of the late secretory/endocytic pathways, thereby establishing transbilayer asymmetry. Recent studies combining cell biology and biochemical approaches have improved our understanding of the path taken by lipids through P4-ATPases. Additionally, identification of several protein families catalyzing phospholipid 'scrambling', i.e. disruption of phospholipid asymmetry through energy-independent bi-directional phospholipid transport, as well as the recent report of the structure of such a scramblase, opens the way to a deeper characterization of their mechanism of action. Here, we discuss the molecular nature of the mechanism by which lipids may 'flip' across membranes, with an emphasis on active lipid transport catalyzed by P4-ATPases.

This paper presents an improved phase leg power loop design for enhance mode lateral structure Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors. Static characterization results of a 650V/30A GaN transistor are presented to determine the design parameters of the gate driver circuits. The control of Common Mode (CM) noise current propagation is considered during the gate driver design by optimizing the power distribution and grounding structure of the gate driver and digital control circuits. By differentiating the propagation path impedance of digital control circuits and their power supply circuits, conductive CM noise can propagate through power supply path to protect the digital control circuits. In order to reduce current commutation loop inductance within the GaN phase leg, an improved power loop design with vertical structure is proposed for lateral structure GaN transistors which can significantly reduce power loop inductance compared with conventional lateral power loop design. The design is verified through experiments on a phase leg prototype which prove the performance of the proposed phase leg on the overvoltage reduction during current transition along with less cross-coupling between power loop and gate loop compared with conventional lateral power loop design. A full bridge voltage source inverter is implemented with the designed phase leg and tested with EMI noise measurement that verifies the effectiveness of the CM propagation path control.	1.4
The insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of islet cell biology. However, the signaling pathway(s) utilized by insulin to directly modulate -cells is unclear. To interrogate whether insulin exerts endocrine effects in regulating proteins in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling cascade in vivo in physiological states via the insulin receptor, we designed two experimental approaches: 1) glucose gavage and 2) hyperinsulinemic intravenous infusion, for studies in either -cell specific insulin receptor knock-out (IRKO) or control mice. Immunostaining of sections of pancreas (collected immediately after glucose gavage or insulin infusion) from controls showed significant increases in pAKT+, p-p70S6K+, and pERK+ -cells and a significant decrease in % nuclear FoxO1+ -cells compared with corresponding vehicle-treated groups. In contrast, in IRKOs, we observed no significant changes in pAKT+ or p-p70S6K+ -cells in either experiment; however, pERK+ -cells were significantly increased, and an attenuated decrease in % nuclear FoxO1+ cells was evident in response to glucose gavage or insulin infusion. Treatment of control and IRKO -cell lines with glucose or insulin showed significantly decreased % nuclear FoxO1+ -cells suggesting direct effects. Furthermore, blocking MAPK signaling had virtually no effect on FoxO1 nuclear export in controls, in contrast to attenuated export in IRKO -cells. These data suggest insulin acts on -cells in an endocrine manner in the normal situation; and that in -cells lacking insulin receptors, insulin and glucose minimally activate the Akt pathway, while ERK phosphorylation and FoxO1 nuclear export occur independently of insulin signaling.	6.1
Recent rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and the necessity to comply with environmental standards suggest the need for studies on the possible negative effects of this type of industry. One of the most devastating effects of aquaculture is water pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent from fish farms into aquatic ecosystems. Assessment of the pollutants requires an optimal design of a water monitoring network in a way to demonstrate changes in aquatic environments. Accordingly, the present study used multivariate statistical analysis to determine sampling frequency for optimal monitoring of the contaminants resulting from trout farms in the Haraz River in northern Iran. For this purpose, a total number of 17 physical and chemical water quality parameters were sampled monthly over a one-year period based on the instructions recommended in the standard method (2005) [1]. The results showed that changes in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during the warm months of summer were very high and reached its peak in August and September. This may be attributed to the increased fish production in fish farms, increased food intake to feed the fish, and higher rate of discharge from fish farms containing waste feed and fish faeces. The nitrate also reached its maximum level in June due to the same reasons. Conversely, dissolved oxygen (DO) level was the lowest in the warm months (August and September). The reason would be increased consumption of DO due to higher production rate in the fish farms and increased metabolism of fish in warm months. Overall, the findings confirmed the applicability of multivariate techniques in determining temporal frequency of the measurements during the monitoring period. By which it would be possible to recognize the reality of changes in water quality, with fewer measurements, and in less time and cost.	4.4
Silicon nanopore membranes (SNMs) with compact geometry and uniform pore size distribution have demonstrated a remarkable capacity for hemofiltration. These advantages could potentially be used for hemodialysis. Here, we present an initial evaluation of the SNM's mechanical robustness, diffusive clearance, and hemocompatibility in a parallel plate configuration. Mechanical robustness of the SNM was demonstrated by exposing membranes to high flows (200 ml/min) and pressures (1,448 mm Hg). Diffusive clearance was performed in an albumin solution and whole blood with blood and dialysate flow rates of 25 ml/min. Hemocompatibility was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry after 4 hours in an extracorporeal porcine model. The pressure drop across the flow cell was 4.6 mm Hg at 200 ml/min. Mechanical testing showed that SNM could withstand up to 775.7 mm Hg without fracture. Urea clearance did not show an appreciable decline in blood versus albumin solution. Extracorporeal studies showed blood was successfully driven via the arterial-venous pressure differential without thrombus formation. Bare silicon showed increased cell adhesion with a 4.1-fold increase and 1.8-fold increase over polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated surfaces for tissue plasminogen factor (t-PA) and platelet adhesion (CD41), respectively. These initial results warrant further design and development of a fully scaled SNM-based parallel plate dialyzer for renal replacement therapy.	3.4
This research introduces a novel magnetically isolated phase structure for switched reluctance motor, namely, as Septi-Segment SRM (SSSRM), which is proper for high torque/volume and with lowest leakage flux in different fields of industries. The SSSRM contains seven stator layers that are isolated from each other magnetically, also each of them include an assembly of 4/4 stator/rotor poles. The three layers are energized at the same time for generating higher torque with lower ripple compared with the typical SRM. Furthermore, this configuration results other advantages, such as easy cooling and independent phases. To evaluate the proposed motor performance, the configuration is introduced at first. Secondly, the motor profiles as flux linkage, flux density, self/mutual inductance and motor torque are assessed using a 3D finite element method (3D-FEM). An SSSRM has been manufactured with a test bench in the laboratory, and the experimental results of the new motor and typical type were compared in the same volume and area. The results and comparative study clearly demonstrate the prominent features of the proposed motor for various applications. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	3.3
We propose a new (n,n) multi-secret images sharing scheme that provides high level of provable security with fast sharing and reconstruction procedures. It uses simple Boolean operations conjointly with a secure stream cipher and a cryptographic hash function in order to enable an efficient sharing of n secret images among a set of n different participants. This approach overcomes the security weakness detected in existing similar schemes, and provides additional advantages such as high sensitivity to alterations and ability to share heterogeneous images having diverse resolutions. Obtained experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of the method compared to existing schemes, particularly its ability to ensure higher security level with competitive computational performances.	0.3
Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently report poor psychological well-being. Previous research has supported mindfulness-based interventions to enhance psychological well-being in parents of children with ASD, but studies about this topic are still rare. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of brief mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on perceived stress, anxiety, and depression among parents of children with ASD in Jordan. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with a comparison group was used. A sample of 104 parents of children with ASD has completed the study. Parents were matched on measures of age, gender, and level of severity of ASD in their children based on DSM-V criteria and randomized to one of the two groups. The intervention group participated in 5-week mindfulness-based intervention program, while participants in the comparison group had not attended the program between pretest and posttest measures. Participants in both groups had poor psychological well-being before the intervention program. After the intervention program, the one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that parents in the intervention group had better outcomes on the measures of psychological well-being and mindfulness than those in the comparison group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, results of paired samples t test indicated that parents in the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in measures of stress, anxiety, depression, and mindfulness scores with medium to large effect size (Cohen d between 0.42 and 0.85, P < 0.01). Although the comparison group demonstrated small improvement in measures of the dependent variables, these improvements were much less than improvements in the intervention group. The MBIs are culturally adaptable, feasible, and effective interventions to improve psychological well-being in parents of children with ASD.	5.4
Intracellular pathogens survive and replicate within specialised membrane-bound compartments that can be considered as pseudo-organelles. Using the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia as an illustrative example, we consider the modes of lipid transport between pathogen-containing compartments and host organelles, including the formation of static membrane contact sites. We discuss how lipid scavenging can be mediated via the reprogramming of cellular transporters at these interfaces and describe recent data suggesting that pathogen effectors modulate the formation of specific membrane contacts. Further study of these emerging mechanisms is likely to yield new insights into the cell biology of lipid transport and organelle communication, which highlights potential new targets and strategies for future therapeutics.

Gravure printing is one of the most promising technologies for high volume production of printed electronics and microscale films and devices. The characteristics of the printed pattern, i.e. ink volume, resolution and pattern placement (registration), are directly related to the fluid mechanics of the liquid transfer process from a cell to a substrate wrapped around a rotating roll; the liquid transfer is mainly controlled by free surfaces and dynamic contact lines. Most of the available analyses are restricted to axisymmetric flows, at which the relative motion between the cavity and the substrate is greatly simplified. Recent results have shown that the use of the complete description of the relative motion in a roll-to-roll process is critical to obtain accurate results on the amount of liquid that is transferred to the substrate. In this work we present an extension of the model describing liquid transfer from a groove to a substrate in a R2R process in order to consider the liquid transfer from a small individual cell; to this end we solve a full 3D free surface flow with moving contact lines. The results show that the liquid transfer dynamics is governed by two different characteristic time scales, one is associated with the contact line motion and the other with liquid filament breakup. Both are dependent on the capillary number. The predictions show how the volume, registration and shape of the printed dot varies with operating conditions and liquid properties. These predictions could be helpful in designing high precision printing operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.4
This paper demonstrates how to interact with a conversational agent that speaks through an actual human body face-to-face and in person (i.e., offscreen). This is made possible by the cyranoid method: a technique involving a human person speech shadowing for a remote third-party (i.e., receiving their words via a covert audio-relay apparatus and repeating them aloud in real-time). When a person shadows for an artificial conversational agent source, we call the resulting hybrid an echoborg. We report a study in which people encountered conversational agents either through a human shadower face-to-face or via a text interface under conditions where they assumed their interlocutor to be an actual person. Our results show that the perception of a conversational agent is dramatically altered when the agent is voiced by an actual, tangible person. We discuss the potential implications this methodology has for the development of conversational agents and general person perception research.	2.2
As the demand for textile products and synthetic dyes increases with the growing global population, textile dye wastewater is becoming one of the most significant water pollution contributors. Azo dyes represent 70% of dyes used worldwide, and are hence a significant contributor to textile waste. In this work, the removal of a reactive azo dye (Reactive Orange 16) from water by adsorption with chitosan grafted poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (CTS-GMA-g-PPEGMA) was investigated. The chitosan (CTS) was first functionalized with glycidyl methacrylate and then grafted with poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) using a nitroxide-mediated polymerization grafting to approach. Equilibrium adsorption experiments were carried out at different initial dye concentrations and were successfully fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. Adsorption isotherms showed maximum adsorption capacities of CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA and chitosan of 200 mg/g and 150 mg/g, respectively, while the Langmuir equations estimated 232 mg/g and 194 mg/g, respectively. The fundamental assumptions underlying the Langmuir model may not be applicable for azo dye adsorption, which could explain the difference. The Freundlich isotherm parameters, n and K, were determined to be 2.18 and 17.7 for CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA and 0.14 and 2.11 for chitosan, respectively. An n value between one and ten generally indicates favorable adsorption. The adsorption capacities of a chitosan-PPEGMA 50/50 physical mixture and pure PPEGMA were also investigated, and both exhibited significantly lower adsorption capacities than pure chitosan. In this work, CTS-g-GMA-PPEGMA proved to be more effective than its parent chitosan, with a 33% increase in adsorption capacity.	4.4
Lateral segregation of plasma membrane lipids is a generally accepted phenomenon. Lateral lipid microdomains of specific composition, structure and biological functions are established as a result of simultaneous action of several competing mechanisms which contribute to membrane organization. Various lines of evidence support the conclusion that among those mechanisms, the membrane potential plays significant and to some extent unique role. Above all, clear differences in the microdomain structure as revealed by fluorescence microscopy could be recognized between polarized and depolarized membranes. In addition, recent fluorescence spectroscopy experiments reported depolarization-induced changes in a membrane lipid order. In the context of earlier findings showing that plasma membranes of depolarized cells are less susceptible to detergents and the cells less sensitive to antibiotics or antimycotics treatment we discuss a model, in which membrane potential driven re-organization of the microdomain structure contributes to maintaining membrane integrity during response to stress, pathogen attack and other challenges involving partial depolarization of the plasma membrane.

Rainwater harvesting can provide an alternative water source, which may demand little treatment, depending on the end use. Some starches have been used in water treatment as coagulant/flocculant/filtration aid, and might be applied as primary coagulant. Here, we show direct filtration with hydraulic rapid mixing, using 2-6 mg L-1 cationic corn starch as primary coagulant, considerably improves roof-harvested rainwater quality, achieving removal efficiencies of up to 71.7% of apparent colour, 78% of turbidity, 1.1 log-unit of total coliform, and 1.6 log-unit of Escherichia coli, meeting guidelines for turbidity, even for potable purposes. Cationic corn starch has proved to be a suitable primary coagulant when filtration is performed in a single-layer sand filter (coefficient of uniformity: 1.8, effective particle size: 0.52 mm), at hydraulic loading rate of 450 m day(-1). However, a disinfection unit is required to meet an absence of faecal coliform.	4.3
The gut microbiome contributes approximately 2 kg of the whole body weight, and recent studies suggest that gut microbiota has a profound effect on human metabolism, potentially contributing to several features of the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is defined by a clustering of metabolic disorders that include central adiposity with visceral fat accumulation, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, dysglycemia and non-optimal blood pressure levels. Metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. It is estimated that around 20-25 percent of the world's adult population has metabolic syndrome. In this manuscript, we have reviewed the existing data linking gut microbiome with metabolic syndrome. Existing evidence from studies both in animals and humans support a link between gut microbiome and various components of metabolic syndrome. Possible pathways include involvement with energy homeostasis and metabolic processes, modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways, interferences with the immune system, and interference with the renin-angiotensin system. Modification of gut microbiota via prebiotics, probiotics or other dietary interventions has provided evidence to support a possible beneficial effect of interventions targeting gut microbiota modulation to treat components or complications of metabolic syndrome.

Results of large-eddy simulations of stably stratified atmospheric flow around an isolated, complex-shaped tall building are presented. The study focuses on the identification of flow structures in the building wake in high and low Froude number regimes. A qualitative comparison of results with available literature data and existing theories is presented. In addition to flow structures identified in earlier studies such as the horseshoe and recirculation eddy vortices, we analyze a stationary disturbance akin to mountain gravity wave, and a complex vortex structure associated with this wave, consisting of multiple symmetric pairs of vortices. The Froude number appears to be the principal parameter controlling the structure of the wake, waves and vortex pattern.	3.4
Detecting where our partners direct their gaze is an important aspect of social interaction. An atypical gaze processing has been reported in autism. However, it remains controversial whether children and adults with autism spectrum disorder interpret indirect gaze direction with typical accuracy. This study investigated whether the detection of gaze direction toward an object is less accurate in autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (n=33) and intelligence quotients-matched and age-matched controls (n=38) were asked to watch a series of synthetic faces looking at objects, and decide which of two objects was looked at. The angle formed by the two possible targets and the face varied following an adaptive procedure, in order to determine individual thresholds. We found that gaze direction detection was less accurate in autism spectrum disorder than in control participants. Our results suggest that the precision of gaze following may be one of the altered processes underlying social interaction difficulties in autism spectrum disorder.	2.1
Warp-knitted brushed fabrics are special pile fabrics with uneven and declining piles that consist of broken filament ends. It is difficult to predict the finial pattern of the pile surface in the process of the design of patterned fabric. There are few researches on computer simulation of the fabric because of their complicated and fuzzy characteristic. This paper focuses on computer simulation of this group of pile fabrics. Firstly, the characteristics of warp-knitted brushed fabric and the factors that influence the pile are discussed. Secondly, a simplified line model is proposed to represent the shape of the pile by some lines in a certain titling angle, radial angle and length. A two-dimensional matrix is used to describe the position and color of piles in one pattern repeat. Finally, based on the mathematic model, a program is developed by VC++.NET to realize the simulation of the brushed fabric with a patterned pile. By the input of some parameters that were adjusted according to the craft, the two-dimensional computer simulation of the pile surface was found to be similar to the actual patterned pile fabric. It is proved that the method is feasible and contributes to the development of a computer-aided design system to realize the design and simulation of the warp-knitted brushed fabric.	3.0
With the help of new design tools, manufacturing-integrated solutions can be generated that concurrently consider function and process. Based on the design pattern matrix, solution elements can be developed that realize the product function by systematically utilizing manufacturing-induced properties. The developed manufacturing-integrated product solutions are refined using computer-aided methods (feature-based modeling and information modeling). A product embodiment is generated that is specifically tailored to the chosen manufacturing technology. An integrated information model allows the introduced tools to be used throughout the entire development process. The example of a linear flow split snap-fit fastening illustrates how the tools beneficially interact and realize manufacturing potential, resulting in an innovative product design.	3.0
This article introduces user experience research that has been carried out by evaluating a video-illustrated science fiction prototype with process control workers. Essentially, the prototype 'A remote operator's day in a future control center in 2025' was aimed at discovering opportunities for new interaction methods and ambient intelligence for the factories of the future. The theoretical objective was to carry out experience design research, which was based on explicit ambient user experience goals in the nominated industrial work context. This article describes the complete creative prototyping process, starting from the initial user research that included evaluations of current work practices, technological trend studies and co-design workshops, and concluding with user research that assessed the final design outcome, the science fiction prototype. The main contribution of the article is on the ambient user experience goals, the creation process of the video-illustrated science fiction prototype, and on the reflection of how the experience-driven prototype was evaluated in two research setups: as video sequences embedded in a Web survey, and as interviews carried out with expert process control workers. For the science fiction prototyping process, the contribution demonstrates how the method may employ video-illustration as a means for future-oriented user experience research, and how complementary user-centered methods may be used to validate the results.	4.0
Melanins are darkpolymers found in the cell wall of pathogenic fungi, including species from the genus Sporothrix that are causative agents of sporotrichosis. In vitro experiments strongly suggest that these pigments are important for fungal virulence and survival in the host. In S. schenckii, melanin biosynthesis occurs via three different common pathways, which generate dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin, DOPA-melanin or pyomelanin. Moreover, melanin biosynthesis can be enhanced when the fungus is in contact with some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Melanin pigments have protective effects against antifungals in this genus. New scanning transmission electron tomography data indicates the accumulation of dark pigments in membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles (melanosomes) in S. schenckii yeasts. Here, we provide an up to date of review the biosynthesis and role of melanins and discuss its roles on the cell biology and pathogenesis of Sporothrix spp. (C) 2016 British Mycological Society.

Ambient intelligence is a suitable paradigm for developing daily life solutions including the health care domain. Many ageing adults who decide to live alone at home need constant monitoring to control their health status and quality of life. This paper introduces the description of a wearable device capable of acquiring the electrodermal activity (EDA) in order to obtain information on the arousal level of the elderly. The lightweight wearable device is placed in the wrist of the ageing adult to allow continuous monitoring of EDA signals. With the aim of triggering changes in the emotional state of the ageing adult, fifty pictures from the International Affective Picture System are used to assess the electronic device through a series of experiments. The initial results show that the overall system classifies people into two classes: calmed and stressed patients. The results show that through measuring the EDA events' magnitudes, the ageing adults' arousal level is classified with a global accuracy higher than 80 %.	4.0
Social pain is often associated with social rejection and shares neural correlates with the bothersome aspect of physical pain, which may also indicate an overlap in function. Pain has been described as a motivational signal to respond to the source of the pain in an adaptive way, such as by altering behavior. We tested whether social pain causes similarly adaptive alterations in behavior. Participants played computerized ball-tossing tasks with putative players-one who passed to and one who excluded the participant from play-in both a social and nonsocial version. We assessed the behavioral consequences of social pain by comparing the number of throws to each stimulus (social rejector vs. nonsocial rejector) over the course of the task. Posttask questionnaires assessed subjective feelings of social pain. A decrease in throws to the rejecting stimulus was only observed in the social version, indicating that rejection that is social in nature leads to change in behavior. Moreover, participants reported more negative feelings toward the rejecting stimulus in the social than in the nonsocial version. These subjective feelings of social pain mediated the effect of version of the game (social vs. nonsocial) on changes in behavior, indicating that social pain from social rejection causes changes in behavior.	2.1
A common feature of ambient intelligence is that many objects are inter-connected and act in unison, which is also a challenge in the Internet of Things. There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application.	4.0
Fault detection in induction machines is commonly realized through motor current signature analysis. In case of Wound-Rotor Induction Machine rotor faults, the amplitude of the inverse sequence harmonic component -sf of the rotor current space-vector is monitored in order to sense its variation. However, motor current signature analysis is limited by some drawbacks. In fact, under transient operating conditions an efficient Fast Fourier Transform cannot be made, since slip or frequency vary, and so the amplitude of the harmonic component -sf. In this paper, a new technique based on the Square Current Space-vector Signature Analysis (SCSSA) is proposed for rotor fault detection in Wound-Rotor Induction Machines operating under time-varying conditions. The performance of the proposed approach is confirmed by simulation and experimental results. The proposed technique can be easily embedded in the digital control system for modern wind power plants.	1.4
Existing mountain permafrost distribution models generally offer a good overview of the potential extent of this phenomenon at a regional scale. They are however not always able to reproduce the high spatial discontinuity of permafrost at the micro-scale (scale of a specific landform; ten to several hundreds of meters). To overcome this lack, we tested an alternative modelling approach using three classification algorithms belonging to statistics and machine learning: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines and Random forests. These supervised learning techniques infer a classification function from labelled training data (pixels of permafrost absence and presence) with the aim of predicting the permafrost occurrence where it is unknown. The research was carried out in a 588 km(2) area of the Western Swiss Alps. Permafrost evidences were mapped from ortho-image interpretation (rock glacier inventorying) and field data (mainly geoelectrical and thermal data). The relationship between selected permafrost evidences and permafrost controlling factors was computed with the mentioned techniques. Classification performances, assessed with AUROC, range between 0.81 for Logistic regression, 0.85 with Support Vector Machines and 0.88 with Random forests. The adopted machine learning algorithms have demonstrated to be efficient for permafrost distribution modelling thanks to consistent results compared to the field reality. The high resolution of the input dataset (10 m) allows elaborating maps at the micro-scale with a modelled permafrost spatial distribution less optimistic than classic spatial models. Moreover, the probability output of adopted algorithms offers a more precise overview of the potential distribution of mountain permafrost than proposing simple indexes of the permafrost favorability. These encouraging results also open the way to new possibilities of permafrost data analysis and mapping. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
Due to their efficiency, revitalized traditional techniques for irrigation management of scarce water resources have been suggested as a way to at least partially cope with the present water crises in the Middle East. A better irrigation management includes re-using treated wastewater in agriculture. Treated wastewater should also be used in industrial processes, thus contributing to a more efficient overall water management. However, the most important change leading to better water management is improving water efficiency in agricultural irrigation. Traditional water management techniques have an important role in many Middle East and North African (MENA) countries. Besides bringing more water to a thirsty population, they can also contribute to the societal awareness, and recognition of the great diversity of cultural and social values water has to human civilization.	4.3
The U.S. is reported to have one of the most developed green building markets. The country wide success must start from the success of different local markets. So how many important local green building markets are there in the U.S. and why those areas became important? The answers can provide useful implications for developing countries like China to better promote their green building markets. To explore the question in a numerical way, this study therefore collected the data of 17,636 green building projects in the U.S., clustered them into 39 important regions, and analyzed the numerical patterns behind based on 82 different features covering demography, economy, education, climate and policy. Non-linear machine learning algorithms help find that economic factors and educational factors are one of the most influential features. Discoveries were also implemented in China to suggest 20 areas to be the focus of developing Chinese green building market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	0.1
River pollution is one of the most challenging environmental issues, but the effect of river pollution levels on the biofilm communities has not been well-studied. Spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of environmental parameters and the biofilm communities were investigated in the Qinhuai River basin, Nanjing, China. Water samples were grouped into three clusters reflecting their varying pollution levels of relatively slight pollution, moderated pollution, and high pollution by hierarchical cluster analysis. In different clusters, the biofilm communities mainly differed in the proportion of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. As the dominant classes of Proteobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-and Gammaproteobacteria seemed to show an upward trend followed by a small fluctuation in the abundance with the escalation of water pollution level. Results of redundancy analysis demonstrated that temperature, total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios (TN/TP) and concentrations of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and TN were mainly responsible for the variation in bacterial community structure. The occurrences of Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria were closely associated with higher temperature, higher concentrations of NH3-N and TN and a lower TN/TP ratio. This study may provide a theoretical basis for the water pollution control and ecological restoration in urban rivers under different pollution levels.	4.4
Ice flow velocity is used to estimate ice mass changes in glaciers and is a significant indicator of the stability of the Antarctica ice sheet in global change studies. The existing regional Antarctica ice flow speed maps are usually derived from radar or optical satellite observations of modern satellites since the 1970s. This paper presents a new analytical photogrammetric method for estimating Antarctica ice flow velocity fields by using film-based stereo ARGON photographs collected in the 1960s. The key of the proposed innovative method is a parallax decomposition that separates the effect of the terrain relief from the ice flow motion. An innovative implementation strategy is developed by using a framework that involves key techniques of hierarchical stereo image matching, ice flow direction determination, parallax decomposition, and ice flow speed estimation. This method is applied in the Rayner glacier in eastern Antarctica by using two sets of ARGON images with a two-month interval in 1963. The produced digital terrain model and speed map achieved a ground position accuracy of 61 m and a speed accuracy of 70 m a(-1). A comparison with recent products from 2000 to 2010 shows no significant topographic changes in the study area. Furthermore, the speed around the grounding line remained at the same level, while the speed in the ice shelf front decreased by 73 m a(-1.) The ice shelf front advanced by approximately 7 km over more than 40 years. Overall, the observation results indicate favorable conditions for the stability of the Rayner glacier-ice shelf system.	4.2
Land degradation affects large areas of land around the globe, with grave consequences for those living off the land. Major efforts are being made to implement soil and water conservation measures that counteract soil erosion and help secure vital ecosystem services. However, where and to what extent such measures have been implemented is often not well documented. Knowledge about this could help to identify areas where soil and water conservation measures are successfully supporting sustainable land management, as well as areas requiring urgent rehabilitation of conservation structures such as terraces and bunds. This study explores the potential of the latest satellite-based remote sensing technology for use in assessing and monitoring the extent of existing soil and water conservation structures. We used a set of very high resolution stereo Geoeye-1 satellite data, from which we derived a detailed digital surface model as well as a set of other spectral, terrain, texture, and filtered information layers. We developed and applied an object-based classification approach, working on two segmentation levels. On the coarser level, the aim was to delimit certain landscape zones. Information about these landscape zones is useful in distinguishing different types of soil and water conservation structures, as each zone contains certain specific types of structures. On the finer level, the goal was to extract and identify different types of linear soil and water conservation structures. The classification rules were based mainly on spectral, textural, shape, and topographic properties, and included object relationships. This approach enabled us to identify and separate from other classes the majority (78.5%) of terraces and bunds, as well as most hillside terraces (81.25%). Omission and commission errors are similar to those obtained by the few existing studies focusing on the same research objective but using different types of remotely sensed data. Based on our results, we estimate that the construction of the conservation structures in our study area in Eritrea required over 300,000 person-days of work, which underlines the huge efforts involved in soil and water conservation.

Living walls (LW) are innovative Urban Greening systems that represent a promising tool for sustainable construction and bioclimatic design. LW use a growing media to support plant establishment and growth in a vertical plane. A drip irrigation system is mandatory to be installed to supply water and nutrients to plants. As the number of LW installed in urban areas is rapidly growing, it is important to conduct studies to optimize irrigation water use. This work has therefore two main objectives: (i) optimizing irrigation scheduling in a non-recirculating outdoor LW installed near Seville (SE Spain), and (ii) assessing LW daily water needs over the summer period. The experimental setup consisted of two 2x1 m multilayer LW modules with a plant density of 36 plants m(-2). Each module consisted of two geotextile layers sewn together and forming 15x15 cm pockets, and a waterproof layer facing the wall. The system is attached to the wall by means of a metal profile. The drip irrigation system consisted of a PE drip line placed in the upper part of the LW with drippers spaced 15 cm. Water losses by drainage (i.e. runoff) were collected with a semi-circular gutter placed at the bottom of each LW module. Both water applied and water lost by drainage were recorded for each irrigation event with a volumetric water meter and rain gauge, respectively. The main microclimatic variables (solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity) were also recorded. The runoff hydrographs obtained for three different emitter discharge rates (2, 4 and 8 I/h), as well as the estimated LW water requirements are presented and discussed. The results indicate that, for lost solution systems, pulse drip irrigation is more suitable than applying irrigation times that maximize water distribution. Living Wall evapotranspiration was highly correlated with reference evaportranspiration, which allowed to derive a mean garden coefficient of 0.75.	4.1
The aim of the study was to test the feasibility of using commercially available computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology including 3Shape Dental System 2013 trial version, WIELAND V2.0.049 and WIELAND ZENOTEC T1 milling machine to design and fabricate complete dentures. The modeling process of full denture available in the trial version of 3Shape Dental System 2013 was used to design virtual complete dentures on the basis of 3-dimensional (3D) digital edentulous models generated from the physical models. The virtual complete dentures designed were exported to CAM software of WIELAND V2.0.049. A WIELAND ZENOTEC T1 milling machine controlled by the CAM software was used to fabricate physical dentitions and baseplates by milling acrylic resin composite plates. The physical dentitions were bonded to the corresponding baseplates to form the maxillary and mandibular complete dentures. Virtual complete dentures were successfully designed using the software through several steps including generation of 3D digital edentulous models, model analysis, arrangement of artificial teeth, trimming relief area, and occlusal adjustment. Physical dentitions and baseplates were successfully fabricated according to the designed virtual complete dentures using milling machine controlled by a CAM software. Bonding physical dentitions to the corresponding baseplates generated the final physical complete dentures. Our study demonstrated that complete dentures could be successfully designed and fabricated by using CAD/CAM.	3.0
The energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectroscopy was used to determine essential and trace element contents of some naturally grown wild-type cereals collected in different regions of Trabzon, Turkey. The samples were quantitatively analyzed using the standard addition method. The experimental set-up consisted of a Si(Li) detector, a multi-channel analyzer, and a Am-241 and Fe-55 radioactive source. The Si(Li) detector has a 13 mu m Be-window and energy resolution of about 160 eV at 5.9 keV. Qualitative analysis of spectral peaks showed that the samples contained chlorine, potassium, calcium, titanium, iron, copper, strontium, yttrium, tin and barium. The results demonstrated that these cereals contain elements of vital importance for the human metabolism.	6.2
There is very little information about human exposure to gaseous indoor air pollutants in the sleeping environment, even though the conditions in this environment are at least worrisome. The exposure during sleep is characterized by long exposure time, both absolute and relative, prevalence of specific pollutants and uncustomary proximity of sources to the breathing zone. This paper reports experimental results that show the impact of the proximity of possible emission sources such as a mattress, pillow and toy, on exposure of the sleeping subjects to these emissions. Based on full scale experiments in an environmental chamber using a breathing thermal manikin the intake fraction for gaseous pollutants are measured as well as the occurrence of rebreathing. Intake fractions for several sleep positions as well as different bedding arrangements are reported. The results show that human metabolism and corresponding heat release by the human body are dominant factors in the dilution of pollutants emitted in close proximity of the nose, reducing exposure by 40% compared to a case without metabolic heat output. This effect is more important than the sleep position. An important finding is that sleeping with the head under the covers increases intake by a factor 24 and results in a rebreathing rate of over 60%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.2
Large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) plays a central role in reducing CO2 emissions from energy supply systems, but intermittency from solar and wind technologies presents integration challenges. High temperature co-electrolysis of steam and CO2 in power-to-gas (PtG) and power-to-liquid (PtL) configurations could utilize excess intermittent electricity by converting it into chemical fuels. These can then be directly consumed in other sectors, such as transportation and heating, or used as power storage. Here, we investigate the impact of carbon policy and fossil fuel prices on the economic and engineering potential of PtG and PtL systems as storage for intermittent renewable electricity and as a source of low-carbon heating and transportation energy in the Alpine region. We employ a spatially and temporally explicit optimization approach of RES, PtG, PtL and fossil technologies in the electricity, heating, and transportation sectors, using the BeWhere model. Results indicate that large-scale deployment of PtG and PtL technologies for producing chemical fuels from excess intermittent electricity is feasible, particularly when incentivized by carbon prices. Depending on carbon and fossil fuel price, 0.15-15 million tonnes/year of captured CO2 can be used in the synthesis of the chemical fuels, displacing up to 11% of current fossil fuel use in transportation. By providing a physical link between the electricity, transportation, and heating sectors, PtG and PtL technologies can enable greater integration of RES into the energy supply chain globally.

A disruption of the oxytocin system seems to affect a variety of brain functions including emotions, mood and social behavior possibly underlying severe social deficits and susceptibility for substance use and mental health disorders. Early life adversity, such as insecure attachment in childhood, has been suggested to influence oxytocin tone contributing to a condition of neurobiological vulnerability. Aim of the present study was to investigate oxytocin serum levels in abstinent heroin addicted patients, in comparison with healthy controls, and the possible correlation with co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, aggressiveness and perception of parental neglect. Eighteen (18) abstinent patients, affected by heroin use disorders, and 18 control subjects, who never used drugs or abused alcohol, were included in the study and submitted to 1) collection of a blood sample for oxytocin assay, 2) Symptoms Check List 90 for psychiatric symptoms evaluation 3) Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory to measure aggressiveness 4) Child Experience of Care and Abuse-Questionnaire to retrospectively test the perception of parental neglect. Heroin exposure extent and heroin dosages were also recorded. Oxytocin serum levels were unexpectedly significantly higher among abstinent patients affected by heroin use disorders and positively correlated with psychiatric symptoms, aggressiveness and mother neglect scores. No correlation was evidenced between oxytocin and heroin exposure extent or dosages. Our findings appear to contradict the simplistic view of oxytocin as a pro-social hormone and confirm previous evidence concerning the peptide levels direct association with aggressive behavior and mood disorders. Considering a more complex mechanism, oxytocin would increase the sensitivity to social salience cues related to contextual or inter-individual factors, promoting pro-sociality in safe conditions and, in contrast, inducing more defensive and anti-social emotions and behaviors when the social cues are interpreted as unsafe. This latter condition is often characterizing the clinical history of addicted patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.0
Aim To replicate the genome-wide associations of the antihypertensive effects of bisoprolol and losartan in GENRES, using the Finnish patients of LIFE study. Patients & methods: We analyzed association of four SNPs with atenolol and three SNPs with losartan response in 927 Finnish LIFE patients (467 for atenolol and 460 for losartan). Results: rs2514036, a variation at a transcription start site of ACY3, was associated with blood pressure response to atenolol in men in LIFE. Response to bisoprolol was correlated to baseline plasma levels of N-acetylphenylalanine and phenylalanine (ACY3 substrate and end product, respectively) in GENRES study. NPHS1 variation rs3814995 was associated with losartan effect in LIFE. Conclusion: We provide support for two pharmacogenomic markers for beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor antagonists.	6.4
One of the most important of the nutrient intake values (NIVs) is the average nutrient requirement (ANR). The ANR is defined as an intake value that will be adequate for half of the individuals in a group of people with similar characteristics. It is used to estimate the prevalence of adequacy, and it serves as the basis for the individual nutrient level (INLx). The determination of adequacy is a complex process, with the resulting value of the ANR dependent on the criterion or functional outcome chosen to define nutrient adequacy. Because nutrients have multiple sites Of action in human metabolism, it is possible to demonstrate abnormal function in one parameter measured or observed as a result of inadequate intake of a nutrient, while other parameters requiring the same nutrient appear normal or within normal ranges. Thus, depending on the criterion of adequacy selected, the requirement for a given nutrient may be at a lower or a higher intake amount. In harmonizing development of NIVs, it is important to clearly identify the criterion of adequacy selected and the rationale for its selection. Rarely are available data sufficient to provide dose-response information from which to select a level of intake at which half of the individuals demonstrate adequacy and half appear to demonstrate inadequacy. Three levels of intake, of which at least one level of intake is below the requirement for most of the individuals in the sample, and one level of intake is above their requirement, are useful for establishing, a level at which half of the group might be considered to demonstrate adequacy. Types of human nutrient studies that may be used to obtain data are discussed, as well as characteristics Of the sample size needed to demonstrate adequacy. The variation in requirements is also an important aspect in predicting levels of intake that will have defined probabilities of adequacy for groups (to develop the INLx, where x is the defined probability chosen). An analysis of the origins of different types of variability is presented. When estimating energy requirements, a special case of NIVs, important issues must be considered. Additionally, an example of evaluating data used to establish an ANR for vitamin A, and the effect of variability in requirements for vitamin A, is provided.	6.2
We investigate properties of estimators obtained by minimization of U-processes with the Lasso penalty in the high-dimensional setting. Our attention is focused on the ranking problem that is popular in machine learning. It is related to guessing the ordering between objects on the basis of their observed predictors. We prove the oracle inequality for the excess risk of the considered estimator as well as the bound for the l(1) distance \(theta) over cap-theta*\(1) between the estimator and the oracle. Besides, we study properties of estimators on simulated data sets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
All clinically-used antipsychotics display similar affinity for both D-2 (D2R) and D-3 (D3R) receptors, and they likewise act as 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. They provide therapeutic benefit for positive symptoms, but no marked or consistent improvement in neurocognitive, social cognitive or negative symptoms. Since blockade of D-3 and 5-HT6 (5-HT6R) receptors enhances neurocognition and social cognition, and potentially improves negative symptoms, a promising approach for improved treatment for schizophrenia would be to develop drugs that preferentially act at D3R versus D2R and likewise recognize 5-HT6R. Starting from the high affinity 5-HT6R ligands I and II, we identified compounds 11a and 14b that behave as 5-HT6R ligands with significant selectivity for D3R over D2R. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Erosion wear in piping is an unavoidable degradation process in the oil and gas industry that causes pipe wall thinning and leads to economic losses and potentially produce personal injuries. The mechanism of pipe erosion remains poorly understood. This study focused on predicting the erosion of a tee junction (T) under various flow types during fracturing operation. The failure analysis of tee junction was determined from its macroscopic features and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and allowed definition of the failure mode and failure mechanism were defined, which appeared to be significantly different from what has been considered to be traditional. The failure analysis and fluid mechanics theory were used to build a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation method to predict the erosion of the tee junction. The model of two-phase flow in a tee junction indicated that the solid -phase flow is determined by combined effects of the main tube flow, the flow inertia, and the turbulent flow. The distribution of the erosion in the tee was significantly different for various flow types and the simulation results were consistent with the results of the failure analysis. This model of predicted local distribution of erosion wear can assist the monitoring of pipe walls to prevent accidents and reduce maintenance labor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.4
The importance of Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide in reinforcing effects of addictive drugs specially alcohol and psychostimulants has been stablished. Involvement of CART peptide in rewarding effects of opioids in brain has recently been reported. Here we have studied the expression of CART mRNA and peptide in the reward pathway in morphine-induced sensitization phenomenon and also evaluated the peptide level fluctuations in CSF and plasma. Male Wistar rats received 7-day morphine injection (20 mg/kg) and then after a 7-day washout period, a challenge dose of 10 mg/kg morphine was administered and locomotor activity and oral stereotypical behaviors were recorded. Besides, the expression level of CART mRNA and peptide in four important areas of the mesocorticolimbic reward pathway including nucleus accumbens, striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus were measured by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. The level of the peptide in CSF and plasma was measured by Elisa method. The expression level of CART mRNA and protein in brain regions and also the peptide level in CSF and plasma were significantly down-regulated after 7-day morphine administration. These reduced levels returned to nearly normal rates after 7-day wash-out period. Administration of morphine challenge dose led to significant upregulation of CART gene expression (both mRNA and peptide) in the brain, and elevation of peptide level in CSF and plasma in morphine-sensitized rats. It can be concluded that CART is released in the framework of reward pathway and may serve as an important neurotransmitter in the process of morphine dependence and sensitization.	5.0
The Golgi apparatus is a central organelle of the secretory pathway involved in the post-translational modification and sorting of lipids and proteins. In mammalian cells, the Golgi apparatus is composed of stacks of cisternae organized in polarized manner, which are interconnected by membrane tubules to constitute the Golgi ribbon, located in the proximity of the centrosome. Besides the processing and transport of cargo, the Golgi complex is actively involved in the regulation of mitotic entry, cytoskeleton organization and dynamics, calcium homeostasis, and apoptosis, representing a signalling platform for the control of several cellular functions, including signalling initiated by receptors located at the plasma membrane. Alterations of the conventional Golgi organization are associated to many disorders, such as cancer or different neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we examine the functional implications of modifications of Golgi structure in neurodegenerative disorders, with a focus on the role of Golgi fragmentation in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The comprehension of the mechanism that induces Golgi fragmentation and of its downstream effects on neuronal function have the potential to contribute to the development of more effective therapies to treat or prevent some of these disorders.

Individual cells in multicellular organisms constantly explore their microenvironment, or niche, to obtain spatial information that is used to regulate cell behavior to maintain tissue integrity. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important source of such spatial information. Binding of the integrin family receptors to the ECM triggers formation of integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) that link the ECM network to cellular cytoskeleton via remarkably large multiprotein complexes collectively referred to as the integrin adhesome. Recent advances in proteomics have enabled researchers to study the IAC composition in detail. Various biochemical IAC isolation methods and culture conditions have been employed to study the composition and dynamics of integrin-mediated adhesions mainly in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. These studies have led to identification of daunting lists of potential IAC components. This review focuses on the current status of proteomics-driven research seeking to understand integrin functions by comprehensive analysis of IAC components. These systems level approaches have revealed the complexity of biochemical and biomechanical signals that are processed at IACs and provide a novel insight into how these signals are conveyed to regulate cellular behavior.	6.1
Objectives: To assess the completeness of history-taking and physical-examination notes of junior doctors at King Abdulaziz University Hospital per the approach they learned in medical school. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed 860 admission notes written by 269 junior doctors (interns and residents) in an academic tertiary-care medical centre in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over a two-month period. Notes were evaluated for completeness using a checklist developed with reference to relevant medical textbooks. The checklist included 32 items related to history-taking and physical examination. Based on the review of the notes, checklist items were evaluated as complete, incomplete, not present, or not applicable according to set criteria. Data were analysed and summarised for information on the frequency and relative frequency of these types. Results: The history items varied in completeness. At the high end, asking about chief complaint and duration, associated symptoms, aggravating and relieving factors, and conducting systemic review were marked ` complete' in 74.2%, 81.7%, 80.4%, and 79.7% of notes, respectively. At the low end, asking about previous episodes, allergies, medications, and family history were complete in 5.3%, 1.9%, 4.8%, and 2.9% of notes, respectively. All physical examination items were poorly documented, especially breast examination, which was ` not present' in 95.8% of the notes. Conclusions: Junior doctors' history and physicalexamination notes are often incomplete and do not follow the approach taught in medical school. The reasons for this must be studied via focus-group discussions with junior doctors.	5.1
Background and aims: Recent research on problematic Facebook use has highlighted the need to develop a specific theory-driven measure to assess this potential behavioral addiction. The aim of the present study was to examine the factorial validity of the Problematic Facebook Use Scale (PFUS) adapted from Caplan's Generalized Problematic Internet Scale model. Methods: A total of 1,460 Italian adolescents and young adults (aged 14-29 years) participated in the study. Confirmatory factor analyses were performed in order to assess the factorial validity of the scale. Results: Results revealed that the factor structure of the PFUS provided a good fit to the data. Furthermore, results of the multiple group analyses supported the invariance of the model across age and gender groups. Discussion and conclusions: This study provides evidence supporting the factorial validity of the PFUS. This new scale provides a theory-driven tool to assess problematic use of Facebook among male and female adolescents and young adults.	5.0
Given a compact manifold M and a Riemannian manifold N of bounded geometry, we consider the manifold Imm(M, N) of immersions from M to N and its subset Imm mu(M, N) of those immersions with the property that the volume-form of the pull-back metric equals mu . We first show that the non-minimal elements of Imm mu(M,N) form a splitting submanifold. On this submanifold we consider the Levi-Civita connection for various natural Sobolev metrics, we write down the geodesic equation for which we show local well-posedness in many cases. The question is a natural generalization of the corresponding well-posedness question for the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, which is of importance in fluid mechanics.

The study of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has made significant progress over the last decade. Genome-wide association studies have identified and further substantiated the role of susceptibility genes outside the major histocompatibility complex locus. However, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 has been suggested to be important in the pathogenesis of AS, contributing to similar to 20.1% of AS heritability. The current review will present the classical and non-classical forms of HLA-B27, as well as their pathogenic roles, and further discuss the hypotheses regarding the potential pathogenesis of AS. In addition, the association between the pathogenic role of HLA-B27 and inflammatory indexes, including the interleukin-23/-17 axis will be investigated to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of AS. The aim of the present review is to provide an update of the current research into the pathogenesis of AS, and provide a comprehensive description of the pathogenic role of HLA-B27 in AS.	5.3
The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of specific exercise types on pulmonary functions, aerobic and functional capacity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A systematic search of Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, MEDLINE (EBSCO), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), CINAHL (EBSCO), PUBMED, AMED, EMBASE (OVID) was conducted in January 2016. The outcome measures were spirometric measurements, chest expansion, 6 minute walk distance (6MWD), pVO(2), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). The search strategy was applied with limitation of date and language and this initial electronic search resulted in 143 relevant studies. After duplicates were removed, the titles and abstracts of 52 articles were screened. Of these, 14 full-text articles met initial criteria and were retrieved for review, with eight studies meeting final inclusion criteria. Both specific and conventional exercise groups showed significant improvements in BASDAI and BASFI scores (p < 0.05) in patients with AS, although there was no significant difference between two exercise groups. As for pulmonary functions, the specific exercise groups have greater improvements than conventional group in spirometric measurement, chest expansion (p0.05). Specific exercises are an effective adjuvant therapy to enhance cardiopulmonary functions in patients with AS; therefore, it is assumed that in addition to the medical treatments, specific exercise therapy might reduce the cardiopulmonary complications related with AS.	5.3
The objective of this study was to assess the effect of silica nano-filler particle diameters in a computer-aided design/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite resin (CR) block on physical properties at the multi-scale in silico. CAD/CAM CR blocks were modeled, consisting of silica nano-filler particles (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100nm) and matrix (Bis-GMA/TEGDMA), with filler volume contents of 55.161%. Calculation of Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios for the block at macro-scale were analyzed by homogenization. Macro-scale CAD/CAM CR blocks (3x3x3mm) were modeled and compressive strengths were defined when the fracture loads exceeded 6075N. MPS values of the nano-scale models were compared by localization analysis. As the filler size decreased, Young's moduli and compressive strength increased, while Poisson's ratios and MPS decreased. All parameters were significantly correlated with the diameters of the filler particles (Pearson's correlation test, r=-0.949, 0.943, -0.951, 0.976, p<0.05). The in silico multi-scale model established in this study demonstrates that the Young's moduli, Poisson's ratios, and compressive strengths of CAD/CAM CR blocks can be enhanced by loading silica nanofiller particles of smaller diameter. CAD/CAM CR blocks by using smaller silica nano-filler particles have a potential to increase fracture resistance.	3.0
Background: Oral cancer is one of the most common malignant lesions of the head and neck. This cancer is an aggressive and lethal disease with no significant improvements in the overall survival in the last decades. Moreover, the incidence of oral HPV-positive tumors is rising, especially in young people. This oral neoplasm develops through numerous molecular imbalances that affect key genes and signaling pathways; however, the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of oral tumors are still to be fully determined. In order to improve the quality of life and long-term survival rate of these patients, it is vital to establish accurate biomarkers that help in the early diagnosis, prognosis and development of target treatments. Such biomarkers may possibly allow for selection of patients that will benefit from each therapy modality, helping in the optimization of intensity and sequence of the treatments in order to decrease side effects and improve survival. Conclusion: In this review we discuss the current knowledge of oral cancer and the potential role of omics approaches to identify molecular biomarkers in the improvement of early diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. The pursuit to improve the quality of life and decrease mortality rates of the oral patients needs to be centralized on the identification of critical genes in oral carcinogenesis. Understanding the molecular biology of oral cancer is vital for search new therapies, being the molecular-targeted therapies the most promising treatment for these patients.	6.0
The present study analyzed the capacity for mentalization of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and their first-degree relatives (FDR) and examined the implications of clinical variables and cognitive deficits. The study recruited 31 patients with type I BD, 18 FDR, and 31 paired healthy controls. Their capacity for mentalization was explored by means of first-and secondorder false-belief tasks, the hinting task, and the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC). Patients and FDR were found to have a theory of mind (ToM) deficit when they were evaluated with the MASC, which was also related to a worse neurocognitive performance and to being a patient or FDR. The evidence of ToM deficits in FDRs supports the hypothesis that these deficits could be an independent trait marker for cognitive deficit. Further research is needed on FDR of patients with BD, using sensitive ToM assessment instruments such as the MASC.	2.1
Necessary and sufficient conditions for the positivity and reachability of electrical circuits composed of resistors, coils and capacitors are given. The minimum energy control problem for the positive electrical circuits is formulated and solved. Procedure for computation of the optimal input and minimal value of the performance index is proposed and illustrated by a numerical examples.	1.2
Water pollution by organic compounds is one of the major challenges faced by industries that use dyeing processes. Thus, some methods were developed for degrading dyes in wastewaters, including heterogeneous photocatalysis by semiconductor oxides. However, these oxides have limited photocatalytic activity due to the fast recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The aim of this study is the use of a carbon nanotube (CNT) and TiO2-ZnO oxide junction from modified sol-gel method to promote the degradation of organic dye through the photocatalytic activity of these nanocomposites. TiO2-ZnO/CNT nanocomposites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and photocatalytic decomposition of organic dyes. The results of photocatalysis show up to 60% the efficiency of the samples in the removal of dye.	4.4
Climatic conditions are commonly considered the primary determinant of consumers' choices about energy use for heating. Besides, current regulations on the matter focus on the physical characteristics of the buildings, relying on a strict relationship between efficiency and savings. Nevertheless, the literature shows that energy demand determinants are difficult to be estimated with the accuracy required for predictive purposes, while the energy savings stemming from efficiency gains are partly outweighed by the consumers' behavior. We deal with these issues by analyzing spatial series data of natural gas consumptions for space heating and hot water production in the residential sector. The regression analysis takes four fields of covariates into account: climate, building characteristics, market aspects, and technological development. The estimation process is based on the following cornerstones: a spatially lagged dependent variable to deal with the problem of spatial autocorrelation, linear and logarithmic functional forms, and a two-stage interpolation strategy that is meant to provide unbiased estimates of both the dispersion matrix and the t-statistics by combining Ordinary Least Squares and Weighted Least Squares. The models turn out to be well specified, and their explanatory power is high, so the results are suitable for demand forecasting. Although the spatial autoregressive term does not appear among the significant regressors, we show that space does matter in shaping the natural gas consumption in different regions. Our analysis proves that heating gas demand is characterized by a positive elasticity to income. We use these results to provide estimates of the rebound effect. Nevertheless, the additional consumption directly attributable to an income effect is of moderate magnitude when the gas price does not vary. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
There are many ways to achieve knowledge. The experience presented in this paper is one that describes the knowledge achievement process thru knowledge models - in this case using concept maps. The subject of the experiment was to design a knowledge model on a technical subject: turning. The project participants were the students of the terminal year from the Engineering Faculty of Sibiu, Lucian Blaga University. Especially the technical field is one in which knowledge (information interpreted with a result) are hard to reach because of the important quantity of information which in the absence of the right connections made between them they remain raw dates, difficult to understand, hard to integrate in a real technical context in order to solve a given problem.	3.2
Mobile cloud computing uses features to deliver outsourcing data to remotely available mobile devices. However, the flexible nature of the mobile device is a critical challenge for the mobile cloud computing environment. The mobile phone significantly degrades the data transfer performance when initiating the handover process. Thus, an energy-efficient handover process could improve the quality of service (QoS). Here, we introduce a secure energy-efficient and quality-of-service architecture (EEQoSA) for the handover process in the mobile cloud computing environment. The proposed architecture involves four layers: application, the Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IPMS), communication, and media with connectivity layers. These four layers collectively handle the energy-efficiency, security and QoS parameters. Existing service-oriented architectures designed for mobile cloud computing are based on the symmetric encryption cryptography to support different media services. However, this approach easily allows an adversary to expose the symmetric key and gain access to private data. Thus, our proposed architecture uses the secure and strong authentication (SSA) process at the IPMS layer by protecting the media services from unauthorized users, as the IPMS is the central layer that could be the entry point for an adversary. Furthermore, to extend the mobile lifetime during the handover process, an energy detection (ED) model is deployed at the communication layer to detect the energy level of the mobile device prior to the handover initialization process. The media with the connectivity layer supports the secure handover process using a priority enforcement module that allows only legitimate users to complete the re-registration process after initiating the handover. Finally, the architecture is tested using the CloudSim simulation environment and validated by a comparison with other known service-oriented architectures.	0.3
In our pursue to study effective real-time feedback in Technology Enhanced Learning, we developed the Presentation Trainer, a tool designed to support the practice of nonverbal communication skills for public speaking. The tool tracks the user's voice and body to analyze her performance, and selects the type of real-time feedback to be presented. This paper describes an empirical study where we tested the effects of the Presentation Trainer's feedback on learners who used the tool while practicing for an elevator-pitch. Results from this study reveal that the feedback has a significant effect on the learners' motivation, confidence, self-awareness, and performance.	2.3
Just before the official launch of the DSM-5 in 2013, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative of the National Institute of Mental Health was made public and is becoming increasingly more important in psychiatric research. The aim of this paper is to clarify the conceptual approach of RDoC, to systematically discuss limitations, to present exemplary RDoC-based studies and to consider the relevance of the RDoC concepts for clinicians and scientists. The is a qualitative introduction and review article with a critical discussion. The RDoC initiative was not conceived as an alternative diagnostic manual to DSM-5 or IDC-10/11 for use in clinical practice. It is a new systematic framework for psychiatric research based on the most recent results of cognitive neuroscience and aims to map mental disorders dimensionally and transdiagnostically. Despite some weaknesses, it is currently the most elaborated and scientifically grounded approach for multidisciplinary research on mental disorders. In contrast to the purely symptom-based DSM and ICD approaches, which are agnostic with respect to the pathogenesis of mental diseases, the explicit aim of the RDoC initiative is to systematize biological knowledge about risk factors and causes of mental disorders; therefore, it has a much greater potential to develop new and individualized therapeutic strategies based on disease mechanisms.	5.4
Inspired by the special properties of the graph state, a quantum authentication scheme is proposed in this paper, which is implemented with the utilization of the graph state. Two entities, a reliable party, Trent, as a verifier and Alice as prover are included. Trent is responsible for registering Alice in the beginning and confirming Alice in the end. The proposed scheme is simple in structure and convenient to realize in the realistic physical system due to the use of the graph state in a one-way quantum channel. In addition, the security of the scheme is extensively analyzed and accordingly can resist the general individual attack strategies.	0.3
Rainwater harvesting, consisting in collecting runoff from precipitation, has been widely developed to stop groundwater declines and even raise water tables. However, this expected environmental effect is not self-evident. We show in a simple setting that the success of this conjunctive use depends on whether the runoff rate is above a threshold value. Moreover, the bigger the storage capacity, the higher the runoff rate must be to obtain an environmentally efficient system. We also extend the model to include other hydrological parameters and ecological damages, which respectively increase and decrease the environmental efficiency of rainwater harvesting.	4.3
The paper provides information about improvement of the weak clay soil with geotextile encased stone columns. The paper presents materials about the relevance of this technology for applying in Perm region of Russia. The article presents an overview and analysis of existing experimental studies on the subject, which allows identifying the area of the current study which aim is applying this technology to improve the weak bases of foundations of buildings and structures in geological condition of Perm region. Also paper considers the problem of estimating of deformations of improves soil base. Experimental studies consist of tests with use of triaxle equipment and stamp tests of big-scale models of geotextile encased stone columns. The conclusions about the effectiveness of geotextile encased stone columns were made on base of the results of experimental studies and analysis of existing materials. Also paper presents areas of possible cost-effective application of technology and the results of numerical simulation of test cases with using the finite element method.	4.1
In the new era of cyber-physical systems, software must adapt itself to ever-changing environmental conditions and situations. This is currently not reflected in the design of embedded operating systems, since they are primarily optimized for fixed usage scenarios with tight resource constraints. We discuss the idea of interpreted operating system kernels, which can form a new foundation for highly reconfigurable embedded systems. The paper elaborates reasonable use cases, shows comparable approaches from the past and sketches an implementation strategy that is based on a bare-metal Python interpreter.	0.4
Flow induced vibrations (FIVs) of a cylinder commonly occur where a cylindrical body is exposed to a flow. However, their appearance and behavior are widely diverging depending on flow condition and characteristics of cylinder with its supporting structure, making their prediction quite difficult. Hence, many serious accidents have been caused so far for structures and machines. Most typical and well-known FIVs in this category are the Karman vortex induced vibration (KVIV), the galloping and the torsional flutter. In this work, a very simple and convenient apparatus is designed and made to reproduce these three vibrations. This apparatus will be effective in a classroom lecture of fluid mechanics by demonstrating how easily the FIVs can be induced by a simple apparatus, even though their prediction remains to be important but difficult problems to be solved in practical engineering.	3.4
The selection of the appropriate implant material, stainless steel or titanium, is still the decision of the surgeon and/or the affiliated institution. Additionally, remarkable international differences can be found between the different markets, which cannot really be explained. A systematic literature search was performed to verify whether there is clinical evidence for the preference of one material over the other. The systematic literature search was performed utilizing the internet databases PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science. Comparative studies were included that reported on adult patients with osteosynthesis of extremities after trauma using either stainless steel or titanium implants. Information was extracted about infection rates, incidence of clinically relevant allergies, problems with implant removal and other complications. A total of 18 publications were identified to be eligible and 2 referenced articles were added. In summary, there is insufficient clinical evidence that the use of titanium or steel implants has a positive or negative effect on fracture healing, shows different rates of allergies, different rates of infections or mechanical failure. No supporting evidence could be identified for the difficulties with removal of titanium implants reported by surgeons. This systematic literature search did not provide any clinical evidence for material-related differences between titanium or stainless steel implants for fracture fixation. Based on the current clinical evidence both titanium and steel implants can be considered to be of equal value. The reported difficulties with implant removal are not reflected in the published literature.	5.1
Water pollution permit systems are challenging to design and implement. Operational systems that has maintained functionality remains few and far between, particularly in developing countries. We present current progress towards developing such a system for nutrient enrichment based water pollution, mainly from commercial agriculture. We applied a production function approach to first estimate the monetary value of the impact of the pollution, which is then used as reference point for establishing a reserve price for pollution permits. The subsequent market making process is explained according to five steps including permit design, terms, conditions and transactional protocol, the monitoring system, piloting and implementation. The monetary value of the impact of pollution was estimated at R1887 per hectare per year, which not only provide a management budget for filamentous green algae mitigation strategies in the study area, but also enabled the calculation of a reserve price for filamentous green algae pollution permits, which was estimated between R2.25 and R111 per gram filamentous algae and R8.99 per gram at the preferred state.

This paper presents the methodology that is being applied at present time for teaching and evaluation of different courses in the area of manufacturing processes engineering at the University of Leon. The context is delimited to the use of content management systems and continuous evaluation of learning. In particular, the Moodle platform is used for structuring the contents and for the continuous evaluation of courses in the scope of materials science, manufacturing processes and automation of operations. An analysis of the changes and challenges derived from the adoption of this methodology in the different courses in which has been applied is presented. These changes have been slightly different as a function of the compulsory or optional character of courses, as well as depending on the number of students enrolled in them.	3.2
We present a method for structural and fluid mechanics computations of ram-air parachutes. A ram-air parachute is a parafoil inflated by the airflow through the inlets at the leading edge. It has better control and gliding capability than round parachutes. Reliable analysis of ram-air parachutes requires accurate representation of the parafoil geometry, fabric porosity and the complex, multiscale flow behavior involved in this class of problems. The key components of the method are (i) the Space-Time Variational Multiscale (ST-VMS) method, (ii) the version of the ST Slip Interface (ST-SI) method where the SI is between a thin porous structure and the fluid on its two sides, (iii) the ST Isogeometric Analysis (ST-IGA), and (iv) special-purpose NURBS mesh generation techniques for the parachute structure and the flow field inside and outside the parafoil. The ST-VMS method is a stabilized formulation that also serves as a turbulence model and can deal effectively with the complex, multiscale flow behavior. With the STSI version for porosity modeling, we deal with the fabric porosity in a fashion consistent with how we deal with the standard SIs and how we enforce the Dirichlet boundary conditions weakly. The ST-IGA, with NURBS basis functions in space, gives us, with relatively few number of unknowns, accurate representation of the parafoil geometry and increased accuracy in the flow solution. The special-purpose mesh generation techniques enable NURBS representation of the structure and fluid domains with significant geometric complexity. The test computations we present are for building a starting parachute shape and a starting flow field associated with that parachute shape, which are the first two key steps in fluid-structure interaction analysis. The computations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in this class of problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.4
Objective: Neurocognition is known to impact functioning in individuals at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for psychosis, but studies investigating potential mediators of this relationship are scarce. Building on evidence from schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the study tested whether negative symptoms and social skills act as mediators between neurocognition and functional outcome in UHR individuals. Methods: Ultrahigh risk participants (N = 84) underwent neurocognitive testing using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. Social skills and negative symptoms were assessed using the High-Risk Social Challenge task and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms respectively. Four instruments were used to assess overall functioning, and one instrument assessed quality of life encompassing social functioning. Results: The cross-sectional analyses revealed that neurocognition was related to the measures of functioning. Negative symptoms mediated the relationship between neurocognition and four of the five measures of functioning. We did not find social skills to mediate between neurocognition and functioning. Conclusion: Negative symptoms appear to mediate the relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome in UHR individuals, but the finding needs to be confirmed and extended to longitudinal studies. This underscores the importance of focusing on both neurocognition and negative symptoms when aiming at improving the functional outcome of UHR individuals.	2.1
The laryngeal carcinoma related gene 1 (LCRG1) has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer. However, the microRNAs (small non-coding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length) that regulate LCRG1 expression remain elusive. In this study, quantitative PCR analysis first showed that the average level of miR-21-5p was elevated in primary laryngeal carcinoma tissues compared to paired adjacent non-tumor tissues. Thus, we explored the potential regulation of miR-21-5p on LCRG1. PITA algorithm predicted that two sites within LCRG1 mRNA 3'UTR, which reside at +743 position and +938 position, respectively, might be targeted by miR-21-5p. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-21-5p mimic specifically decreased luciferase activity of the reporter harboring 3'UTR+743 target site. With respect to the 3'UTR+938 site, the influence of miR-21-5p on luciferase activity was not sequence specific. Further, we observed that miR-21-5p mimic transfection decreased the LCRG1 protein in human laryngeal carcinoma Hep2 cells as indicated by Western blotting analysis, and promoted cell growth, migration and invasion as evidenced by MTT assay and transwell migration assay and matrigel invasion assay. Of note, the effects of miR-21-5p inhibitor treatment are opposite to those of the miR-21-5p mimic. Taken together, this study identifies that the tumor suppressor LCRG1 is targeted by the oncogenic miR-21-5p. This finding may help us to better understand the dysregulation of cancer-associated genes associated with microRNAs and eventually improve the diagnosis and target therapy for laryngeal carcinoma.	6.0
In this work the results obtained with the virtualisation of manufacturing processes engineering practices at Malaga University arc analyzed. This educative innovation tool allows to increase the efficiency of students learning because they can have available previously, by means of the computer, the different practise classes that they will do later. The results show this improvement obtained with the preliminary realization in virtual way in relation to make only an attended practise being present at the laboratory.	3.2
Nowadays, distributed denial of service (DDoS) becomes a major challenge in the network as it affects the network at multi-level. This leads to traffic overhead and wastage of bandwidth utilisation. In order to overcome these issues, ant-based DDoS detection technique using roaming virtual honeypots is proposed. In this technique, virtual roaming honeypot along with the multi-level secure architecture is used to collect the information about the various intruders at different levels in the network. Ant colony optimisation technique is used to detect the intruders based on the pheromone deposit on that considered area. A multi-level IP log table is used to detect the intruders at different levels of the network. Once the affected area is found, the information is sent to multi-level architecture to limit the spread of the affected area to the honeypot. This information is sent to the honeypot to make a defence system against the attackers. The advantage of the proposed technique is that it provides a full defence against DDoS at multi-level without creating any traffic overhead.	0.2
We posit that commercial Wi-Fi-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are vulnerable to common and basic security attacks, capable by beginner to intermediate hackers. We do this by demonstrating that the standard ARDiscovery Connection process and the Wi-Fi access point used in the Parrot Bebop UAV are exploitable such that the UAV's ability to fly can be disrupted mid-flight by a remote attacker. We believe that these vulnerabilities are systemic in Wi-Fi-based Parrot UAVs. Our approach observed the normal operation (i.e., ARDiscovery Connection process over Wi-Fi) of the Parrot Bebop UAV. We then used a fuzzing technique to discover that the Parrot Bebop UAV is vulnerable to basic denial of service (DoS) and buffer-overflow attacks during its ARDiscovery Connection process. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in catastrophic and immediate disabling of the UAV's rotors mid-flight. Also, we discovered that the Parrot Bebop UAV is vulnerable to a basic ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Cache Poisoning attack, which can disconnect the primary mobile device user and in most cases cause the UAV to land or return home. Based on the literature and our own penetration testing, we assert that Wi-Fi-based commercial UAVs require a comprehensive security framework that utilizes a defense-in-depth approach. This approach would likely mitigate security risks associated with the three zero-day vulnerabilities described in this paper as well as other vulnerabilities reported in the literature. This framework will be effective for Parrot Wi-Fi-based commercial UAVs and likely others with similar platforms.	0.2
Approach slabs serve as a transitional system between an approach road and a bridge. Settlement of bridge approach slabs and their supporting backfill has been reported by more than ten Departments of Transportation throughout the United States. According to current Wyoming Department of Transportation inspection reports, bridge approach slab settlements occurred not only on existing bridges but also on newly built bridges that were recently opened to traffic. These settlements typically create voids ranging from 150 mm to 305 mm (6-12 in.) between the base of the approach slab and the geotextile reinforced backfill. This research presents factors causing bridge approach slab settlements and provides appropriate design and construction recommendations. A comprehensive literature review pertaining to approach slabs was performed to examine outcomes of research conducted by 12 states. The current specifications and standards on bridge approach slabs of the corresponding states' Departments of Transportation were also evaluated. A nationwide survey was conducted to fill in the missing knowledge identified in the literature review. The results of the survey are categorized into three groups based on the percentage of bridges experiencing approach slab settlements in that state. Results of the survey show that 46% of the total 28 states are not satisfied with their current approach slab designs. The survey results revealed that the most common cause of approach slab settlement is poor construction practices. The most important finding of the survey is that performing in-situ tests to control backfill compaction reduces the amount of approach slab settlement. Using the lessons learned from the literature and the results of the survey, recommendations were developed for transportation agencies nationwide. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1
The advent of atomic force microscopy (AFM) has provided a powerful tool for investigating the behaviors of single native biological molecules under physiological conditions. AFM can not only image the conformational changes of single biological molecules at work with sub-nanometer resolution, but also sense the specific interactions of individual molecular pair with piconewton force sensitivity. In the past decade, the performance of AFM has been greatly improved, which makes it widely used in biology to address diverse biomedical issues. Characterizing the behaviors of single molecules by AFM provides considerable novel insights into the underlying mechanisms guiding life activities, contributing much to cell and molecular biology. In this article, we review the recent developments of AFM studies in single-molecule assay. The related techniques involved in AFM single-molecule assay were firstly presented, and then the progress in several aspects (including molecular imaging, molecular mechanics, molecular recognition, and molecular activities on cell surface) was summarized. The challenges and future directions were also discussed.	6.0
Background: Management of allergic patients in the population is becoming more difficult because of increases in both complexity and prevalence. Although general practitioners (GPs) are expected to play an important role in the care of allergic patients, they often feel ill-equipped for this task. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an allergy management support system (AMSS) for primary care. Methods: Through literature review, interviewing and testing in secondary and primary care patients, an allergy history questionnaire was constructed by allergists, dermatologists, GPs and researchers based on primary care and specialists' allergy guidelines and their clinical knowledge. Patterns of AMSS questionnaire responses and specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE)-test outcomes were used to identify diagnostic categories and develop corresponding management recommendations. Validity of the AMSS was investigated by comparing specialist (gold standard) and AMSS diagnostic categories. Results: The two-page patient-completed AMSS questionnaire consists of 12 (mainly) multiple choice questions on symptoms, triggers, severity and medication. Based on the AMSS questionnaires and sIgE-test outcome of 118 patients, approximately 150 diagnostic categories of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, anaphylaxis, food allergy, hymenoptera allergy and other allergies were identified, and the corresponding management recommendations were formulated. The agreement between the allergy specialists' assessments and the AMSS was 69.2% (CI 67.2-71.2). Conclusion: Using a systematic approach, it was possible to develop an AMSS that allows for the formulation of diagnostic and management recommendations for GPs managing allergic patients. The AMSS thus holds promise for the improvement of the quality of primary care for this increasing group of patients.	5.1
Objective: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate cognitive, social cognitive, and motivational deficits that contribute to impairment in real-world functioning. In the current study, we investigated the effects of supplementing computerized neurocognitive training with social cognitive exercises, as compared with neurocognitive training alone. Method: In this ongoing, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 111 participants with psychosis, we compare the effects of supplementing intensive targeted cognitive training with social cognitive training exercises (TCT + SCT) with the effects of targeted cognitive training alone (TCT-only). Participants were assessed on cognition, symptoms, functional capacity, and functional outcomes, as well as social cognition and measures related to reward processing. Results: Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in multiple cognitive domains and improvement in functional capacity. However, as predicted, TCT + SCT group participants showed significant improvement in prosody identification and reward processing relative to TCT-only participants. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Our findings indicate that supplementing intensive computerized cognitive training with social cognitive exercises in people with psychosis confers greater benefits in prosody identification and reward processing relative to cognitive training alone, even though both approaches drive significant improvements in cognition and functional capacity. Impairments in both prosody identification and reward processing have been associated with greater negative symptoms and poorer functional outcomes in schizophrenia, raising the possibility that this form of treatment may lead to better long-term outcomes than traditional cognitive training approaches. Follow-up assessments will determine whether results are durable and generalize over time to improvements in symptoms and functioning.	2.1
The application of synchronization theory to build new cryptosystems has been a hot topic during the last two decades. In this paper, we analyze a recent proposal in this field. We pinpoint the main limitations of the software implementation of chaos-based systems designed on the grounds of synchronization theory. In addition, we show that the cryptosystem under evaluation possesses serious security problems that imply a clear reduction of the key space.	0.3
This paper investigates the impact of tolerances related to permanent magnets on the cogging torque performance of PMSMs. These machines usually show a considerable sensitivity regarding tolerances for geometric dimensions and material characteristics. A consistent approach is presented in order to minimize the computational effort for evaluating the sensitivity, robustness, or reliability. Thereby, design of experiments is used to minimize the required number of finite element simulations. In this work, a Box-Behnken based approach is considered. Subsequently, a surrogate modeling technique based on a second-order equation is applied. As a consequence, a reduction of the computational cost by 96% is achieved. The obtained results are compared with outcomes solely derived by means of finite element computations and very good agreement is observed. This is illustrated by providing the probability distribution of the cogging torque for the considered machine design. In addition, the cumulative distribution is presented, which usually is applied for analyzing the reliability. Considering the analysis of the impact of tolerances as part of optimization scenarios increases the number of designs to be analyzed by at least one degree of magnitude. The here obtained results look promising for achieving this at feasible computational cost.	3.3
The hydrothermal electrochemical deposition (HED) synthesis NiSe2 as counter electrode(CE) of dyesensitized solar cells(DSSCs), which shows excellent catalytic activity in reduction of triiodide. Hydrothermal and electro-deposition(ED) have been widely used to synthetize NiSe2, herein, we fistly introduce the HED to produce the NiSe2 material as the CE of DSSCs. In addition, cyclic voltammetry(CV) curves, Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) indicated that HED-NiSe2 as CE shows better electrocatalytic activity for reduction of iodine/iodide electrolyte than ED-NiSe2 and Pt. The DSSC fabricated by the HED-NiSe2 CE displays a solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 8.24% comparing with 7.68% the convention Pt as reference, and significant higher than that of based on the ED-NiSe2(7.97%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the HED method is a promising way to design and synthesize advanced CE materials for utilizing solar energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.	1.0
Conventional high torque low speed drive systems commonly have a mechanical transmission between the induction motor and the load consisting of gears, gear heads, belt/pulleys or camshafts. The main drawbacks of such setups, are the deficiency of the drive system, its high cost and the maintenance needs. An alternative to this, is the replacement of the induction motor and its mechanical transmission elements with a permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor (PMSM) directly coupled to the load running at low speed. In this context, the paper deals with the design evaluation of a 5kW 50rpm motor and concentrates on two radial flux promising topologies i.e. with surface-mounted permanent magnets with inner and outer rotor. Since the goal is mainly the minimization of the machine's active weight (with respect to constraints related to outer dimensions, efficiency and cost), the designs of the PM machines are conducted by solving an optimization problem. Three optimization methods are adopted and three weighted cost functions are presented. The effectiveness of the methods in finding competitive alternative PMSM designs is then evaluated. The presented results are compared with other found in literature and reveal satisfactorily enhanced design solutions and performance of the proposed methods.	3.3
With the rapid development of electrical circuits, Micro electromechanical system (MEMS) and network technology, wireless smart sensor networks (WSSN) have shown significant potential for replacing existing wired SHM systems due to their cost effectiveness and versatility. A few structural systems have been monitored using WSSN measuring acceleration, temperature, wind speed, humidity; however, a multi-scale sensing device which has the capability to measure the displacement has not been yet developed. In the previous paper, a new high-accuracy displacement sensing system was developed combining a high resolution analog displacement sensor and MEMS-based wireless microprocessor platform. Also, the wireless sensor was calibrated in the laboratory to get the high precision displacement data from analog sensor, and its performance was validated to measure simulated thermal expansion of a laboratory bridge structure. This paper expands the validation of the developed system on full-scale experiments to measure both static and dynamic displacement of expansion joints, temperature, and vibration of an in-service highway bridge. A brief visual investigation of bridges, comparison between theoretical and measured thermal expansion are also provided. The developed system showed the capability to measure the displacement with accuracy of 0.00027 in.	1.2
Two articles recently published in Nature and Nature Cell Biology reported that early human embryos were successfully cultured beyond blastulation. This development heralds an important step toward exploring the unknown molecular events driving human pregastrulation development, but it inevitably raises the ante in the decades-old ethical debate on how to define early human life and how to save human lives through research without destroying another life in the process.

A well-established approach to developing new imaging agents and treatments for cancer begins with the recognition of receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (mu) and delta (delta) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or Tc-99m for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) or the delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEI( cells transfected with mu (HEK-mu) or delta (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity. These conjugates were abandoned from further development but information about their synthesis may be valuable to other laboratories working in this field. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	5.0
During embryogenesis, the spherical inner cell mass (ICM) proliferates in the confined environment of a blastocyst. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from the ICM, and mimicking embryogenesis in vitro, mouse ESCs (mESCs) are often cultured in hanging droplets. This promotes the formation of a spheroid as the cells sediment and aggregate owing to increased physical confinement and cell-cell interactions. In contrast, mESCs form two-dimensional monolayers on flat substrates and it remains unclear if the difference in organization is owing to a lack of physical confinement or increased cell-substrate versus cell-cell interactions. Employing microfabricated substrates, we demonstrate that a single geometric degree of physical confinement on a surface can also initiate spherogenesis. Experiment and computation reveal that a balance between cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions finely controls the morphology and organization of mESC aggregates. Physical confinement is thus an important regulatory cue in the three-dimensional organization and morphogenesis of developing cells.	6.0
Background: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling has emerged as a fundamental pathway in endothelial cell biology and deregulation of this pathway is implicated in several vascular disorders. BMP signalling output in endothelial cells is highly context-and dose-dependent. Phosphorylation of the BMP intracellular effectors, SMAD1/5/9, is routinely used to monitor BMP signalling activity. To better understand the in vivo context-dependency of BMP-SMAD signalling, we investigated differences in BMP-SMAD transcriptional activity in different vascular beds during mouse embryonic and postnatal stages. For this, we used the BRE::gfp BMP signalling reporter mouse in which the BMP response element (BRE) from the ID1-promotor, a SMAD1/5/9 target gene, drives the expression of GFP. Results: A mosaic pattern of GFP was present in various angiogenic sprouting plexuses and in endocardium of cardiac cushions and trabeculae in the heart. High calibre veins seemed to be more BRE:: gfp transcriptionally active than arteries, and ubiquitous activity was present in embryonic lymphatic vasculature. Postnatal lymphatic vessels showed however only discrete micro-domains of transcriptional activity. Dynamic shifts in transcriptional activity were also observed in the endocardium of the developing heart, with a general decrease in activity over time. Surprisingly, proliferative endothelial cells were almost never GFP-positive. Patches of transcriptional activity seemed to correlate with vasculature undergoing hemodynamic alterations. Conclusion: The BRE:: gfp mouse allows to investigate selective context-dependent aspects of BMP-SMAD signalling. Our data reveals the highly dynamic nature of BMP-SMAD mediated transcriptional regulation in time and space throughout the vascular tree, supporting that BMP-SMAD signalling can be a source of phenotypic diversity in some, but not all, healthy endothelium. This knowledge can provide insight in vascular bed or organ-specific diseases and phenotypic heterogeneity within an endothelial cell population.	6.1
This paper proposes a new high-temperature superconductor (HTS) dual-rotor flux-switching machine for directdrive wind energy conversion. The key is to adopt dual-rotor structure to improve utilizations of the HTS excitation field and the machine space, thus achieving a high power density. Also, the HTS excitation can easily achieve flexible flux regulation to keep armature voltage constant under time-varying wind speeds. The operation principle, with emphasis on the effect of relative position of both rotors on the magnetic circuits, is described in details. And the initial machine design, especially the split ratio optimization, has been done. By using the finite element analysis, the machine performances are analyzed, and its validity is verified.	3.3
Hydroidfest 2016 took place on September 23-25 at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory in Bodega Bay, CA. The meeting brought together cnidarian researchers, with an emphasis on those studying hydrozoans, from North America and other parts of the world. The scientific topics discussed were diverse, including sessions focused on development, regeneration, aging, immunology, symbiosis, and neurobiology. Thanks to the application of modern biological technologies, hydrozoans and other cnidarians are now fertile ground for research in numerous disciplines. Moreover, their amenability to comparative approaches is a powerful asset that was repeatedly showcased during the meeting. Here, we give a brief account of the work that was presented and the opportunities that emerged from the ensuing discussions.	6.3
The recent surge of network I/O performance has put enormous pressure on memory and software I/O processing subsystems. We argue that the primary reason for high memory and processing overheads is the inefficient use of these resources by current commodity network interface cards (NICs). We propose FlexNIC, a flexible network DMA interface that can be used by operating systems and applications alike to reduce packet processing overheads. FlexNIC allows services to install packet processing rules into the NIC, which then executes simple operations on packets while exchanging them with host memory. Thus, our proposal moves some of the packet processing traditionally done in software to the NIC, where it can be done flexibly and at high speed. We quantify the potential benefits of FlexNIC by emulating the proposed FlexNIC functionality with existing hardware or in software. We show that significant gains in application performance are possible, in terms of both latency and throughput, for several widely used applications, including a key-value store, a stream processing system, and an intrusion detection system.	0.4
Multicultural ideology proposes that group memberships should be not just acknowledged but also valued in order to accommodate diversity and attain equality. In three studies conducted in Spain and Canada we analyzed, using different measures, the relationship between multicultural ideology on the one hand and prejudice, support for social policies, and motivation for social change on the other hand. In Spain we focused on responses to Gitanos (Spanish Roma) and, in Canada, on First Nations people. Results showed that multicultural ideology was related in both cases to lower prejudice and higher support for social policies to support the minority group and motivation for social change. The internal motivation to control prejudice was an important mediator of this relationship in both countries. In contrast, the way in which social identities are represented played a different role as a function of country: whereas a dual identity representation played a mediating role in Canada, a common identity representation was the mediator in Spain. These results support the importance of valuing cultural diversity to harmonize intergroup relations and to reduce inequalities between majorities and minority groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Per a 9 is a major allergen of the American cockroach (CR), which has been recognized as an important cause of imunoglobulin E-mediated type I hypersensitivity worldwide. However, it is not neasy to obtain a substantial quantity of this allergen for use in functional studies. In the present study, the Per a 9 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) systems. It was found that 13/16 (81.3%) of the sera from patients with allergies caused by the American CR reacted to Per a 9, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirming that Per a 9 is a major allergen of CR. The induction of the expression of CD63 and CCR3 in passively sensitized basophils (from sera of patients with allergies caused by the American CR) by approximately 4.2-fold indicated that recombinant Per a 9 was functionally active. Three immunoinformatics tools, including the DNASTAR Protean system, Bioinformatics Predicted Antigenic Peptides (BPAP) system and the BepiPred 1.0 server were used to predict the potential B cell epitopes, while Net-MHCIIpan-2.0 and NetMHCII-2.2 were used to predict the T cell epitopes of Per a 9. As a result, we predicted 11 peptides (23-28, 39-46, 58-64, 91-118, 131-136, 145-154, 159-165, 176-183, 290-299, 309-320 and 338-344) as potential B cell linear epitopes. In T cell prediction, the Per a 9 allergen was predicted to have 5 potential T cell epitope sequences, 119-127, 194-202, 210-218, 239-250 and 279-290. The findings of our study may prove to be useful in the development of peptide-based vaccines to combat CR-induced allergies.	5.1
In this paper, we reviewed four key themes in the study of clean power transition in China, the resources potential, the technology advancement, the air pollution control, and the policy and reform of the power sector. In each theme, we summarized the ongoing research development and highlighted some key areas for further study. Given that China's power sector transition is a huge task, we hope this review will add some discussions into the ongoing conversation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1.0
Bacteria from the Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Chlamydiae (PVC) superphylum are exceptions to the otherwise dominant mode of division by binary fission, which is based on the interaction between the FtsZ protein and the peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis machinery. Some PVC bacteria are deprived of the FtsZ protein and were also thought to lack PG. How these bacteria divide is still one of the major mysteries of microbiology. The presence of PG has recently been revealed in Planctornycetes and Chlamydiae, and proteins related to PG synthesis have been shown to be implicated in the division process in Chlamydiae, providing important insights into PVC mechanisms of division. Here, we review the historical lack of observation of PG in PVC bacteria, its recent detection in two phyla and its involvement in chlamydial cell division. Based on the detection of PG-related proteins in PVC proteomes, we consider the possible evolution of the diverse division mechanisms in these bacteria. We conclude by summarizing what is known and what remains to be understood about the evolutionary cell biology of PVC division modes.	6.1
Control of harmful algae in the coves or bays of larger water bodies could be accomplished by hydraulic flushing with algae-free water. This suggestion is examined with a mathematical model of a harmful algal population, parameterized to represent the toxic haptophyte Prymnesium parvum, and its limiting nutrient. A small cove with a hydraulic storage zone and longitudinal advection and dispersion is coupled to a larger lake where ongoing or transient blooms serve as a source for the algal population. This population is transported upstream by dispersion and flushed downstream by advection. Morphometry and hydraulics represent a lake in Texas where blooms of P. parvum have been problematic. When dispersion and hydraulic storage are low to moderate, available pumping technology is predicted to be capable of suppressing the algal population within a variable portion of the cove, under both steady state and transient conditions. This suppression occurs when temperature-dependent algal growth is low. At temperatures high enough to support more rapid growth, flow augmentation carries a risk of stimulating a bloom under some hydraulic conditions. The model presented here complements similar models without population sources, and contributes to theoretical understanding of population persistence in reservoirs and other flowing-water habitats.

A numerical analysis is presented of cell adhesion in capillaries whose diameter is comparable to or smaller than that of the cell. In contrast to a large number of previous efforts on leukocyte and tumor cell rolling, much is still unknown about cell motion in capillaries. The solid and fluid mechanics of a cell in flow was coupled with a slip bond model of ligand-receptor interactions. When the size of a capillary was reduced, the cell always transitioned to bullet-like motion, with a consequent decrease in the velocity of the cell. A state diagram was obtained for various values of capillary diameter and receptor density. We found that bullet motion enables firm adhesion of a cell to the capillary wall even for a weak ligand-receptor binding. We also quantified effects of various parameters, including the dissociation rate constant, the spring constant, and the reactive compliance on the characteristics of cell motion. Our results suggest that even under the interaction between P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and P-selectin, which is mainly responsible for leukocyte rolling, a cell is able to show firm adhesion in a small capillary. These findings may help in understanding such phenomena as leukocyte plugging and cancer metastasis.	3.4
Although the brushless Doubly-Fed Induction Machine (DFIM) has great potential as generator system in large-scale wind turbines, its complexity has so far retained a commercial breakthrough. This paper contributes by combining brushless DFIM Finite Element (FE) modelling with multi-objective optimization. A static brushless DFIM FE model is applied with the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm. The result is an accurate and fast brushless DFIM design optimization tool. This tool is then used to generate a machine design with optimized performance, that fits a fixed volume frame size D180. Optimization results of different brushless DFIM construction variations are compared. The best designs of each construction variation are then analysed in more detail using a time-stepping brushless DFIM FE model. This provides good insight in the effects of different construction variations on torque ripple and induced time-harmonics. The optimized design of the best construction variation will be selected to be manufactured as prototype machine.	3.3
Home energy management system (HEMS) is essential for residential electricity consumers to participate actively in demand response (DR) programs. Dynamic pricing schemes are not sufficiently effective for end-users without utilizing a HEMS for consumption management. In this paper, an intelligent HEMS algorithm is proposed to schedule the consumption of controllable appliances in a smart household. Electric vehicle (EV) and electric water heater (EWH) are incorporated in the HEMS. They are controllable appliances with storage capability. EVs are flexible energy-intensive loads, which can provide advantages of a dispatchable source. It is expected that the penetration of EVs will grow considerably in future. This algorithm is designed for a smart household with a rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system integrated with an energy storage system (ESS). Simulation results are presented under different pricing and DR programs to demonstrate the application of the HEMS and to verify its' effectiveness. Case studies are conducted using real measurements. They consider the household load, the rooftop PV generation forecast and the built-in parameters of controllable appliances as inputs. The results exhibit that the daily household energy cost reduces 29.5%-31.5% by using the proposed optimization-based algorithm in the HEMS instead of a simple rule-based algorithm under different pricing schemes.

Nonverbal behavior plays a crucial role in human communication and often leads to misunderstandings between people from different cultures, even if they speak the same language fluently. While translation systems are available for verbal communication, translators for nonverbal communication do not exist yet. We present the conceptual design and an early prototype of a real-time gesture translator using body tracking and gesture recognition in avatar-mediated intercultural interactions. It contributes to the ambitious goal of bridging between cultures by translating culture-specific gestures to enhance mutual understanding. Possible applications of the gesture translator are discussed as a facilitating tool for global business meetings and as a means of technology-enhanced conflict resolution and prevention.	2.3
The paper proposes to evaluate achievement of main results in operation of intellectual mechatronic systems with digital control by the obtained information effect. In this respect, common information requirements with intellectual components are considered as a basic information factor which influences on the process of mechatronic system designing. Therefore, some parameters have been accentuated and they can help to provide rather complete description of the processes used for obtaining and using systematic information within the volume of the intellectual mechatronic system. Conformity degree of control vector parameters synthesized by the system and identification results of its current states have been selected as an information criterion of the control efficiency. A set of expected probability values for location of each parameter of an control object and a mechatronic system within the required tolerances has been used for formation of possible states. The paper shows that when a complex information description of the system is used then it is expedient to use an expert assessment of selection probability for allowable control vectors which ensure a system transfer to favorable states. This approach has made it possible to pinpoint main information and technical specifications of the intellectual mechatronic system: structural construction (informational and technical compatibility and information matching of its components); control object (uncertainty of its state and information vector, information capacity of the mechatronic system); control actions (their hierarchy and entropic balance of control process, managerial resource of mechatronic system); functioning result (informational effect and control efficiency criterion, probabilistic selection of system states). In accordance with the fulfilled analysis it is possible to note the most effective directions for practical use of the proposed informational approach for creation of the intellectual mechatronic system: comparison of alternative design solutions based on the analysis of calculation assessments on unconditional entropy of the control object and the system; simulation with the aim to accept a final systematic option while constructing digital controlling block of the created system; complex application of experts' knowledge, most comprehensive introduction of knowledge to the process of mechatronic system designing.	1.4
Ecology and ecotoxicology have different historical roots, despite their similar names, but are slowly converging to meet the challenge of addressing the massive global proliferation and release of chemicals in the environment. The conceptual, methodological, review and standard research papers in this special issue reflect this emerging trend of blending ecological and ecotoxicological perspectives to assess impacts in freshwater ecosystems. Assessing community and ecosystem impacts of chemical contaminants is complex, however, and will require approaches that explicitly consider biological and chemical diversity as well as the natural variability of environmental factors at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Central themes of the papers in this issue are (i) the importance of indirect effects of chemical contaminants on species interactions and food webs; (ii) effects of multiple stressors, especially interactions between contaminants and environmental factors; (iii) consequences of chemical exposure on ecosystem processes such as primary production and litter decomposition; (iv) the need to account for context dependency and (v) potentially harmful community and ecosystem effects of emerging contaminants, among which nanoparticles are prominently represented. Collectively, these papers show that integrating ecological principles into the design and implementation of ecotoxicological research is essential for assessing and predicting contaminant impacts on biological communities and ecosystems. Conversely, applied ecology and bioassessment would benefit from concepts and approaches developed in ecotoxicology and from fully embracing chemical contaminants as key drivers of community structure and ecosystem processes.	4.4
Africa faces many health challenges despite sustained growth and development over the past decade. Contributory factors are the lack of financial resources, an inadequate health professional workforce, a high burden of communicable diseases, and an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Rheumatology services are limited or non-existent in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Over the past decade, partnerships with international academic institutions have resulted in some progress in the training of rheumatologists and health professionals and development of rheumatology services in countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia. Basic diagnostic tests, biological agents, and arthroplasty are either unavailable or not affordable by the majority of the population. Urbanization has resulted in a change in the epidemiology of rheumatic diseases with an increase in the prevalence of gout, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma over the past four decades. Future growth of rheumatology services will depend on identifying committed individuals in underserved countries for training and supporting them to educate medical students, physicians, and health professionals in their home countries. There is a need to develop models of care using all categories of health workers and identify prevention strategies and cost-effective management programs for low resource settings. Africa affords an opportunity for collaborative research, including genetic and epigenetic studies, to improve our understanding of many of the rheumatic diseases.	6.4
Low levels of pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in aquatic environments worldwide, but their human and ecological health risks associated with low dose environmental exposure is largely unknown due to the large number of these compounds and a lack of information. Therefore prioritization and ranking methods are needed for screening target compounds for research and risk assessment. Previous efforts to rank pharmaceutical compounds have often focused on occurrence data and have paid less attention to removal mechanisms such as human metabolism. This study proposes a simple prioritization approach based on number of prescriptions and toxicity information, accounting for metabolism and wastewater treatment removal, and can be applied to unmeasured compounds. The approach was performed on the 200 most-prescribed drugs in the US in 2009. Our results showed that under-studied compounds such as levothyroxine and montelukast sodium received the highest scores, suggesting the importance of removal mechanisms in influencing the ranking, and the need for future environmental research to include other less-studied but potentially harmful pharmaceutical compounds.

In this paper, we propose a communication support tool for understanding emotion in an unstable narrowband network. The tool can reflect some emotion with a selected voice to character-based real time communication such as chat. The voice data is transmitted asynchronously and stored in local storage. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of communication to play voice data according to emotion, we implemented web-based voice contents classified according to some massage types and primitive emotion.	2.3
Since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor over 6 million years ago, human metabolism has changed dramatically. This change includes adaptations to a high-quality diet, the evolution of an energetically expensive brain, dramatic increases in endurance abilities, and capacity for energy storage in white adipose tissue. Human metabolism continues to evolve in modern human populations in response to local environmental and cultural selective forces. Understanding the nature of these selective forces and the physiological responses during human evolution is a compelling challenge for evolutionary biologists. The complex genetic architecture surrounding metabolic phenotypes indicates that selection probably altered allelic frequencies across many loci in populations experiencing adaptive metabolic change to fit their environment. A recent analysis supports this hypothesis, finding that classic selective sweeps at single loci were rare during the past 250 000 years of human evolution. Detection of selective signatures at multiple loci, as well as exploration of physiological adaptation to environment in humans, will require cross-disciplinary collaboration, including the incorporation of biological pathway analysis. This review explores the Thrifty Genotype Hypothesis, high-altitude adaptation, cold-resistance adaptation, and genetic evidence surrounding these proposed metabolic adaptations in an attempt to clarify current challenges and avenues for future progress.	6.2
The ability to recognize and adequately interpret emotional states in others plays a fundamental role in regulating social interaction. Body language presents an essential element of nonverbal communication which is often perceived prior to mimic expression. However, the neural networks that underlie the processing of emotionally expressive body movement and body posture are poorly understood. 33 healthy subjects have been investigated using the optically based imaging method functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during the performance of a newly developed emotion discrimination paradigm consisting of faceless avatars expressing fearful, angry, sad, happy or neutral gait patterns. Participants were instructed to judge (a) the presented emotional state (emotion task) and (b) the observed walking speed of the respective avatar (speed task). We measured increases in cortical oxygenated haemoglobin (O2HB) in response to visual stimulation during emotion discrimination. These O2HB concentration changes were enhanced for negative emotions in contrast to neutral gait sequences in right occipito-temporal and left temporal and temporo-parietal brain regions. Moreover, fearful and angry bodies elicited higher activation increases during the emotion task compared to the speed task. Haemodynamic responses were correlated with a number of behavioural measures, whereby a positive relationship between emotion regulation strategy preference and O2HB concentration increases after sad walks was mediated by the ability to accurately categorize sad walks. Our results support the idea of a distributed brain network involved in the recognition of bodily emotion expression that comprises visual association areas as well as body/movement perception specific cortical regions that are also sensitive to emotion. This network is activated less when the emotion is not intentionally processed (i.e. during the speed task). Furthermore, activity of this perceptive network is, mediated by the ability to correctly recognize emotions, indirectly connected to active emotion regulation processes. We conclude that a full understanding of emotion perception and its neural substrate requires the investigation of dynamic representations and means of expression other than the face.

Scarcity of water, pollution load, political issues and rising population have drawn great attention for proper management of water resources such as groundwater in the 21st century. The evaluation of groundwater quality is a critical element in the assessment of water resources. The quality/potability of water that is consumed defines the baseline of protection against many diseases and infections. The present study aims to calculate the water quality index (WQI) by the analysis of seven physicochemical parameters according to the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) to assess the suitability of water for drinking, irrigation purposes and other human uses. In the present investigation, ten groundwater samples were collected from various parts of Seraidi municipality area located in the north-east of Algeria, Physico-chemical parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphates, nitrates, turbidity and fecal coliforms were analyzed. The overall WQI values for all the samples were found to be in the range of 68-86, which reveals the fact that the quality of all the samples is only medium to good and could be used for drinking and other domestic uses only after proper treatment.	4.4
There is current interest in harnessing the combined anticancer and immunological effect of nano particles (NPs) and RNA. Here, we evaluate the bioactivity of poly I:C (pIC) RNA, bound to anticancer zinc oxide NP (ZnO-NP) against melanoma. Direct RNA association to unfunctionalized ZnO-NP is shown by observing change in size, zeta potential, and absorption/fluorescence spectra upon complexation. RNA corona was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the first time. Binding constant (K-b = 1.6-2.8 g(-1) L) was determined by modified Stern-Volmer, absorption, and biological surface activity index analysis. The pIC ZnO-NP complex increased cell death for both human (A375) and mouse (B16F10) cell lines and suppressed tumor cell growth in BALB/C-B16F10 mouse melanoma model. Ex vivo tumor analysis indicated significant molecular activity such as changes in the level of phosphoproteins JNK, Akt, and inflammation markers IL-6 and IFN-gamma. High throughput proteomics analysis revealed zinc oxide and poly I:C-specific and combinational patterns that suggested possible utility as an anticancer and immunotherapeutic strategy against melanoma.	6.3
Previous research has repeatedly demonstrated the importance of culture and cultural identification to interpersonal understanding. We aimed to apply the ideas from this domain to mental state reasoning, or theory of mind. We thus investigated the relationship between acculturation and inferring the mental states of other people within and across cultures by measuring Caucasian and East Asian participants' accuracy in inferring the mental states of own- and other-ethnicity targets using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. As expected, Caucasian participants showed a significant ingroup advantage in inferring the mental states of own- versus other-ethnicity targets but no variation according to measures of acculturation. More important, East Asian residents of Canada showed greater accuracy for own- versus other-ethnicity targets and their accuracy for Caucasian targets increased as a function of (i) the time they had lived in Canada, (ii) their experience interacting with Caucasians, (iii) increased endorsement of mainstream Canadian values, and (iv) decreased endorsement of their heritage culture's values. These results suggest that cross-cultural understanding may be malleable to acculturation and cultural experience, highlighting the importance of further research on how people from different cultural perspectives come to understand each other and subsequently ameliorate cross-cultural misunderstanding.

This paper investigates the influence of switching frequency and modulation index combined with welding on the iron losses in thin silicon-iron and nickel-iron lamination sheets of a small slotless permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). First, measurements are conducted on welded and nonwelded stator ring cores for switching frequencies between 1 and 20 kHz and modulation indexes of 0.4, 0.7, and 0.9, keeping constant fundamental flux density peak values. This is possible by changing the dc-link voltage of the inverter. The obtained measurement data are afterward used in finite-element method simulations to investigate the inverter influence on the performance of the PMSM.	3.3
Light determines macrophyte distribution, community composition and biomass in shallow lakes. Therefore, it is vital to determine the critical underwater light climate thresholds for macrophyte degradation and recovery. In this study, we first proposed a novel index, defined as the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to water depth (WD), as a measure of the underwater light supply for macrophytes. The underwater light environment in Lake Taihu (a large, shallow, eutrophic lake) was then characterized based on this index (Z(eu)/WD) using field measurements collected from 2006 to 2013 (8 years x 4 seasons x 32 sites). The distribution of the macrophyte presence frequency (MPF, the number of investigations that identified macrophytes divided by the total number of investigations) was greater than 0.70 in Xukou Bay and East Lake Taihu over the 32 investigations, followed by the other sites distributed in East Lake Taihu. The proportion of macrophyte coverage increased with the increase in Z(eu)/WD. A significant relationship was observed between Zeu/WD and MPF for the 19 sites with macrophytes (r(2) = 0.48, p< 0.001, n = 19). In the region with high nutrient concentrations and serious water pollution, better underwater light conditions are required for the growth of macrophytes. A Z(eu)/WD value of 0.80 can be regarded as the critical underwater light threshold for the growth of macrophytes in Lake Taihu. The region with Z(eu)/WD ranging between 0.57 and 0.80 was usually covered by sparse macrophytes; this region should be vital for macrophyte recovery and environmental management in Lake Taihu. The distribution of Z(eu)/WD was further obtained using MODIS satellite-derived Zeu from June to October in 2003 and 2013. Xukou Bay and Guangfu Bay in the southern part of Lake Taihu could be regarded as potentially crucial regions for the recovery of macrophytes from the perspective of underwater light and nutrient levels.

This research focuses on official postgraduate studies, which develop in the field of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering in open teaching. To obtain the data, combined analysis of teachers (internal vision) and student surveys (external view). The results from the insight they give an idea of activities designed, although focused on knowledge, abilities and technology skills, combining a methodology that implicitly has contemplated generic skills; moreover, the external view corroborate it, especially considering the student profile and the specialty studied, but also detect some aspect of improving.	3.2
Negative impedance converters (NICs) have been proposed as structures to improve the performance of RF circuits and electrically small antennas. However, NICs suffer from stability problems. This paper presents a compact procedure to analyze the stability of NICs. Then, the required and sufficient conditions to predict the stability of a negative impedance converter are given. These conditions can be evaluated using standard computer-aided design software. Finally, a NIC prototype is given to validate and illustrate the presented design procedure, it is also integrated with a printed, blade-type, electrically small monopole in the VHF band.	3.0
Measuring post-fire effects at landscape scales is critical to an ecological understanding of wildfire effects. Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.

After a coal mining accident, the key to the success of the coal mining emergency rescue is that the trapped miners are still alive before the rescue passage are made through. As new life-saving equipment, life-saving foods are used to maintain the viability and the self-saving ability of the front-line miners when they are trapped in the coal mining accident. The life-saving food will effectively extend the self-save time for the trapped miners and then essentially improve the rescued possibility of the trapped miners. The amount of human metabolism, which was measured under the hot and humid environment, determines salt targets and nutrition indexes of the life-saving food. According to the particularity of underground environment, the passage explores the method to store the life-saving food and how to reasonably select the storage locations. Reviewing the application of the mine life-saving food, we can conclude that the self-saving food will have a better future in the economic and social aspects. But it still needs to be demonstrated whether it is necessary to carry the food with the human body. When the life-saving food is exposed under the hot and humid environment, the deterioration cure is still unclear.	6.2
Background Insulin sensitivity is a key function in human metabolism because it has a crucial role in the development of disease that are increasingly common in modern society. Impaired insulin sensitivity is an important determinant of type 2 diabetes; moreover, it has been proposed as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Thus, reduced insulin sensitivity is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, which represents a cluster of metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular risk factor. Insulin sensitivity can be modulated by different environmental factors, including dietary habits. Obesity, especially if associated with abdominal adiposity, impairs insulin-sensitivity while physical activity can improve it; however, the composition of the habitual diet is clearly an important regulator of this function. Aim To evaluate methodologies and markers that can be used to substantiate existing and potential claims of beneficial effects of foods on relevant functions connected with body fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation. Results We have reviewed the scientific basis for existing and potential claims, based not only on modifications of the target functions (body fat deposition, insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation) but also on modifications of other relevant associated functions (energy intake, energy expenditure, fat storage and oxidation, lipotoxicity, body fat composition, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular function, glucose production and utilization). In this context we have identified a number of markers and evaluated appropriate method to measure and validate them. Conclusions Relevant functions contributing to overweight, the metabolic syndrome and diabetes have been identified. The evidence reviewed indicates that in this field the link between nutrition, biological responses and diseases is clearly established. Therefore, there is a stromg potential to develop functional food science. The major gap in the evidence continues to be the lack of diet based intervention trials of sufficient duration to be relevant for affecting the natural history of these conditions.	6.2
In filamentary RRAM, the role of self-heating in set/reset (by ion transport) is well established. However, in nonfilamentary Pr0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (PCMO) RRAM, self-heating during set/reset has not been explored. Recently, we have shown self-heating to explain nonlinearity in dc IV characteristics. In this paper, we present the observation of self-heating using transient current during pulses. We show that the cooling timescale is limited bymeasurement system timescale (similar to 30 ns). The self-heating-based experimental current transient timescale is longer (50-100 ns) and is not described by simple exponential decay. To explain this behavior, self-heating in PCMO RRAM (where Joule heating and current increase create a positive feedback) is implemented into technology computer aided design simulations. Simulations produce excellent agreement with experiments. Eventually, simulations deviate from experiments when thermally assisted ionic transport during set/reset is not included in the model. To interrupt the continuous self-heating, an n-pulse-train with cooling time between pulses versus single pulse-based set/reset experiment was designed with the same peak bias time. Set/reset effectiveness degrades as n increases while effect of increasing cooling time confirmed a cooling timescale of similar to 30 ns. Overall, self-heating provides a consistent explanation of the transient currents. Thus, this paper establishes that self-heating considerations must be included for PCMO-based RRAM modeling and design.	3.0
The fluid mechanics of microfluidics is distinctively simpler than the fluid mechanics of macroscopic systems. In macroscopic systems effects such as non-laminar flow, convection, gravity etc. need to be accounted for all of which can usually be neglected in microfluidic systems. Still, there exists only a very limited selection of channel cross-sections for which the Navier-Stokes equation for pressure-driven Poiseuille flow can be solved analytically. From these equations, velocity profiles as well as flow rates can be calculated. However, whenever a cross-section is not highly symmetric (rectangular, elliptical or circular) the Navier-Stokes equation can usually not be solved analytically. In all of these cases, numerical methods are required. However, in many instances it is not necessary to turn to complex numerical solver packages for deriving, e.g., the velocity profile of a more complex microfluidic channel cross-section. In this paper, a simple spreadsheet analysis tool (here: Microsoft Excel) will be used to implement a simple numerical scheme which allows solving the Navier-Stokes equation for arbitrary channel cross-sections.	3.4
The concept of stereotype, an important topics of social psychology is closely related to prejudice and discrimination. Stereotypes may drag people into generalization and failure in judgements in addition to many unwanted behavioral outcomes. The first section of the article deals with the definition of the concept of stereotype and ascertains the motives of individuals who intend acting in accordance with stereotypes, followed by offering various solutions to this very problem. The second section points out the effect of stereotypes on interpretation of the social judgement and the social cognition while the third section dwells on how stereotypes can be changed. This study, which presents a summary of the researches about the stereotype and the social judgement is of importance in terms of indicating how stereotypes turn into prejudices and how they eventually cause discrimination.	2.2
Computer vision-based human activity recognition (HAR) has become very famous these days due to its applications in various fields such as smart home healthcare for elderly people. A video-based activity recognition system basically has many goals such as to react based on people's behavior that allows the systems to proactively assist them with their tasks. A novel approach is proposed in this work for depth video based human activity recognition using joint-based motion features of depth body shapes and Deep Belief Network (DBN). From depth video, different body parts of human activities are segmented first by means of a trained random forest. The motion features representing the magnitude and direction of each joint in next frame are extracted. Finally, the features are applied for training a DBN to be used for recognition later. The proposed HAR approach showed superior performance over conventional approaches on private and public datasets, indicating a prominent approach for practical applications in smartly controlled environments.	0.0
Bioremediation plays an important role in oil spill management and bio-electrochemical treatment systems are supposed to represent a new technology for both effective remediation and energy recovery. Diesel removal rate increased by four times in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) since the electrode served as an electron acceptor, and high power density (29.05 W m(-3)) at current density 72.38 A m(-3) was achieved using diesel (v/v 1%) as the sole substrate. As revealed by Scanning electron microscope images, carbon fibres in the anode electrode were covered with biofilm and the bacterial colloids which build the link between carbon fibres and enhance electron transmission. Trace metabolites produced during the anaerobic biodegradation were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These metabolites may act as emulsifying agents that benefit oil dispersion and play a vital role in bioremediation of oil spills in field applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Much research has established a negative association between gender nonconformity and psychological health. Less is known however regarding factors that may attenuate the link between gender nonconformity and psychological health. The present study aimed to investigate the association between gender nonconformity and psychological health in a Singaporean sample, and to examine trait mindfulness and self-compassion as potential moderators of the association. A community sample of 206 adults was recruited and completed an online survey anonymously. The survey included measures of gender nonconformity, sexual orientation, trait mindfulness, self-compassion, depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being. Results showed that gender nonconformity positively and significantly predicted depressive symptoms, and negatively predicted subjective well-being. Trait mindfulness moderated the association between gender nonconformity and depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being respectively, with the direction of the moderation effects indicating the role of trait mindfulness as a protective factor against psychological distress. Self-compassion moderated the relationship between gender nonconformity and subjective well-being. Specifically, the association between gender nonconformity and subjective well-being was positive at high levels of self-compassion, and negative at low levels of self-compassion. While cross-sectional in nature, the findings provide preliminary support for the role of trait mindfulness and self-compassion as potential buffers against negative psychological effects of gender nonconformity.	5.4
We present a challenging new dataset for autonomous driving: the Oxford RobotCar Dataset. Over the period of May 2014 to December 2015 we traversed a route through central Oxford twice a week on average using the Oxford RobotCar platform, an autonomous Nissan LEAF. This resulted in over 1000 km of recorded driving with almost 20 million images collected from 6 cameras mounted to the vehicle, along with LIDAR, GPS and INS ground truth. Data was collected in all weather conditions, including heavy rain, night, direct sunlight and snow. Road and building works over the period of a year significantly changed sections of the route from the beginning to the end of data collection. By frequently traversing the same route over the period of a year we enable research investigating long-term localization and mapping for autonomous vehicles in real-world, dynamic urban environments. The full dataset is available for download at: http://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk	0.0
The development of wireless Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) aimed to enhance road's safety and provide comfortable driving environment by delivering early warning and infotainment messages. Intentional jamming attacks target at undermining such a goal by disrupting wireless communications. While detecting jamming attacks is important towards enhancing road safety, it is challenging because VANET operates in outdoor environment (highly changeable road conditions and atmospheric phenomena), and encompasses volatile topology and high mobility of vehicles (traveling speed and directions). To overcome these challenges, in this work, we study jamming attack mobility and behaviors in IEEE802.11p networks. In particular, we focus on analyzing jamming impact based on jammers behaviors, and mobility patterns. Thus, in order to achieve reliable detection, first we identify the impact of vehicles' density on network performance. Then, we study jamming effectiveness when adopting different mobility patterns (stationary, random, or targeting) and behaviors (constant, random, and reactive). Finally, we propose a two phase detection algorithm and evaluate it in a simulation environment. Our approach shows promising results to detect different types of jammers accurately in IEEE802.11p networks.	0.2
The number of metagenomic studies conducted each year is growing dramatically. Storage and analysis of such big data is difficult and time-consuming. Interestingly, analysis shows that environmental and human metagenomes include a significant amount of non-annotated sequences, representing a 'dark matter.' We established a bioinformatics pipeline that automatically detects metagenome reads matching query sequences from a given set and applied this tool to the detection of sequences matching large and giant DNA viral members of the proposed order Megavirales or virophages. A total of 1,045 environmental and human metagenomes (approximate to Terabase) were collected, processed, and stored on our bioinformatics server. In addition, nucleotide and protein sequences from 93 Megavirales representatives, including 19 giant viruses of amoeba, and 5 virophages, were collected. The pipeline was generated by scripts written in Python language and entitled MG-Digger. Metagenomes previously found to contain megavirus-like sequences were tested as controls. MG-Digger was able to annotate 100s of metagenome sequences as best matching those of giant viruses. These sequences were most often found to be similar to phycodnavirus or mimivirus sequences, but included reads related to recently available pandoraviruses, Pithovirus sibericum, and faustoviruses. Compared to other tools, MG-Digger combined stand-alone use on Linux or Windows operating systems through a user-friendly interface, implementation of ready-to-use customized metagenome databases and query sequence databases, adjustable parameters for BLAST searches, and creation of output files containing selected reads with best match identification. Compared to Metavir 2, a reference tool in viral metagenome analysis. MG-Digger detected 8% more true positive Megavirales-related reads in a control metagenome. The present work shows that massive, automated and recurrent analyses of metagenomes are effective in improving knowledge about the presence and prevalence of giant viruses in the environment and the human body.	0.4
First impressions of social traits, such as trustworthiness or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces, and despite their questionable validity they can have considerable real-world consequences. We sought to uncover the information driving such judgments, using an attribute-based approach. Attributes (physical facial features) were objectively measured from feature positions and colors in a database of highly variable ambient face photographs, and then used as input for a neural network to model factor dimensions (approachability, youthful-attractiveness, and dominance) thought to underlie social attributions. A linear model based on this approach was able to account for 58% of the variance in raters' impressions of previously unseen faces, and factor-attribute correlations could be used to rank attributes by their importance to each factor. Reversing this process, neural networks were then used to predict facial attributes and corresponding image properties from specific combinations of factor scores. In this way, the factors driving social trait impressions could be visualized as a series of computer-generated cartoon face-like images, depicting how attributes change along each dimension. This study shows that despite enormous variation in ambient images of faces, a substantial proportion of the variance in first impressions can be accounted for through linear changes in objectively defined features.	2.2
This paper describes the whole procedures to determine ice-induced global loads on the ship using measured full-scale data in accordance with the method proposed by the Canadian Hydraulics Centre of the National Research Council of Canada. Ship motions of 6 degrees of freedom (dof) are found by processing the commercial sensor signals named Motion Pak II under the assumption of rigid body motion. Linear accelerations as well as angular rates were measured by Motion Pak II data. To eliminate the noise of the measured data and the staircase signals due to the resolution of the sensor, a band pass filter that passes frequencies between 0.001 and 0.6 Hz and cubic spline interpolation resampling had been applied. 6 dof motions were computed by the integrating and/or differentiating the filtered signals. Added mass and damping force of the ship had been computed by the 3-dimensional panel method under the assumption of zero frequency. Once the coefficients of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic data as well as all the 6 dof motion data had been obtained, global ice loads can be computed by solving the fully coupled 6 dof equations of motion. Full-scale data were acquired while the ARAON rammed old ice floes in the high Arctic. Estimated ice impact forces for two representative events showed 7-15 MN when ship operated in heavy ice conditions.

Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) have been widely used as a hydraulic barrier along with HDPE geomembrane (GM) in landfills. Both the internal and interface strengths of GCLs are very important for evaluating landfill stability. An improved simple shear apparatus used in this study does not force the shear failure to occur along a pre-determined plane. The composite specimens can fail along any interface or through shearing of the GCL internally. The displacement of each component of the specimen can also be measured during the tests. When non-woven geotextile side contacts textured GM (NWGT/GMX) and woven geotextile side contacts compacted clay layer (WGT/CCL) for a dry GCL, the failure interface can change from NWGT/GMX interface to WGT/CCL interface with the increases of the normal stresses. Conversely, when woven geotextile side contacts textured GM (WGT/GMX) and non-woven geotextile side contacts compacted clay layer (NWGT/CCL) for a dry GCL, the failure always occurs at the WGT/GMX interface for all applied normal stresses. The internal failure of the GCL did not occur when the normal stress increased up to 1,500 kPa for the GCL in dry condition.	4.1
Introduction: Most disseminated cancers remain fatal despite the availability of a variety of conventional and novel treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and biologically targeted therapy. A major factor responsible for the failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer is the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). The overexpression of various ABC transporters in cancer cells can efficiently remove the anticancer drug from the cell, thus causing the drug to lose its effect.Areas covered: In this review, we summarised the ongoing research related to the mechanism, function, and regulation of ABC transporters. We integrated our current knowledge at different levels from molecular biology to clinical trials. We also discussed potential therapeutic strategies of targeting ABC transporters to reverse MDR in cancer cells.Expert opinion: Involvement of various ABC transporters to cancer MDR lays the foundation for developing tailored therapies that can overcome MDR. An ideal MDR reversal agent should have broad-spectrum ABC-transporter inhibitory activity, be potent, have good pharmacokinetics, have no trans-stimulation effects, and have low or no toxicity. Alternatively, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems containing both the cytotoxic drug and reversing agent may represent a useful approach to reversing MDR with minimal off-target toxicity.	6.0
In order to more fully understand the specific hydrodynamic relationship between young wind-generated gravity-capillary waves and longer gravity waves, a laboratory experiment was devised to observe changes in short wave spectral behavior over the phase of a long wave. This paper endeavors to expand on the body of laboratory wave modulation data and extend the investigation in support of the radar remote sensing of ocean surface waves. Measurements were made in the University of Miami's surge-structure-atmosphere interaction facility in the air-sea interaction saltwater tank wind-wave tank, with 10 m referenced wind speeds ranging between 5 and 23 m/s and paddle-generated wave steepnesses ak varying between 0.05 < ak < 0.3. A polarimetric camera was used to capture high sampling frequency maps of wave slope, yielding spatiotemporal information about short wind-wave behavior [provided as temporal variations in the wavenumber spectrum, where k approximate to (sic)(100-1000) rad/m]. The simultaneous and colocated long wave phase was measured via a side-looking camera. Hydrodynamic modulation transfer function (MTF) phases are found to be in general agreement with established values (between 2 and 10 radians) at the given wind speeds. The positive phase of the modulation places it immediately downwind of the long wave crest, with MTF magnitudes strongest for high wavenumbers at the lowest wind speeds. The results are also presented to show the modulation of gravity-capillary and pure capillary waves as variations in mean square slope over the long wave phase, with peak roughness enhancement found to move upwind of the long wave crest with increasing wind forcing.	4.2
We present here a vision of individualized Knowledge Graphs (iKGs) in cardiovascular medicine: a modern informatics platform of exchange and inquiry that comprehensively integrates biological knowledge with medical histories and health outcomes of individual patients. We envision that this could transform how clinicians and scientists together discover, communicate, and apply new knowledge.	0.1
The purpose of this study was to evaluate choroidal thickness (CT) in patients with psoriasis using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) and to determine its relationship with psoriasis activity indices. In this prospective study, EDI-OCT images were obtained in consecutive patients with psoriasis and in age-gender-matched healthy individuals. Comprehensive ophthalmic examination and EDI-OCT evaluation were performed. CT was measured in the subfoveal area. Correlation analyses were performed to identify the relationship of the CT with disease duration and clinical disease activity score. In total, 65 individuals were evaluated in this study, 35 with psoriasis and 30 controls. The mean disease duration of the patients with psoriasis was 15.7 +/- 8.8 years (0.3-34 years). There was no difference between groups with respect to age and gender (p = 0.695 and p = 0.628, respectively). Five of the 35 patients with psoriasis had anterior uveitis. None of the patients with psoriasis had signs of posterior uveitis. CT was significantly higher in the psoriasis group than that of control subjects (p < 0.001). The mean central foveal thickness was comparable between groups (p = 0.672). There was also no significant correlation between EDI-OCT, disease activity score, and disease duration (p < 0.05). Choroidal thickness is increased in psoriasis patients. Large serial and comparative studies are necessary to evaluate EDI-OCT, an examination that may be helpful in understanding the effects of psoriasis on the eye and its pathophysiology.	5.3
There is an urgent requirement to examine the quality of harvested rainwater for potable and non-potable purposes, based on the type of roofing material. In this study, we examined the effect on the quality of harvested rainwater of conventional roofing materials (concrete, asphalt and ceramic tile roofs) compared with alternative roofing materials (green roof). The results showed that the ceramic tile roof was the most suitable for rainwater-harvesting applications because of the lower concentrations of leachable pollutants. However, in this study, the green roof was not suitable for rainwater harvesting applications. In addition, seasonal trends in water quality parameters showed that pollutants in roof runoff in summer and autumn were lower than those in winter and spring. This study revealed that the quality of harvested rainwater was significantly affected by the roofing material; therefore, local government and urban planners should develop stricter testing programs and produce more weathering resistant roofing materials to allow the harvesting of rainwater for domestic and public uses.

This paper presents a decentralized control method for distributed generations (DGs) in an islanded direct current (DC) microgrid. In most typical DC microgrids, a decentralized control method is based on a voltage droop control method. However, the grid voltage differs from node to node due to line voltage drop, and hence the power sharing ratio among DGs cannot be matched with as desired value. Especially in an islanded DC microgrid including an energy storage system as a voltage source, it is difficult for DGs to maintain the charge state of the ESS in a decentralized way. To overcome this problem, state of charge (SOC)-voltage droop control is applied to the ESS. By using the proposed droop method, the SOC information can be assigned to the grid voltage, and hence the other DGs are able to support the SOC in a decentralized way. For DGs to enhance the accuracy of the SOC estimation, voltage drop is compensated for based on forecasting data and line impedance data. The simulation is modeled and implemented using Power System Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients for DC (PSCAD/EMTDC, version 4.2, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) and the simulation results show that the capability to maintain SOC as well as the system voltage profile are improved by using the proposed method.	3.0
Participants were asked to assess their own personality (i.e. Big Five scales), the personality of politicians shown in brief silent video clips, and the probability that they would vote for these politicians. Response surface analyses (RSA) revealed noteworthy effects of self-ratings and observer-ratings of openness, agreeableness, and emotional stability on voting probability. Furthermore, the participants perceived themselves as being more open, more agreeable, more emotionally stable, and more extraverted than the average politician. The study supports previous findings that first impressions affect decision making on important issues. Results also indicate that when only nonverbal information is available people prefer political candidates they perceive as having personality traits they value in themselves. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Secret sharing schemes divide a secret among multiple participants so that only authorized subsets of parties can reconstruct it. We show that secretly embedded trapdoor with universal protection attack can be embedded in secret sharing schemes that employ enough randomness to give the attacker an overwhelming advantage to access the secret. In case of ideal schemes, a coalition of a few participants (within at least one is the attacker) can succeed the attack, while in case of non-ideal schemes, the attacker's knowledge can be enough to reveal the secret. We exemplify the attack against Shamir's threshold scheme, which is the most well known and used secret sharing scheme. Finally, we consider some prevention techniques against the proposed attack.

ObjectiveElectrical stimulation via implanted electrodes that overlie the cortex of the brain is an upcoming neurosurgical technique that was hindered for a long time by insufficient knowledge of how the brain functions in a dynamic, physiological, and pathological way, as well as by technological limitations of the implantable stimulation devices. MethodsThis paper provides an overview of cortex stimulation via implantable devices and introduces future possibilities to improve cortex stimulation. ResultsCortex stimulation was initially used preoperatively as a technique to localize functions in the brain and only later evolved into a treatment technique. It was first used for pain, but more recently a multitude of pathologies are being targeted by cortex stimulation. These disorders are being treated by stimulating different cortical areas of the brain. Risks and complications are essentially similar to those related to deep brain stimulation and predominantly include haemorrhage, seizures, infection, and hardware failures. For cortex stimulation to fully mature, further technological development is required to predict its outcomes and improve stimulation designs. This includes the development of network science-based functional connectivity approaches, genetic analyses, development of navigated high definition transcranial alternating current stimulation, and development of pseudorandom stimulation designs for preventing habituation. ConclusionIn conclusion, cortex stimulation is a nascent but very promising approach to treating a variety of diseases, but requires further technological development for predicting outcomes, such as network science based functional connectivity approaches, genetic analyses, development of navigated transcranial electrical stimulation, and development of pseudorandom stimulation designs for preventing habituation.	5.0
The authors examined the role of sympathy and moral respect in children's overt aggression, and the subtypes of proactive and reactive aggression, in an ethnically diverse sample of 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds (N = 110). Aggressive behaviors were measured through teacher reports and peer nominations. Sympathy was assessed through teacher reports. Children reported on their moral respect within an interview procedure where they were asked for their feelings of respect toward hypothetical peers who displayed morally relevant behaviors. Results revealed that sympathy and moral respect were both negatively related to overt aggression and to the proactive aggression subtype, but unrelated to the reactive aggression subtype. The authors discuss the implications of the findings in relation to developmental research on the affective antecedents of children's aggressive behavior.	2.4
Finite element mesh generators exist in the public domain, a few even based on a parametric device description. The typical mesh generator requires some man-machine interaction to define the points and boundary conditions, and does not work for non-stop optimization iterations for which we need a mesh dynamically evolving through the iterations with optimization variables as changing parameters. Such mesh generators as do exist are rare, commercial, and not easily available to researchers except at great cost and never with the code to modify them to suit individual needs. We take a regular open source mesh generator and write a script-based interface as open source to run non-stop for optimization. We then use it to create a non-destructive evaluation system for army ground vehicles' defect characterization and use it equally for machine design. A simple scheme of averaging neighbour heights gives us a smooth geometry without having to use Bezier curves. The mesh runs on the central processing unit but finite element optimization is on the graphics processing unit for speed and practicable testing times.	3.3
We performed oxygen plasma treatment on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to improve its surface reactivity with respect to biomolecular interactions. Oxygen-plasma-treated rGO surfaces were employed as reactive interfaces for the detection of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the target analytes. By measuring the changes in electrical characteristics and confirmation through topographic analysis, the oxygen-plasma-treated rGO sensors had enhanced surface functionality for better antibody immobilization and sensing performance, with a 3.33-fold steeper slope for the electrical responses versus analyte concentration curve (logarithmic scale) compared to the untreated. The elicited biomolecular reactivity of the rGO surfaces with the oxygen plasma treatment remained at 46-51% of the initial value even after aging for 6 h in ambient conditions. This phenomenon was also confirmed by pretreating the rGO surfaces with a blocking agent and subsequently subjecting them to antibody immobilization. Finally, the feasibility of the oxygen-plasma-treated rGO sensors as a diagnostic tool was evaluated with clinical samples of neural-derived exosomal A beta peptides extracted from apparent AD patients and normal controls (NC). In contrast to the untreated sensors (p=0.0460), the oxygen-plasma-treated rGO sensors showed a significant p-value in the identification of clinical samples of AD and NC subjects (p < 0.001). These results suggest that oxygen plasma treatment improves sensor performance without complicated fabrication procedures and should aid in the development of novel diagnostic tools based on carbon nanomaterials.	5.2
This paper describes an experimental investigation of the load-settlement behaviour of a model strip footing resting on a reinforced homogeneous sand bed for several embedment depths at medium-dense to very dense states of sand. The reinforcement is a single-layer woven geotextile layer without and with wraparound ends at a depth of 0.3B from the base of the footing of width B. A particular focus of this study is the effect of wraparound ends of the reinforcement on the load-bearing capacity. The experimental results of the study are compared with numerical findings from a finite-element analysis carried out using the Plaxis 2D software. The study shows there is a significant improvement in both the load-bearing capacity and the stiffness of the sand bed with increasing footing embedment depth as well as with the provision of wraparound ends of the reinforcement. The numerical results follow the experimental results closely for the lower settlement values. The results presented in graphical form in this paper can be used as general guidelines for practical conditions similar to those considered in the present study.	4.1

This system can be powered by green energy resources such as solar energy or wind power and combined with digital control and wireless communication technologies it can achieve collection of a large amount of parameters in terms of modern agricultural cultivation, which will meet the needs of different application scenarios. Results of repeated experiments have shown that it has such advantages as being green and environmentfriendly, flexible and reliable.	1.4
A feasibility study was performed in order to demonstrate the benefits of designing and manufacturing a customized foot orthosis by means of digital technologies, such as Reverse Engineering (RE), Generative Design (GD) and Additive Manufacturing (AM). The aim of this work was to define the complete design-manufacturing process, starting from the 3D scanning of the human foot anatomy to the direct fabricating of the customized foot orthosis. Moreover, this first methodological study tries to combine a user-friendly semi-automatic modelling approach with the use of low-cost devices for the 3D laser scanning and the 3D printing processes. Finally, the result of this approach, based on digital technologies, was also compared with that achieved by means of conventional manual techniques.	3.0
This paper presents a procedure to include different cost scenarios of raw materials into the design of electric machines. The ratio between performance and material cost is visualized over a number of different cost scenarios. It is thereby possible to see not only if a specific design is competitive under the current market circumstances, but also to compare the sensitiveness for fluctuations in the material prices.	3.3
Verbal or nonverbal communication is one of the most important factors of socialization. Therefore teachers should place great emphasis on its development from the earliest age. Taking into account that playing is the main activity in kindergarden, most of our teaching activities should be linked with playing, with interesting games which are meant to raise the children's interest in what teacher has to say or wants to do in class. Game-based activities are common in teaching communication and language developing. Children learn easier, remember newly-taught words and use them spontaneously and creatively, also try to communicate more fluently and clearly. These games develop their imagination and creativity. This paper aims to present an experiment and the results obtained on a sample of 25 preschool for a period of 8 weeks were subjected to game - based activities aimed at developing their language and communication. Parallel results are presented and the control group, results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the program designed and implemented by us.	2.3
Galactose metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is carried out by a specialized GAL pathway consisting of structural and regulatory proteins. It is known that cells with unbalanced Gal proteins accumulate toxic metabolic intermediates and exhibit severe growth defects. Recently, we found that the molecular chaperone Hsp90 controls the abundance of multiple Gal proteins, possibly to prevent these defects. Hsp90 regulates various cellular processes including cell morphology in response to environmental cues. Yeast cells are known to resort to filamentous growth upon exposure to galactose or other environmental stresses. Our previous and current findings support the Hsp90 titration model of Hsp90 buffering, which links the cell morphology and galactose pathways. Our results suggest that, when a large proportion of Hsp90 molecules are used to help Gal proteins, the Hsp90 client proteins in cell morphology pathways are left unattended, leading to filamentous growth. It remains unclear whether this phenomenon serves any biological function or simply reflects a cellular constraint. Nonetheless, it provides an alternative explanation why the GAL pathway is degenerated in some yeast species.	6.0
Mineralization of sulfidic minerals including realgar, orpiment and pyrite occurs in argillic alteration zones in northeastern Iran, which affects water quality and health in these semi-arid localities. Geochemical source of ions in surface and ground waters was examined to evaluate potential effects of sulfidic mineralization on water quality. The surface and groundwater samples were analyzed to determine the major ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-) and trace elements (such as As, B, Br). Water-rock interactions and evaporation defined as the key phenomena on groundwater chemistry using Gibbs diagram. Concentrations of arsenic (As) varied from 16 to 606 mu g/L, which was higher than the WHO (2011). Calculated ionic ratios revealed that anions and cations in surface and ground waters originated from partial leaching through ion exchange in alteration zones. We postulate that the primary source of As resulted from oxidation of As-bearing sulfide minerals such as orpiment, realgar and arsenopyrite in argillic-pyrite alteration zone. High pH (>8) could provide the alkalinity to increase sulfide oxidation and release As into the water. The stable isotope data (delta O-18 and delta H-2) indicated the origin of the waters, which is mainly meteoric precipitation with partial effects from evaporation processes and exchanging ions with surrounding rocks. This confirms the notion that the source of all analyzed ions including the toxic As is geogenic. Hydrogeochemical process, which affected the water chemistry and thus environmental public health are likely to be water-rock interactions and evaporation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Proverbs are folkloric products with important references to cultural codes, behavioral patterns, suppositions related to various issues, and imagination of a society. These products may relate to countless topics from the notions of social life, up- to approaches to education and social gender issues, from otherization tendencies to paradigms for governance and applications of authority. A particular topic among them is the phenomenon of communication and communication acts. Therefore, proverbs can be scanned for clues explaining communication phenomena, socially approved and proposed. communication acts. Starting from this presupposition, the essential aim of the study is the communicational phenomena in Turkish proverbs and to explore explicit and/or hidden messaging related to communicational acts. In this sense, this study is a significant contribution to the formation of a map of comMunicational semantics of the Turkish society. In this respect, we browsed the proverbs and idioms dictionary of The Turkish Language Association for certain words and conducted thematic analysis of the 77 proverbs that were found in this relation. We found that while many proverbs exerted the importance of verbal communication in relation to the attributes of the utterance and it's implications; many other proverbs exhibited a rhetoric that affirmed nonverbal communication acts like silence, listening, and reticence. On the other hand, proverbs on visual communication featured messages that proposed that people should not be judged over their appearance and dressing.	2.3
The nearctic moth Acontia candefacta (Lepidoptera Noctuidae) is expanding its range in Europe. The species is considered a successful agent for biological control of Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asterales Asteraceae), a weed whose pollen causes allergies in humans. A few additional findings of the moth have been recorded at several new sites in southeastern Europe (Serbia) using light trapping. We here present and discuss the current distribution of the moth in Europe and the paths of its spreading on the basis of GIS data. GIS technology was used to map the distribution and quantify values of environmental variables within the range of the analysed moth species. Additionally, the potential colonization of the moth across Europe is modelled on the basis of its current distribution, environmental variables and the host plant's distribution.	5.1
Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic metals and is widely distributed in freshwater and marine environments. It has received much attention from a toxicological perspective. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Cd in the peacock blenny Salaria pavo, a species of the family of blennies that was used as bioindicator of water pollution. We performed a sublethal contamination of fish to 2 mg CdCl2 L-1 during 1, 4, 10, and 15 days. Cd accumulation was measured in gills and liver and displayed a significant increase of its concentration throughout the experiment, with slightly higher levels in the liver, except after 4 days. Partial-length cDNA of mt1, mt2, mnsod, cuznsod, cat, and gpx were characterized. Results from mRNA expression levels displayed an up-regulation of mt2 and mnsod. Biomarker activities were determined in gills and liver. In gills, data displayed an inhibition of EROD and GST activities. Cd exposure significantly increased GPx activities but did not affect CAT levels throughout the experiment. No LPO induction was observed in gills of exposed fish. Regarding the liver, the activity of all enzymes and MDA levels increased significantly from the beginning of the experiment except EROD that increased after 15 days of contamination only. At the histological level, fish exhibited pathological symptoms in gills and liver with a predominance of circulatory disturbances in gills and regressive changes in the liver. Our results displayed that peacock blennies are able to survive Cd toxicity due to various physiological adaptation mechanisms.	4.4
Objective. NSAIDs are first-line therapy in axial SpA (axSpA). The proportion of patients responding to NSAIDs and differences between AS and non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in this regard have not been studied in detail to date. The aim of this study was to examine the proportion of patients with AS and nr-axSpA responding to NSAIDs according to current treatment recommendations. Methods. Consecutive anti-TNF-naive patients with nr-axSpA and AS (n = 50 each) were included if their BASDAI score was 54 without having received maximal NSAID doses. In case of a BASDAI score 54 1 week later, another NSAID was prescribed. For the next 3 weeks, continuous intake of maximal doses was recommended but patients could reduce doses in case of intolerance or improvement. MRI of the SI joints was performed at baseline and week 4. Results. All outcomes except for CRP and MRI scores improved significantly after 4 weeks of NSAIDs, with no difference between axSpA subgroups. An Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society 40% (ASAS40) response and partial remission rates were 35 and 16% at week 4, respectively. At the same time point, a BASDAI score >= 4 was still present in 44% of patients, 30% of which had reduced NSAID doses, partly due to intolerance (38%). Only 13% of all patients had continuously taken NSAIDs at the maximal dosage, but there was no difference in the efficacy outcome compared with those who had taken reduced doses. Conclusion. AS and nr-axSpA patients had similar response rates to NSAIDs while objective signs of inflammation did not change over 4 weeks. Only a minority of patients was willing to take maximal doses of NSAIDs, and >= 40% patients remained candidates for TNF blockers. These results may influence future trial designs.	5.3
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a pervasive neurodevelopmental disease characterized by deficits in social interaction and nonverbal communication, as well as restricted interests and stereotypical behavior. Genetic changes/heritability is one of the major contributing factors, and hundreds to thousands of causative and susceptible genes, copy number variants (CNVs), linkage regions, and microRNAs have been associated with ASD which clearly indicates that ASD is a complex genetic disorder. Here, we will briefly summarize some of the high-confidence genetic changes in ASD and their possible roles in their pathogenesis.	2.3
Objectives: This study addressed: (a) Do professors' race/ethnicity and the race-related inequity information they present influence students' evaluations of the professors, acknowledgment of racial inequity, or motivation to respond without prejudice (MRWP)? (b) Do collective guilt and students' evaluations of professors mediate these relationships? Method: White American undergraduate students (N = 614, 66.3% females, 64.7% first year, mean age of 19.3 years [age SD = 1.5]) completed an anonymous online survey. Students imagined they were taking a racial diversity course with either a Black or a White male professor who presented either White privilege or Black disadvantage statements. Participants then completed surveys that assessed their evaluations of the professor, collective guilt, beliefs regarding racial inequity, and MRWP. Results: Students evaluated White professors as having lower expertise, learning conduciveness, and warmth/intelligence but rated Black professors as more biased. Consistent with the inequality-framing model, intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE), and findings from prejudice confrontation research, White professors induced greater acknowledgment of racial inequity when they discussed White privilege rather than Black disadvantage. But, Black professors induced more external MRWP when they presented White privilege rather than Black disadvantage. Students' perceptions of the professors' warmth/intelligence determined the effectiveness of the inequity message while perceptions of the professors' expertise, judgmental, and conduciveness to learning determined students' concerns about appearing prejudiced. Conclusions: The presenters' race/ethnicity and how they frame racial inequity information affect students' evaluation of the presenters, the message effectiveness, and students' external MRWP.	2.0
PurposeAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) including medication allergies are not well-described among large national cohorts. This study described the most common documented medication allergies and their reactions among a national cohort of Veterans Affairs (VA) inpatients. MethodsWe evaluated inpatient admissions in any VA Medical Center from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2014. Each admission was linked with allergy history preceding or upon admission. Individual drugs were aggregated into drug class category including: penicillins, sulfonamides, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, opiates, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory inhibitors (NSAID). Results were reported in aggregate and over time. ResultsApproximately 10.8 million inpatient admissions occurred from 2000 to 2014. We found the most commonly reported allergy drug classes were penicillins (13%, n=1410080), opiates (9.1%, n=984978), ACE inhibitors (5.7%, n=618075) sulfonamides (5.1%, n=558653), NSAIDs (5.1%, n=551216) and statins (3.6%, n=391983). Several allergy histories increased over time including opiates (6.2 to 11.2%), ACE inhibitors (1.3 to 10.2%), statins (0.3 to 7.3%) and NSAIDs (3.9 to 6.0%). Rash was the most commonly documented reaction on reports for penicillins (25.5%, n=371825), sulfonamides (25.6%, n=165954) and NSAIDs (10.3%, n=65741). The most common reaction for opiates was nausea/vomiting (17.9%, n=211864), cough/coughing for ACE inhibitors (41.0%, n=270537) and muscle pain/myalgia for statins (34.1%, n=186565). ConclusionsWe report that penicillins and opiates are the most commonly documented drug allergies among VA inpatients, but other drug classes such as ACE inhibitors, statins and NSAIDs are becoming increasingly common. Clinicians also commonly document non-allergic ADRs in the allergy section such as cough or myalgia. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	5.1
Bracken fern is an invasive plant that presents serious environmental, ecological and economic problems around the world. An understanding of the spatial distribution of bracken fern weeds is therefore essential for providing appropriate management strategies at both local and regional scales. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the freely available medium resolution Landsat 8 OLI sensor in the detection and mapping of bracken fern at the Cathedral Peak, South Africa. To achieve this objective, the results obtained from Landsat 8 OLI were compared with those derived using the costly, high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery. Since previous studies have already Successfully mapped bracken fern using high spatial resolution WorldView-2 image, the comparison was done to investigate the magnitude of difference in accuracy between the two sensors in relation to their acquisition costs. To evaluate the performance of Landsat 8 OLI in discriminating bracken fern compared to that of Worldview-2, we tested the utility of (i) spectral bands; (ii) derived vegetation indices as well as (iii) the combinatidn of spectral bands and vegetation indices based on discriminant analysis classification algorithm. After resampling the training and testing data and reclassifying several times (n =100) based on the combined data sets, the overall accuracies for both Landsat 8 and WorldView-2 were tested for significant differences based on Mann-Whitney U test. The results showed that the integration of the spectral bands and derived vegetation indices yielded the best overall classification accuracy (80.08% and 87.80% for Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 respectively). Additionally, the use of derived vegetation indices as a standalone data set produced the weakest overall accuracy results of 62.14% and 82.11% for both the Landsat 8 OLI and WorldView-2 images. There were significant differences {U (100) = 569.5, z = -10.8242, p < 0.01} between the classification accuracies derived based on Landsat OLI 8 and those derived using WorldView-2 sensor. Although there were significant differences between Landsat and WorldView-2 accuracies, the magnitude of variation (9%) between the two sensors was within an acceptable range. Therefore, the findings of this study demonstrated that the recently launched Landsat 8 OLI mtiltispectral sensor provides valuable information that could aid in the long term continuous monitoring and formulation of effective bracken fern management with acceptable accuracies that are comparable to those obtained from the high resolution WorldView-2 commercial sensor.

Continental-scale water quality modeling is a new scientific approach concerned with computing the level of water pollution for several river basins at once. Uncertainties in these models, and in models of smaller scale, arise especially from the specification of model parameters. To identify and analyze these uncertainties we perform a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling on the WorldQual water quality model. The focus of the analysis is the river pathogen model of WorldQual as applied to rivers in Africa. This is the first uncertainty and sensitivity analysis performed on a continental-scale pathogen river pollution model. The median output uncertainty of the model (coefficient of variation, based on log-transformed data), assuming plausible estimates of 42 parameter uncertainties, was 10.7%; 90% of grid cells had output uncertainties below 23%. The parameters making the largest contribution to this uncertainty (in order of importance) are the pathogen waste loading per capita, the in-stream settling velocity of pathogens, the percentage of population in a river basin connected to a sewer system, and the raw effluent concentration from the manufacturing sector. Over the continental study area, model output uncertainty and the most sensitive parameters were found to have a highly irregular spatial pattern. This finding suggests that model performance is a strong function of local and regional conditions and that reducing the uncertainty of a single parameter may not lead to large improvements in model performance over the entire continent. A more efficient approach would be to improve model performance region-by-region and improve the estimation of specific parameters known to have a large influence on model uncertainty in those regions. The analysis showed that only four parameters dominate output uncertainty over 93% of the study area, implying that model performance can be substantially improved by reducing the uncertainty of a small number of parameters.

CD36 gene encodes a membrane glycoprotein (type B scavenger receptor) present on the surface of many types of cells and having multiple cellular functions ranging from angiogenesis to gustatory perception of fatty acids. Using a case control genetic association approach we have analyzed selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) in a total of 859 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls and have identified the allele A in rs3211892 polymorphism of CD36 gene as significantly increasing the risk of AD. Additionally we have investigated, in the same sample of control subjects and patients, SNP's in ApoE gene and confirmed that the previously identified AD-associated SNP's indeed increased the risk and decreased the age of onset of AD as reported by others earlier. Based on the current knowledge of CD36 biochemistry we propose that the AD risk-imparting variants of CD36 alter cholesterol homeostasis, oxidation stress or induce pathological inflammatory cascades. The SNP rs3211892 has previously been associated with heart disease and other conditions but the present study is the first to identify a significant association between variations in CD36 gene and the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVES: Adiponectin is a novel plasma protein produced exclusively in adipocytes. Despite early data, its relationship with obesity and diabetes has been recently questioned. Since plasma lipids influence diabetes and obesity, of concern is whether any associations between plasma lipids and adiponectin exist. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to measure adiponectin levels and to investigate their associations with plasma cholesterol fractions and triglycerides in 73 obese non-diabetic subjects (44 women and 29 men), and 43 obese diabetic subjects (28 women and 15 men), aged 52.7 +/- 11.2 and 53.1 +/- 11 years, respectively, and matched for age, sex and BMI. The WHO definitions of obesity and diabetes were used. Adiponectin was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: No correlations between adiponectin and total and LDL cholesterol levels were shown (for the whole cohort: r=0.0130; p=0.8899, and r=0.0807; p=0.3958, respectively). A positive correlation between HDL cholesterol levels and adiponectin occured predominantly in obese women without diabetes (r=0.4531; p=0.0023), resulting in an overall statistical trend in the whole cohort (r=0.2243; p=0.0164). A negative correlation between serum adiponectin and triglycerides was found (r=-0.3413; p=0.0002). CONCLUSION: Adiponectin correlated only with TG and partially with HDL but not with LDL and total cholesterol in the study group of obese diabetic and obese non diabetic subjects. In view of these results we suggest that the role of adiponectin in human metabolism is unclear and merits further investigation.	6.2
A new compact scheme has been developed for any non-uniform grid. The compact scheme has been developed for spatial discretization and is analyzed here in conjunction with four-stage, fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) scheme for time integration while solving the one-dimensional convection equation. The space-time discretization combination is calibrated by subjecting the system to global spectral analysis (GSA) which was developed by the authors' group. Here, the compact scheme has been obtained by using a combination of two bi-diagonal schemes. The novel aspect of this scheme is its application in the physical plane directly without the necessity of mapping or transformations. Some typical cases for problems in acoustics, as well as fluid mechanics, have been studied here and potential use in large eddy simulations (LES) has been demonstrated by solving Navier-Stokes equation for lid driven cavity.

The developed approach enables a manufacturing engineering systems to make use of a comprehensive, flexible and consistent integration and to reduce the complexity of the applications being integrated. The main objective of the current study is to analyse ESB systems and integrate the data and activities considered with products, supply chain and shop-floor management processes.	3.2
This paper discusses the potential of water savings at property, household and urban levels, through the application of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs), as well as their quantification using the software Wise Water. Household centered measures are identified that allow for significant reduction of drinking water consumption with comparatively small effort, and without limitation of comfort. Furthermore, a method for the estimation of water recycling, for rainwater harvesting and for the utilization potential as locally available renewable freshwater is presented. Based on this study, the average drinking water consumption in urban households of industrialized countries could be reduced by approximately one third, without significant investment costs, either within the framework of new constructions or by the remodeling of water and sanitation systems in residential buildings. By using a secondary water quality, the drinking water demand could even be reduced by 50%. In the case of an area-wide application, the overall fresh water demand of cities and the exploitation of fresh water resources could be significantly reduced. Due to the comparability of the domestic water use of the investigated households, the findings are internationally transferable, for example to countries in Europe, Asia, and also the USA.	4.3
Studies in a variety of species have reported enhanced prosocial effects after an acute administration of the neuromodulating hormone, oxytocin (OT). Although the exact mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood, there is broad interest in developing OT into a treatment for social deficits. Only a few studies, however, have examined the effects of OT if given repeatedly during early development, the period when early intervention is likely to have the greatest benefits for reversing the progression towards social impairment. Those studies, exclusively in rodents, report mixed results. Some have shown enhancement of prosocial behavior, including increased social exploration, but others have shown antisocial effects, including increased aggression. In the present study, infant rhesus macaques were treated with a high-frequency (3 x per week) or low-frequency (1 x per week) dose of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) or placebo (IN-saline) between two and six months of age, after which their reactions to dynamic facial expressions (neutral, lipsmacking and threats) were measured. Results showed that IN-OT, compared to placebo, increased the time monkeys spent viewing the expression videos, but selectively reduced attention to the eyes in neutral faces in a dose dependent manner. The mechanism for this non-prosocial effect may be that repeated IN-OT administration down-regulates the expression of OT receptors in brain regions important for regulating social attention. Consequently, our results raise questions about the efficacy of implementing chronic IN-OT as a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of social deficits, particularly if given early in development. More work is needed, not only to identify optimal treatment schedules, but also to understand how IN-OT exerts its influences on the brain and behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a novel dual-consequent-pole Vernier memory machine (DCP-VMM) featuring alternatively arranged NdFeB and low coercive-force (LCF) magnet poles on the rotating and stationary sides, respectively. Due to the presence of LCF magnets that can be repetitively magnetized or demagnetized via a simple current pulse, the extra-high torque density at low-speed, and excellent high-efficient high-speed flux-weakening performance can be simultaneously realized. The configuration and operating principle, as well as the design considerations of the proposed machine are introduced, respectively. The finite element method (FEM) coupled with a nonlinear analytical hysteresis model for LCF magnets is employed to investigate the electromagnetic performance of the machine, which verifies the effectiveness of machine design and the feasibility as a competent candidate for automotive applications.	3.3
Giardia duodenalis is a flagellated intestinal protozoan responsible for infections in various hosts including humans and several wild and domestic animals. Few studies have correlated environmental contamination and clinical infections in the same region. The aim of this study was to compare groups of Giardia duodenalis from clinical and environmental sources through population genetic analyses to verify haplotype sharing and the degree of genetic similarity among populations from clinical and environmental sources in the metropolitan region of Campinas. The results showed high diversity of haplotypes and substantial genetic similarity between clinical and environmental groups of G.duodenalis. We demonstrated sharing of Giardia genotypes among the different populations studied. The comparison between veterinary and human sequences led us to identify new zoonotic genotypes, including human isolates from genetic assemblage C. The application of a population genetic analysis in epidemiological studies allows quantification of the degree of genetic similarity among populations of Giardia duodenalis from different sources of contamination. The genetic similarity of Giardia isolates among human, veterinary, and environmental groups reinforced the correlation between clinical and environmental isolates in this region, which is of great importance for public health.	6.4
Computerized obstructive sleep apnea detection is necessary to speed-up sleep apnea diagnosis and research and for assisting medical professionals. Moreover, the development of a device to monitor sleep apnea that is low-power and portable, requires a reliable and successful sleep apnea detection scheme. In this article, the problem of automated sleep apnea detection using singe-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been addressed. At first, segments of ECG signals are decomposed using a data-adaptive signal decomposition scheme, namely- tunable-Q factor wavelet transform (TQWT). Three statistical features are extracted from the TQWT sub-bands and train and test matrices are formed afterwards. These matrices are fed into the classifier to identify non-apneic and apneic ECG signal segments. In this work, a new machine learning algorithm, namely random under sampling boosting (RUSBoost) is implemented to perform classification. This is for the first time TQWT along with RUSBoost is employed for automatic sleep apnea detection to our knowledge. The overall algorithmic performance of our method is inspected for various values of TQWT parameters. Optimal values of these parameters are investigated and determined. The efficacy and appropriateness of RUSBoost are demonstrated as opposed to the commonly used classification models. The algorithmic performance of our sleep apnea identification scheme is also evaluated against existing detection algorithms in the literature. Experimental outcomes manifest that our sleep apnea identification scheme performs better than the existing works in sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. It can be anticipated that owing to its use of only one channel of ECG signal, the proposed method will be ideal for device implementation, eliminate the onus of clinicians of analyzing a large bulk of data manually, and expedite sleep apnea diagnosis.	0.1
In this paper, a new control structure is presented to extract maximum power from a wind regime. In this novel approach, a discrete-time higher order sliding-mode controller is designed as an observer to construct the reference value for the extractable power based on the condition that it operates. This is possible by tracking the optimal tip speed ratio with manipulating the voltages of the rotor in the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) configuration. The presented structure improves the performance under abrupt changes in the wind speed and can be used for any type of optimum active power tracking algorithms. The simulations show the significant improvement in performance of the nonlinear discrete-time backstepping controller utilizing this technique.	1.4
Local scour around seabed oil, gas or water pipelines can critically affect their stability. Accurate estimation of scour around pipelines is therefore a key topic of research for marine engineers. This paper presents results from a numerical study of clear-water scour depth below a submarine pipeline for a range of steady flow conditions. The flow field around a pipeline under scour equilibrium conditions was numerically simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the standard k-epsilon turbulence closure. The flow discharge through the scour hole for various flow conditions was then investigated, and the results were used to establish the relationship between the flow discharge and the maximum scour depth. By incorporating the Colebrook-White equation, the bed shear stress was obtained and an iterative method was developed to predict the scour depth around the pipeline. The calculated scour depths using the proposed method agreed well with laboratory measurements, with the average absolute relative error being smaller than that obtained by using previous methods. Therefore, this proposed method can be used to predict the clear-water scour around submarine pipelines with improved accuracy.	3.1
A study was conducted to determine the financial and environmental effects of water quality on rainwater harvesting systems. The potential for replacing tap water used in washing machines with rainwater was studied, and then analysis presented in this paper is valid for applications that include washing machines where tap water hardness may be important A wide range of weather conditions, such as rainfall (284-1794 mm/year); water hardness (14-315 mg/L CaCO3); tap water prices (0.85-2.65 Euros/m(3)) in different Spanish urban areas (from individual buildings to whole neighbourhoods); and other scenarios (including materials and water storage capacity) were analysed. Rainfall was essential for rainwater harvesting, but the tap water prices and the water hardness were the main factors for consideration in the financial and the environmental analyses, respectively. The local tap water hardness and prices can cause greater financial and environmental impacts than the type of material used for the water storage tank or the volume of the tank. The use of rainwater as a substitute for hard water in washing machines favours financial analysis. Although tap water hardness significantly affects the financial analysis, the greatest effect was found in the environmental analysis. When hard tap water needed to be replaced, it was found that a water price of 1 Euro/m(3) could render the use of rainwater financially feasible when using large-scale rainwater harvesting systems. When the water hardness was greater than 300 mg/L CaCO3, a financial analysis revealed that an net present value greater than 270 Euros/dwelling could be obtained at the neighbourhood scale, and there could be a reduction in the Global Warming Potential (100 years) ranging between 35 and 101 kg CO2 eq./dwelling/year.

Membrane transporters enable efficient cellular metabolism, aid in nutrient sensing, and have been associated with various diseases, such as obesity and cancer. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions capture genomic, physiological, and biochemical knowledge of a target organism, along with a detailed representation of the cellular metabolite transport mechanisms. Since the first reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon 1, published in 2007, progress has been made in the field of metabolite transport. Recently, we published an updated reconstruction, Recon 2, which significantly improved the metabolic coverage and functionality. Human metabolic reconstructions have been used to investigate the role of metabolism in disease and to predict biomarkers and drug targets. Given the importance of cellular transport systems in understanding human metabolism in health and disease, we analyzed the coverage of transport systems for various metabolite classes in Recon 2. We will review the current knowledge on transporters (i.e., their preferred substrates, transport mechanisms, metabolic relevance, and disease association for each metabolite class). We will assess missing coverage and propose modifications and additions through a transport module that is functional when combined with Recon 2. This information will be valuable for further refinements. These data will also provide starting points for further experiments by highlighting areas of incomplete knowledge. This review represents the first comprehensive overview of the transporters involved in central metabolism and their transport mechanisms, thus serving as a compendium of metabolite transporters specific for human metabolic reconstructions.	6.2
Palatogenesis requires a precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression, which is controlled by an intricate network of transcription factors and their corresponding DNA motifs. Even minor perturbations of this network may cause cleft palate, the most common congenital craniofacial defect in humans. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small regulatory non-coding RNAs, have elicited strong interest as key regulators of embryological development, and as etiological factors in disease. MiRNAs function as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression and are therefore able to fine-tune gene regulatory networks. Several miRNAs are already identified to be involved in congenital diseases. Recent evidence from research in zebrafish and mice indicates that miRNAs are key factors in both normal palatogenesis and cleft palate formation. Here, we provide an overview of recently identified molecular mechanisms underlying palatogenesis involving specific miRNAs, and discuss how dysregulation of these miRNAs may result in cleft palate.	6.4
Glutamate transporters (EAAT) have been implicated in the drug addiction behavior. We determined whether EAAT type 3 (EAAT3) played a role in morphine addiction. Six-to eight-week-old EAAT3 knockout (EAAT3(-/-)) mice and their wild-type littermates received 3 intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg morphine, each on an alternative day, to induce conditioned place preference (CPP). Two days after the place preference returned to baseline, mice received 2.5 mg/kg morphine to induce reinstatement. Some mice received intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg riluzole, an EAAT activator, 30 min before morphine or saline injection. Hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area were harvested for Western analysis 24 h after the last dose of morphine was injected. Morphine induced CPP in wild-type and EAAT3(-/-)mice. Gender is not a statistically significant factor to influence this behavior. This conditioned behavior extinguished after morphine administration was stopped for 8-9 days in wild-type mice, while this extinction occurred 6 days after discontinuation of morphine injection in EAAT3(-/-)mice. A small dose of morphine similarly reinstated the conditioned behavior in the wild-type and EAAT3(-/-)mice. Riluzole abolished morphine-induced CPP during the initial place preference. Morphine increased EAAT3 expression in the plasma membrane of medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area but did not affect EAAT3 expression in the hippocampus. These results suggest that EAAT3 delays the extinction of morphine-induced CPP. EAAT activation may prevent the formation of morphine-induced CPP. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Drill stem vibration may cause drilling inefficiencies and often leads to non-productive time. Drill stem vibration analysis is performed to prevent and identify RPM values that may cause damaging standing waves in the drill stem. However, different models and assumptions give different vibration results. One simplification commonly done is excluding drilling fluids. This paper investigates the effect of including drilling hydraulics and the dynamic pressure on drill stem vibrations. The model assumes the drill stem is acting as a Euler Bernoulli beam and was discretized using a finite element formulation. Two fluid rheological models, Herschel Bulkley and Power Law, were used to determine the uncoupled dynamic pressure drop across the drill stem. The results show that including the dynamic pressure in the drill stem vibration model causes the critical rotational speeds to change as much as 32% (i.e. 59 RPM). As expected, axial and torsional vibrations are not affected, while lateral vibration changes significantly when the ratio of the wellbore diameter to the drill stem outside diameter is below 1.25, with a narrow total drill bit flow area, or when operating at high flow rates. Therefore, when creating RPM road maps to avoid vibrations while drilling, the contribution of the dynamic pressure should be included. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.1
Dry eye is an increasingly common disease in modern society which affects a wide range of population and has a negative impact on their daily activities, such as working with computers or driving. It can be diagnosed through an automatic clinical test for tear film lipid layer classification based on color and texture analysis. Up to now, researchers have mainly focused on the improvement of the image analysis step. However, there is still large room for improvement on the machine learning side. This paper presents a methodology to optimize this problem by means of class binarization, feature selection, and classification. The methodology can be used as a baseline in other classification problems to provide several solutions and evaluate their performance using a set of representative metrics and decision-making methods. When several decision-making methods are used, they may offer disagreeing rankings that will be solved by conflict handling in which rankings are merged into a single one. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in this domain. Also, its general purpose allows to adapt it to other classification problems in different fields such as medicine and biology.	0.1
Freshwater resources scarcity is becoming a limiting factor for development and sustenance in most parts of Ethiopia. The Debre Mewi watershed, in northwest Ethiopia, is one of such areas where the need for supplemental water supply through rainwater harvesting is essential. Suitable water harvesting sites were identified through overlay analysis considering both social and technical parameters, such as land use/land cover, slope gradient, soil texture, flow accumulation and stakeholders' priority. This was performed with the integration of GIS and remote sensing applications. Knowledge of runoff resulting from rainfall is most important for designing any water harvesting structure. Direct field-level measurement of runoff is always good, but it is time consuming, labour intensive and expensive. In conditions where direct measurement of runoff could not be possible, remote sensing technology and GIS combined with runoff models are proven to be effective. In this study, the remotely sensed satellite data (Quickbird2) provided spatial information on land use/land cover. Precipitation was obtained from the nearest meteorological station, and soil data were acquired form laboratory analysis. The GIS tools were used to store, manipulate and estimate runoff depth, surface storage and runoff volume, applying Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Curve Number (CN) formula. The direct runoff volume estimated using SCS-CN model is 146,697 m(3) for the month of August, at Debre Mewi watershed, which covers about 508 ha. The result was compared with measured values, and closer relationship was found. This indicates that there is enough runoff water to be harvested for different uses. Remote sensing was found to be a very important tool in providing input parameters. GIS was also found to be a very important tool in mapping and integrating the different variables, in the process of runoff estimation and suitable water harvesting sites selection.	4.3
Flanders' Hilbert space or finite power theory of infinite networks was extended to 1-networks by Zemanian. A new approach uses approximation by finite networks, a-priori bounds from no-gain properties, and Arzela-Ascoli, in a continuous function space. This paper compares, contrasts and reconciles these existence and uniqueness theories.	1.3
1-Phenyl-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)octan-1-one (PV9) and 16 metabolites, including diastereomers and conjugates, were identified or tentatively detected in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. These urinary metabolites indicated that the metabolic pathways of PV9 include: (1) the reduction of ketone groups to their corresponding alcohols; (2) oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding pyrrolidone; (3) aliphatic oxidation of the terminal carbon atom to the corresponding carboxylate form, possibly through an alcohol intermediate (not detected); and (4) hydroxylation at the penultimate carbon atom to the corresponding alcohols followed by further oxidation to ketones, and combinations of these steps. In addition, results from the quantitative analyses of five phase-I metabolites using newly synthesized authentic standards suggested that the main metabolic pathway includes the aliphatic oxidation of terminal and/or penultimate carbons. Human metabolism of PV9 differed significantly from those of alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone and alpha-pyrrolidinobutiophenone, suggesting that the main metabolic pathways of alpha-pyrrolidinophenones significantly change depending on the alkyl chain length of the parent molecule.	6.2
The study examined third-party listeners' ability to detect the Hellos spoken to prevalidated happy, neutral, and sad facial expressions. The average detection accuracies from the happy and sad (HS), happy and neutral (HN), and sad and neutral (SN) listening tests followed the average vocal pitch differences between the two sets of Hellos in each of the tests; HS and HN detection accuracies were above chance reflecting the significant pitch differences between the respective Hellos. The SN detection accuracy was at chance reflecting the lack of pitch difference between sad and neutral Hellos. As expected, the SN detection accuracy positively correlated with theory of mind; participating in these tests has been likened to the act of eavesdropping, which has been discussed from an evolutionary perspective. An unexpected negative correlation between the HS detection accuracy and the empathy quotient has been discussed with respect to autism research on empathy and pitch discrimination.	2.1
As Chronic Kidney Disease progresses slowly, early detection and effective treatment are the only cure to reduce the mortality rate. Machine learning techniques are gaining significance in medical diagnosis because of their classification ability with high accuracy rates. The accuracy of classification algorithms depend on the use of correct feature selection algorithms to reduce the dimension of datasets. In this study, Support Vector Machine classification algorithm was used to diagnose Chronic Kidney Disease. To diagnose the Chronic Kidney Disease, two essential types of feature selection methods namely, wrapper and filter approaches were chosen to reduce the dimension of Chronic Kidney Disease dataset. In wrapper approach, classifier subset evaluator with greedy stepwise search engine and wrapper subset evaluator with the Best First search engine were used. In filter approach, correlation feature selection subset evaluator with greedy stepwise search engine and filtered subset evaluator with the Best First search engine were used. The results showed that the Support Vector Machine classifier by using filtered subset evaluator with the Best First search engine feature selection method has higher accuracy rate (98.5%) in the diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease compared to other selected methods.	0.1
The difficulty of retrieving the abutment screw is a major disadvantage of cement-retained implant restorations. Conventional methods for locating the screw-access hole are based largely on radiography or manual labor, which limits accuracy and clinical feasibility. This clinical report describes a non-radiological method for fabricating an accurate drilling guide for location of the screw channel using intraoral optical scanning, 3D superimposition, and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies. The present technique not only improves the guide fabrication process and the accuracy of screw-channel drilling, but also has wide indications for implant restorations.	3.0
Little is known about the role of flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) in the metabolism of xenobiotics. FMO3 is the isoform in adult human liver with the highest impact on drug metabolism. The aim of the presented study was to elucidate the contribution of human FMO3 to the N-oxygenation of selected therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse (DOAs). Its contribution to the in vivo hepatic net clearance of the N-oxygenation products was calculated by application of an extended relative activity factor (RAF) approach to differentiate from contribution of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. FMO3 and CYP substrates were identified using pooled human liver microsomes after heat inactivation and chemical inhibition, or single enzyme incubations. Kinetic parameters were subsequently determined using recombinant human enzymes and mass spectrometric analysis via authentic reference standards or simple peak areas of the products divided by those of the internal standard. FMO3 was identified as enzyme mainly responsible for the formation of N,N-diallyltryptamine N-oxide and methamphetamine hydroxylamine (>80% contribution for both). A contribution of 50 and 30% was calculated for the formation of N,N-dimethyltryptamine N-oxide and methoxypiperamide N-oxide, respectively. However, FMO3 contributed with less than 5% to the formation of 3-bromomethcathinone hydroxylamine, amitriptyline N-oxide, and clozapine N-oxide. There was no significant difference in the contributions when using calibrations with reference metabolite standards or peak area ratio calculations. The successful application of a modified RAF approach including FMO3 proved the importance of FMO3 in the N-oxygenation of DOAs in human metabolism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Research on language attitudes has shown that speech style plays an important role in social evaluation. In Croatia, English words commonly occur in everyday communication, which could affect the way we perceive other people. This study aims to investigate the relation between English words and person perception. 200 Croatian elementary school students, adolescents and young adults were given one of the three versions of the same text, varying in the frequency of English words, and a questionnaire to evaluate personal characteristics of the author of the text. The results showed that frequent use of English words was related to higher estimations of social attractiveness, indicating that the use of English words has become an important cue in person perception.

This paper will show the correlation between the shear tensile test and the direct shear test within the field of geosynthetic clay liners (Gas). It will be proven that the former may serve as a substitute for the latter, but only for the adhesion value. GCLs are clay mineral sealing layers widespread used. They can be used in waste and contaminated soil caps and closures, landfill base liners, gas and vapor seals, vertical barriers, etc. GCLs often have bentonite encased between two geotextile layers connected by fibers, either by needle-punching or stitch-bonding. The results from peel tests and shear box tests are currently used for establishing the internal shear failure of GCLs. This paper analyzes the mechanical shear behavior of needle-punched GCLs (NP GCLs) in a zero stress condition. On the one hand, a large direct shear test (ASTM 6243-09) on NP GCLs specimens was used to study its shear behavior, specifically, assessing the adhesion value. On the other hand, the shear tensile test, showed by Maubeuge and Ehrenberg (Maubeuge, K.P., Ehrenberg, H., 2000. Comparison of peel bond and shear tensile test methods for needle-punched geosynthetic clay liners. Geotextiles and Geomembranes 18(2-4), 203-214), was used to study the shear tensile strength. Comparing both test methods, an average shear tensile value of 32 kPa was obtained which is closer to the average adhesion value of 30 kPa. The dominant failure mechanisms are not depending on the test conditions (e.g. dry or hydrated conditions). However, it strongly depends on the type of carrier geotextiles and their connections.

In line with the trend toward continuous miniaturization and price reduction, it is crucial to analyze the impact of uncertainties on the performance of electrical circuits. Performance is evaluated for the worst-case scenario and in the frequency domain by computing upper and lower bounds. The purpose is not only to propose a method for the worst-case tolerance analysis but also to provide an efficient and a suitable tool for electrical engineers that can be easily applied to realistic electrical engineering problems. The proposed method is based on the robust analysis method (so-called mu-analysis) for which well known and efficient algorithms exist. However in order to apply it, the problem under consideration has to be transformed in a standard minimal so-called LFT representation. Its derivation is a difficult task even for control systems engineers. This paper proposes a transparent and systematic LFT derivation procedure for users based only on their knowledge of electrical engineering. At the end of this paper, an industrial example is provided, which reveals the benefits and the efficiency of the proposed approach, and how it can be applied to any linear electrical circuit.	1.2
Security is a major concern in all computing environments. One way to achieve security is to deploy a secure operating system (OS). A trusted OS can actually secure all the resources and can resist the vulnerabilities and attacks effectively. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we critically analyze the host vulnerabilities in modern desktop OSs. We group existing approaches and provide an easy and concise view of different security models adapted by most widely used OSs. The comparison of several OSs regarding structure, architecture, mode of working, and security models also form part of the paper. Secondly, we use the current usage statistics for Windows, Linux, and MAC OSs and predict their future. Our forecast will help the designers, developers and users of the different OSs to prepare for the upcoming years accordingly.	0.4
Large Wind Parks (WPs) are an essential priority, mainly in non-residential districts. Especially the offshore WPs, in areas with valuable energy potential, without legislation prohibits and without causing disturbance to the nearby community, could release enormous land for other uses (culture, recreation areas, tourism, etc.). The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for the sustainable siting of an offshore WP based on legal limitations, with a particular respect of ecological and economic resources using as example the island of Crete. It will also be considered the visual, acoustic and aesthetic disturbance of the coastal area residents and visitors and integrate them into the context. One of the essential issues that make the region unique is the undersea relief, which makes difficult the numerous and large-scale intervention, because some areas are strictly protected by the EU. Three steps have been followed: (i) exception of unsuitable areas (geological restrictions, visual and acoustical disturb and safety and of course due to environmental conditions); (ii) evaluation of environmental impacts on birdlife, Special Protection Areas and Sites of Community Importance; (iii) assessment of wind potential and needs of electricity in the regional unit of Chania, in the Western Crete.

Rheumatoid patients with injuries are treated by orthopaedic rheumatologists as well as trauma surgeons. Surgeons must take account of numerous factors that influence the treatment of this special patient population, e. g. immunosuppressive drugs, severe osteoporosis, atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous fat and muscles joint instability and arteriosclerosis. This requires knowledge in immunology, pharmacology and the entire spectrum of internal medicine, as well as special care in the treatment of vulnerable tissues. In polytrauma patients with inflammatory diseases, rheuma toid serositis may be misinterpreted with a lethal outcome. Because of the high lethality, vertebral fractures related to ankylosing spondylitis have to be treated very carefully. Instability of the cervical spine, especially the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints, is common in long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, and manipulation of the cervical spine may lead to cervical cord injury with respiratory arrest.	5.3
In 2012 the 36,5 km long section of the expressway S7 between the Polish villages Paslek and Milomlyn was completed. The road alignment partially crossed up to 11 m thick organic soil formations showing a consistency in the range of plastic to soft plastic. Therefore subsoil improvement measures such as unreinforced full displacement concrete piles and a geotextile reinforced embankment were designed by the owner. Despite the executed soil improvement measures only seven months after the release for traffic settlements up to 70 cm occurred along a 35 m long section of the expressway. Utilizing 2D Finite Element Method as well as comparative calculations using conventional methods a failure back analysis was conducted by Zentrale Technik - Technical Office Vienna. The article at hand focusses on the executed assessment of damage as well as on the results of the performed failure analyses and furthermore the elaborated restoring concepts and the restoring measure executed on site are presented.	4.1
Former studies suggest that the core features of psychopathy, namely the callous-unemotional (CU) traits are associated with emotional dysfunction characterized by atypical processing of other people's distress. Using a dimensional approach to CU traits, the current study aims to test neural activity during performance of a facial expression recognition task in a community sample of young adults. Forty-one participants (25 females, M age = 25.44, SD = 4.03) completed the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected to measure neural responses to fearful, happy and sad faces as compared with neutral facial expressions. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that during exposure to fearful face expressions, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses were negatively associated with CU traits in the right anterior cingulate gyms (ACCg), but not in the amygdala. These findings support that CU traits are related to a unique neural response to fearful faces in noncriminal population as well. It also highlights the importance of taking into account other regions outside the amygdala, in particular the ACC, when testing the relation between CU traits and fear response. 2017 The Authors.

Cell tracking plays crucial role in biomedical and computer vision areas. As cells generally have frequent deformation activities and small sizes in microscope image, tracking the non-rigid and non-significant cells is quite difficult in practice. Traditional visual tracking methods have good performances on tracking rigid and significant visual objects, however, they are not suitable for cell tracking problem. In this paper, a novel cell tracking method is proposed by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as well as multi-task learning (MTL) techniques. The CNNs learn robust cell features and MTL improves the generalization performance of the tracking. The proposed cell tracking method consists of a particle filter motion model, a multi-task learning observation model, and an optimized model update strategy. In the training procedure, the cell tracking is divided into an online tracking task and an accompanying classification task using the MTL technique. The observation model is trained by building a CNN to learn robust cell features. The tracking procedure is started by assigning the cell position in the first frame of a microscope image sequence. Then, the particle filter model is applied to produce a set of candidate bounding boxes in the subsequent frames. The trained observation model provides the confidence probabilities corresponding to all of the candidates and selects the candidate with the highest probability as the final prediction. Finally, an optimized model update strategy is proposed to enable the multi-task observation model for the variation of the tracked cell over the entire tracking procedure. The performance and robustness of the proposed method are analyzed by comparing with other commonly-used methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has good performance to the cell tracking problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.0
A numerical model is developed in the framework of OpenFOAM; an open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation code to simulate particle laden dense flows. The model uses discrete element method (DEM) for the discrete/particle phase and computational fluid dynamics approach (CFD) for the fluid/continuum phase. In current study, validation of the model is done in two steps. In first step the drag model is validated by comparing the results of settling velocity of spherical particle. In second step, spout fluidization test cases with different operating conditions are simulated and results of numerical simulation of spout-fluidized bed are compared against experimental and simulation results reported in literature. The isosurface plots of solid volume fraction show a good qualitative prediction of different flow regimes. The particle velocity profiles in the vertical direction for different test cases corresponding to different flow regimes are plotted and compared with the literature data. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with the experimental and numerical results reported in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	3.4
Mobility management has become a core function in internet services and networks as mobile devices have been widely used and their capabilities have dramatically advanced. It is expected that proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), which is the most prominent solution, will play an important role in supporting these devices' mobility. To protect PMIPv6 networks, several authentication schemes have been presented. However, due to their static approach, the existing schemes failed to keep a good balance between security and efficiency. Motivated by this, the authors study an adaptive authentication scheme for mobile devices in PMIPv6 networks. In particular, the proposed scheme considers mobile nodes' context information to decide authentication strength, based on which adaptive authentication is performed. It is shown from the formal security verification and the example study that the proposed scheme is not only correct, but also achieves a good trade-off between security and efficiency	0.2
Background: Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome results from bi-allelic inheritance of mutations affecting the key DNA mismatch repair genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2. Individuals with bi-allelic mutations have a dysfunctional mismatch repair system from birth; as a result, constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome is characterised by early onset malignancies. Fewer than 150 cases have been reported in the literature over the past 20 years. This is the first report of the founder PMS2 mutation - NM_000535.5: c.1500del (p.Val501TrpfsTer94) in exon 11 and its associated cancers in this family. Case presentation: The proband is 30 years old and is alive today. She is of Pakistani ethnic origin and a product of consanguinity. She initially presented aged 24 with painless bleeding per-rectum from colorectal polyps and was referred to clinical genetics. Clinical examination revealed two cafe-au-lait lesions, lichen planus, and a dermoid cyst. Her sister had been diagnosed in childhood with an aggressive brain tumour followed by colorectal cancer. During follow up, the proband developed 37 colorectal adenomatous polyps, synchronous ovarian and endometrial adenocarcinomas, and ultimately a metachronous gastric adenocarcinoma. DNA sequencing of peripheral lymphocytes revealed a bi-allelic inheritance of the PMS2 mutation NM_000535.5:c.1500del (p.Val501TrpfsTer94) in exon 11. Ovarian tumour tissue demonstrated low microsatellite instability. To date, she has had a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and a total gastrectomy. Aspirin and oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy provide some chemoprophylaxis and manage postmenopausal symptoms, respectively. An 18-monthly colonoscopy surveillance programme has led to the excision of three high-grade dysplastic colorectal tubular adenomatous polyps. The proband's family pedigree displays multiple relatives with cancers including a likely case of 'true' Turcot syndrome. Conclusions: Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome should be considered in patients who present with early onset cancer, a strong family history of cancer, and cutaneous features resembling neurofibromatosis type I. Immunohistochemistry analysis of tumour and normal tissue is sensitive and specific for identifying patients with mismatch repair deficiency and should direct DNA sequencing of lymphocytic tissue to establish a diagnosis. Microsatellite instability status appears to be of little value in identifying patients who may have constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome.	6.4
The primary aim was to determine the efficacy of the Distress Thermometer (DT) in screening for anxiety and mood problems against the University of Washington Quality of Life, version 4 (UWQOL). Secondary aims were to evaluate the association between demographic, clinical and health-related QOL variables with significant distress. Two hundred and sixty one disease-free HNC ambulatory patients attending routine follow-up clinics were prospectively recruited. Both DT and UWQOL were completed pre-consultation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses of DT score for anxiety dysfunction yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.877, with a sensitivity of 84% (43/51) and specificity of 76% (159/210) for a DT cut-off of ae4; with a corresponding AUC of 0.825 for mood with sensitivity 78% (28/36) and specificity 71% (159/225). Treatment with radiotherapy and a longer consultation time were associated with significant distress (DT ae4). Significant distress was also reported in two third of those reporting less than Good overall QOL. Distress levels were particularly associated with poor Social-Emotional function, more so than the association seen with poor physical function. DT is a reasonable screening tool for distress in the HNC population. The DT cut-off score ae4 was effective in identifying those with significant distress. Significant distress is associated in survivors with poor health-related quality of life, those who received radiotherapy and patients who have longer consultation times in clinic.	5.4
The cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is an assessable physicochemical property used to evaluate the microbial adhesion to the surface of biomaterials, which is an essential step in the microbial biofilm formation and pathogenesis. For the present in vitro fermentation experiment, the CSH of ruminal mixed microbes was considered, along with other data records of pH, ammonia-nitrogen concentration, and neutral detergent fibre digestibility, conditions of surface tension and specific surface area in two different time scales. A dataset of 170,707 perturbations of input variables, grouped into two blocks of data, was constructed. Next, Expected Measurement Moving Average - Machine Learning (EMMA-ML) models were developed in order to predict CSH after perturbations,of all input variables. EMMA-ML is a Perturbation Theory method that combines the ideas of Expected Measurement, Box Jenkins Operators/Moving Average, and Time Series Analysis. Seven regression methods have been tested: Multiple Linear regression, Generalized Linear Model with Stepwise Feature Selection, Partial Least Squares regression, Lasso regression, Elastic Net regression, Neural Networks regression, and Random Forests (RF). The best regression performance has been obtained with RF (EMMA-RF model) with an R-squared of 0.992. The model analysis has shown that CSH values were highly dependent on the in vitro fermentation parameters of detergent fibre digestibility, ammonia - nitrogen concentration, and the expected values of cell surface hydrophobicity in the first time scale.

Orexin-1 receptors (Ox1Rs) have been implicated in the motivation for drugs of abuse. Here, we utilized a within-session behavioral-economics threshold procedure to screen for individual differences in economic demand for the ultra-short-acting opioid remifentanil and to test whether antagonism of Ox1Rs reduces remifentanil demand. The behavioral-economics procedure revealed robust individual differences in free consumption of remifentanil (Q(0) parameter; hedonic set point). Rats with low baseline Q(0) (low takers) displayed high demand elasticity (parameter; reduced responding as drug price increased indicating low motivation for drug), whereas subjects with a higher Q(0) (high takers) exhibit low demand elasticity (low ) by continuing to self-administer remifentanil despite increased cost (reflecting higher motivation for drug). In a punished responding paradigm utilizing footshock, subjects that were classified as high takers at baseline withstood twice as much shock as low takers to continue self-administering remifentanil. Interestingly, Ox1R antagonism with SB-334867 reduced Q(0) and increased in low takers but not in high takers. Similarly, the Ox1R antagonist attenuated cue-induced, but not drug-induced, reinstatement of remifentanil seeking in low takers but had no significant effect on reinstatement of drug seeking in high takers. Together, these data reveal a novel role of orexins in demand for remifentanil: Ox1Rs modulate demand in low takers but not in individuals that exhibit addictive-like behaviors (high takers). Finally, the behavioral assays in this study can serve as a novel laboratory model for studying individual differences in opioid use disorders.	5.0
Background: Children do not always outgrow hen's egg allergies in early childhood. Because egg yolks are less allergenic than egg whites, we performed an oral food challenge with heated egg yolk slightly contaminated with egg white (EYSEW OFC) in infants allergic to hen's egg. We hypothesized that the EYSEW OFC results would predict the egg allergy's natural course. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed participants with hen's egg allergy who underwent their first EYSEW OFC at 12-23 months of age between 2004 and 2010. Participants who passed the first EYSEW OFC were defined as EYSEW-tolerant, and participants who failed the OFC were defined as EYSEW-reactive. Participants who passed the EYSEW OFC underwent an OFC with half of a heated whole egg (WE OFC). Participants who passed a WE OFC were defined to be heated hen's egg-tolerant. Participants who failed the EYSEW OFC or the WE OFC underwent another OFC at least 6 months later. We compared tolerance to heated hen's egg at 36 months after the first EYSEW OFC between EYSEW-tolerant and EYSEW-reactive participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Of the 197 included participants (median age: 18.3 months; range: 12.1-23.8 months), 179 (90.9 %) were EYSEW tolerant and 18 (9.1 %) were EYSEW reactive. At 36 months after the first EYSEW OFC, 164 EYSEW-tolerant (91.6 %) and 12 EYSEW-reactive participants (66.7 %) achieved heated hen's egg tolerance. In the univariate logistic regression analyses, EYSEW-reactive participants (crude odds ratio [OR], 5.5 [95 % confidence intervals [CI], 1.8-16.6]; p = 0.003) and those with baseline egg white sIgE levels (crude OR: 3.9 per ten-fold increase [95 % CI, 1.5-10.2]; p = 0.005) had greater odds of persistent allergy to hen's egg at 36 months after the first EYSEW OFC. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustment for baseline egg white sIgE, EYSEW-reactive participants had greater odds of persistent allergy to hen's egg than EYSEW-tolerant participants (adjusted OR: 4.6 [95 % CI, 1.5-15.0]; p = 0.003). Conclusions: Classifying infants who are allergic to hen's egg into EYSEW tolerant and EYSEW reactive groups was useful in determining prognosis.	5.1
The degradation of urban river ecosystems presents a serious threat to sustainable urban development. Consequently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the ecological restoration of urban rivers worldwide. This study evaluates the environmental externalities associated with water pollution and river restoration in Guangzhou in southern China. A basic hedonic pricing model is applied to test hypotheses using a sample of 968 apartment transaction records during July-December 2013. Results show that river restoration could reverse negative externalities of polluted watercourses to positive externalities, especially for those apartments located on the 10th floor or lower. Water quality improvement from polluted non-recreational water (Grade V or worse) to non-body contact recreational water (Grade IV) could increase apartment values by 0.9%. River restoration (including river bank greening and water quality improvement) could increase property values by 4.61%, demonstrating a preference of Guangzhou residents for greening riverscapes. This study could hopefully provide a scientific basis for urban river governance for communities and decision-makers, and serve as a reference case to elucidate human preferences about river restoration in rapidly developing countries.

This paper presents an integrated error propagation analysis method to estimate the measurement uncertainty using Monte Carlo method in order to analyze the measurement accuracy of an H-drive stage with air bearing during high acceleration subjected to the influence of a variety of errors, including straightness errors, thermal errors, deformation errors and air bearing gap change errors caused by acceleration force. Firstly, the integrated error propagation model of an H-drive stage is built combined with the effects of the various error sources based on the multi-body system and instrument precision theory. Then these errors are identified by experiments and finite element analysis and the influence of each error in six degrees of freedom displacement is obtained. Finally, the displacement measurement uncertainty of the stage in the reference coordinate system is evaluated by Monte Carlo method, within 95% probability, the displacement measurement results and the expanded uncertainty in x and y directions are calculated x=(165.000 +/- 0.064) mm and y=(195.000 +/- 0.054) mm respectively. The proposed method can be used in the error budget of precise machine design and applied in error compensation to improve the measurement and control accuracy of precise machine workpiece stage.

The tractability of the budding yeast genome has provided many insights into the fundamental mechanisms regulating cellular life. With the advent of synthetic biology and single-cell measurements, novel tools are required to manipulate the yeast genome in a more controlled manner. We present, here, a new family of yeast shuttle vectors called single integration vectors (pSIV). Upon transformation in yeast, these plasmids replace the entire deficient auxotrophy marker locus by a cassette containing an exogenous marker. As shown using flow cytometry, this complete replacement results in a unique integration of the desired DNA fragment at the marker locus. In addition, a second transcriptional unit can be inserted to achieve the simultaneous integration of two constructs. The selection marker cassettes, present in the pSIV, were also used to generate a complete set of gene tagging plasmids (pGT) encompassing a large palette of fluorescent proteins, from a cyan fluorescent protein to a near-infrared tandem dimer red fluorescent protein. These tagging cassettes are orthogonal to each other thanks to the use of different TEF promoter and terminator couples, thereby avoiding marker cassette switching and favoring integration in the desired locus. In summary, we have created two sets of robust molecular tools for the precise genetic manipulation of the budding yeast.	6.0
Laser sintered technology has been introduced for clinical use and can be utilized more widely, accompanied by the digitalization of dentistry and the development of direct oral scanning devices. This study was performed with the aim of comparing the marginal accuracy and internal fit of Co-Cr alloy copings fabricated by casting, CAD/CAM (Computer-aided design/Computer-assisted manufacture) milled, and 3-D laser sintered techniques. A total of 36 Co-Cr alloy crown-copings were fabricated from an implant abutment. The marginal and internal fit were evaluated by measuring the weight of the silicone material, the vertical marginal discrepancy using a microscope, and the internal gap in the sectioned specimens. The data were statistically analyzed by One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), a Scheffe's test, and Pearson's correlation at the significance level of p = 0.05, using statistics software. The silicone weight was significantly low in the casting group. The 3-D laser sintered group showed the highest vertical discrepancy, and marginal-, occlusal-, and average-internal gaps (p < 0.05). The CAD/CAM milled group revealed a significantly high axial internal gap. There are moderate correlations between the vertical marginal discrepancy and the internal gap variables (r = 0.654), except for the silicone weight. In this study, the 3-D laser sintered group achieved clinically acceptable marginal accuracy and internal fit.	3.0
Large-scale severe natural disturbance events drive spatial and temporal patterns of forests by altering forest structure, composition, and functions. In the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany, windthrow events led to large disturbances caused by the European bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). Until recently, it was assumed that at the initial stage of regeneration, trees tend to form a homogeneous stand structure, whereas structural heterogeneity is an attribute of later developmental stages. Yet recent studies provide evidence that under certain conditions structural heterogeneity can arise much earlier in stand development. Here we combined LiDAR data and forest growth modeling based on individual trees to develop a workflow for studying forest development in post -disturbed areas in the upper montane regions of the national park. The current forest structure was derived from LiDAR data of individually detected trees and a set of forest structural attributes were derived. The results served as input to simulate tree development spatio-temporally for a period of 80 years. Several spatial statistics, including landscape and spatial point pattern metrics, were calculated to assess the structural heterogeneity. The results showed that naturally regenerating forests on post-disturbed sites reveal structural heterogeneity already at the early-seral stage. Moreover, a significant portion of the eventual old -growth structural heterogeneity might already be determined in the early successional stages. Our workflow highlights the use of multi-sensor aerial remote sensing to provide detailed structural information useful for the investigation of early-phase forest dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In discretely fractured reservoirs such as those found in Enhanced/Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS), knowledge of the fracture network is important in understanding the thermal hydraulics, i.e., how the fluid flows and the resulting temporal evolution of the subsurface temperature. The purpose of this study was to develop an analytical model of the fluid flow and heat transport in a discretely fractured network that can be used for a wide range of modeling applications and serve as an alternative analysis tool to more computationally intensive numerical codes. Given the connectivity and structure of a fracture network, the flow in the system was solved using a linear system of algebraic equations for the pressure at the nodes of the network. With the flow determined, the temperature in the fracture was solved by coupling convective heat transport in the fracture with one-dimensional heat conduction perpendicular to the fracture, employing the Green's function derived solution for a single discrete fracture. The predicted temperatures along the fracture surfaces from the analytical solution were compared to numerical simulations using the TOUGH2 reservoir code. Through two case studies, we showed the capabilities of the analytical model and explored the effect of uncertainty in the fracture apertures and network structure on thermal performance. While both sources of uncertainty independently produce large variations in production temperature, uncertainty in the network structure, whenever present, had a predominant influence on thermal performance.	3.1
Racism and racialisation can be framed as a threat to one's ontological security. This article draws from qualitative life history interviews conducted with 11 Aboriginal people who are part of an existing longitudinal health study based in the city of Brisbane. The narratives revealed that perceptions of racism and racialisation were a significant consideration for these people when asked to reflect on their identity and wellbeing over time. Though less frequently overt, racism was often seen to be perpetrated from within one's social circle, revealing the complicated process of engaging, contesting, rejecting, ignoring, minimising, avoiding and defining racism. The findings highlight the agency of Aboriginal people in adapting their behaviour to avoid or minimise the dread of ontological insecurity.	2.0
Although the vast majority of existing work on empathy focuses exclusively on the socio-emotional consequences of empathizing with others' negative emotions, mounting evidence supports the view that empathy for others' negative emotions and empathy for others' positive emotions are distinct capacities. The present work seeks to marry this burgeoning literature on the separability of positive and negative empathy to the influential literature on approach and avoidance motivation by examining how these two distinct empathic capacities relate to the (pro)social motivations to assist others to approach positivity vs. avoid negativity. The results of two studies show that whereas positive empathy is associated with an other-focused motivation to assist others to approach positive outcomes and is predictive of helping only when that help is framed as a means of propelling others toward greater positivity, negative empathy is associated with an other-focused motivation to assist others to avoid negative outcomes and is associated with helping only when that help is framed as a means of assisting others to avoid further suffering. In addition to contributing to the emerging literature on the separability of positive and negative empathy, these results also help to extend the influential approach/avoidance distinction to the domain of other-focused motivation.

When do descriptive regularities (what characteristics individuals have) become prescriptive norms (what characteristics individuals should have)? We examined children's (4-13years) and adults' use of group regularities to make prescriptive judgments, employing novel groups (Hibbles and Glerks) that engaged in morally neutral behaviors (e.g., eating different kinds of berries). Participants were introduced to conforming or non-conforming individuals (e.g., a Hibble who ate berries more typical of a Glerk). Children negatively evaluated non-conformity, with negative evaluations declining with age (Study 1). These effects were replicable across competitive and cooperative intergroup contexts (Study 2) and stemmed from reasoning about group regularities rather than reasoning about individual regularities (Study 3). These data provide new insights into children's group concepts and have important implications for understanding the development of stereotyping and norm enforcement.	2.1
Much is known about young children's helping behavior, but little is known about the underlying motivations and emotions involved. In 2 studies we found that 2-year-old children showed positive emotions of similar magnitude-as measured by changes in their postural elevation using depth sensor imaging technology-after they achieved a goal for themselves and after they helped another person achieve her goal. Conversely, children's posture decreased in elevation when their actions did not result in a positive outcome. These results suggest that for young children, working for themselves and helping others are similarly rewarding.	2.4
It has been widely accepted that reinforcement made of polyethylene and polypropylene is susceptible to creep and soil's hydraulic conductivity varies with its void ratio. However, unfortunately there is no available sensitivity analysis on time-dependent embankment behaviour taking either reinforcement viscosity or time varying hydraulic conductivity of subsoil into consideration. The influence of geosynthetic reinforcement viscosity and decreasing hydraulic conductivity with consolidation on the time-dependent performance of embankments with floating columns is investigated using a fully 3D coupled model. For an embankment at the working height corresponding to a post-consolidation polypropylene geotextile strain of about 5%, it is shown that the assumption of constant hydraulic conductivity and the failure to consider the viscous behaviour of geosynthetic reinforcement can underestimate time-dependent embankment deformations (including differential crest settlement and horizontal toe movement). The effects of factors including the foundation soil, reinforcement stiffness, column stiffness, column spacing, column type (floating and fully penetrating), and construction rate, on the time-dependent behaviour of column supported embankments are explored.

A predictive framework for the evolution of stem cell biology in 3-D is currently lacking. In this study we propose deep image informatics of the nuclear biology of stem cells to elucidate how 3-D biomaterials steer stem cell lineage phenotypes. The approach is based on high content imaging informatics to capture minute variations in the 3-D spatial organization of splicing factor SC-35 in the nucleoplasm as a marker to classify emergent cell phenotypes of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The cells were cultured in varied 3-D culture systems including hydrogels, electrospun mats and salt leached scaffolds. The approach encompasses high resolution 3-D imaging of SC-35 domains and high content image analysis (HCIA) to compute quantitative 3-D nuclear metrics for SC-35 organization in single cells in concert with machine learning approaches to construct a predictive cell-state classification model. Our findings indicate that hMSCs cultured in collagen hydrogels and induced to differentiate into osteogenic or adipogenic lineages could be classified into the three lineages (stem, adipogenic, osteogenic) with >= 80% precision and sensitivity, within 72 h. Using this framework, the augmentation of osteogenesis by scaffold design exerted by porogen leached scaffolds was also profiled within 72 h with similar to 80% high sensitivity. Furthermore, by employing 3-D SC-35 organizational metrics, differential osteogenesis induced by novel electrospun fibrous polymer mats incorporating decellularized matrix could also be elucidated and predictably modeled at just 3 days with high precision. We demonstrate that 3-D SC-35 organizational metrics can be applied to model the stem cell state in 3-D scaffolds. We propose that this methodology can robustly discern minute changes in stem cell states within complex 3-D architectures and map single cell biological readouts that are critical to assessing population level cell heterogeneity. Statement of Significance The sustained development and validation of bioactive materials relies on technologies that can sensitively discern cell response dynamics to biomaterials, while capturing cell-to-cell heterogeneity and preserving cellular native phenotypes. In this study, we illustrate the application of a novel high content image informatics platform to classify emergent human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) phenotypes in a diverse range of 3-D biomaterial scaffolds with high sensitivity and precision, and track cell responses to varied external stimuli. A major in silico innovation is the proposed image profiling technology based on unique three dimensional textural signatures of a mechanoreporter protein within the nuclei of stem cells cultured in 3-D scaffolds. This technology will accelerate the pace of high-fidelity biomaterial screening. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.1
Background: The dementia syndrome has been regarded a clinical diagnosis but the focus on supplemental biomarkers is increasing. An automatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetry method, NeuroQuant (R) (NQ), has been developed for use in clinical settings. Purpose: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of NQ in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) from nondementia and non-AD dementia. Material and Methods: NQ was performed in 275 patients diagnosed according to the criteria of ICD-10 for AD, vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD); the Winblad criteria for mild cognitive impairment; the LundManchester criteria for frontotemporal dementia; and the revised consensus criteria for Lewy body dementia (LBD). Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses with calculation of area under the curve (AUC) and regression analyses were carried out. Results: Forebrain parenchyma (AUC 0.82), hippocampus (AUC 0.80), and inferior lateral ventricles (AUC 0.78) yielded the highest AUCs for AD/non-dementia discrimination. Only hippocampus (AUC 0.62) and cerebellum (AUC 0.67) separated AD from non-AD dementia. Cerebellum separated AD from PDD-LBD (AUC 0.83). Separate multiple regression analyses adjusted for age and gender, showed that memory (CERAD 10-word delayed recall) (beta 0.502, P< 0.001) was more strongly associated to the hippocampus volume than the diagnostic distinction of AD versus nondementia (beta -0.392, P< 0.001). Conclusion: NQ measures could separate AD from non-dementia fairly well but generally poorer from non-AD dementia. Degree of memory impairment, age, and gender, but not diagnostic distinction, were associated to the hippocampus volume in adjusted analyses. Surprisingly, cerebellum was found relevant in separating AD from PDD-LBD.	5.2
Implicit measures of racial attitudes often assess reactions to images of individuals to infer attitudes toward an entire social category. However, an increasing amount of research indicates that responses to individuals are highly dependent on context and idiosyncratic features of individual exemplars. Thus, using images of individuals to assess beliefs about a whole social category may not be ideal. Across three time points, we predicted that using images of groups would mitigate the influence of idiosyncratic features of individual targets and, thus, provide a better measurement tool to assess beliefs about a category to which all group members belong. Results revealed that an implicit measure that presented images of Black and White groups had greater construct validity, test-retest reliability, and predictive validity as compared with an implicit measure that presented the same exemplars individually. We conclude that groups provide a window into existing beliefs about social categories.	2.0
Nonlinear stability study of the neutron coupled thermal hydraulics instability has been carried out by several researchers for boiling water reactors (BWRs). The focus of these studies has been to identify sub critical and supercritical Hopf bifurcations. Supercritical Hopf bifurcation are soft or safe due to the fact that stable limit cycles arise in linearly unstable region; linear and global stability boundaries are same for this bifurcation. It is well known that the subcritical bifurcations can be considered as hard or dangerous due to the fact that unstable limit cycles (nonlinear phenomena) exist in the (linearly) stable region. The linear stability leads to a stable equilibrium in such regions, only for infinitesimally small perturbations. However, finite perturbations lead to instability due to the presence of unstable limit cycles. Therefore, it is evident that the linear stability analysis is not sufficient to understand the exact stability characteristics of BWRs. However, the effect of these bifurcations on the stability boundaries has been rarely discussed. In the present work, the identification of global stability boundary is demonstrated using simplified models. Here, five different models with different thermal hydraulics feedback have been investigated. In comparison to the earlier works, current models also include the impact of adding the rate of change in temperature on void reactivity as well as effect of void reactivity on rate of change of temperature. Using the bifurcation analysis of these models the globally stable region in the parameter space has been identified. The globally stable region has only stable solutions and does not have even unstable limit cycles. Hence, the system is stable irrespective of the size of the perturbation in these regions.

Quantifying the contributions of climate change and human activities to ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) changes is important for adaptation assessment and sustainable development. Spatiotemporal patterns of ET and GPP were estimated from 2000 to 2014 over North China Plain (NCP) with a physical and remote sensing-based model. The contributions of climate change and human activities to ET and GPP trends were separated and quantified by the first difference de-trending method and multivariate regression. Results showed that annual ET and GPP increased weakly, with climate change and human activities contributing 0.188 mm yr(-2) and 0.466 mm yr(-2) to ET trend of 0.654 mm yr(-2), and-1.321 g C m(-2) yr(-2) and 7.542 g C m(-2) yr(-2) to GPP trend of 6.221 g C m(-2) yr(-2), respectively. In cropland, the increasing trends mainly occurred in wheat growing stage; the contributions of climate change to wheat and maize were both negative. Precipitation and sunshine duration were the major climatic factors regulating ET and GPP trends. It is concluded that human activities are the main drivers to the long term tendencies of water consumption and gross primary productivity in the NCP.	4.2
This article describes the ways in which music is an important part of identity, and hence serves some similar functions to other forms of identity-related communication (e. g., language). It will describe how music is used to incite intergroup hatred (e. g., among soccer fans, military music) and to support valued identities (anthems, etc.). Relevant literature on stereotyping (including stereotyping of groups related to music) is included. The article also discusses how music is used to reduce intergroup hostility (e. g., via cross-cultural musical collaboration and contact). The article connects the various literatures from communication, social psychology, sociology, and ethnomusicology, providing a broad overview of the many connections between communication, music, and social identity. It closes with a research agenda for those interested in studying intergroup communication and music.	2.0
The natural circulation of primary coolant plays an important role in removing the decay heat in Station Black-out (SBO) accident from reactor core to decay heat removal systems, such as RVACS and PHXS cooling, for lead-based reactor. In order to study the natural circulation characteristics of primary coolant under Reactor Vessel Air Cooling System (RVACS) and primary heat exchangers (PHXs) cooling, which are crucial to the safety of lead-based reactors. A three-dimensional CFD model for the China Lead-based Research Reactor (CLEAR-I) has been built to analyze the thermal-hydraulics characteristics of primary coolant system and the cooling capability of the two systems. The abilities of the two cooling systems with different decay heat powers were discussed as well. The results demonstrated that the decay heat could be removed effectively only relying on either of the two systems. However, RVACS appeared the obvious thermal stratification phenomenon in the cold pool. Besides, with the increase in decay heat power, the natural circulation capacity of primary coolant between the two systems had a significant difference. The PHXs cooling system was stronger than the RVACS, with respect to the mass flow of primary coolant and the average temperature difference between cold pool and hot pool. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ambient Assisted Working (AAW) is a discipline aiming to provide comfort and safety in the workplace through customization and technology. Workers' comfort may be compromised in many labor situations, including those depending on environmental conditions, like extremely hot weather conduces to heat stress. Occupational heat stress (OHS) happens when a worker is in an uninterrupted physical activity and in a hot environment. OHS can produce strain on the body, which leads to discomfort and eventually to heat illness and even death. Related ISO standards contain methods to estimate OHS and to ensure the safety and health of workers, but they are subjective, impersonal, performed a posteriori and even invasive. This paper focuses on the design and development of real-time personalized monitoring for a more effective and objective estimation of OHS, taking into account the individual user profile, fusing data from environmental and unobtrusive body sensors. Formulas employed in this work were taken from different domains and joined in the method that we propose. It is based on calculations that enable continuous surveillance of physical activity performance in a comfortable and healthy manner. In this proposal, we found that OHS can be estimated by satisfying the following criteria: objective, personalized, in situ, in real time, just in time and in an unobtrusive way. This enables timely notice for workers to make decisions based on objective information to control OHS.	4.0
This study aims at presenting the process of machine design and agricultural implements by means of a reference model, formulated with the purpose of explaining the development activities of new products, serving as a guideline to coach human resources and to assist in formalizing the process in small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), i.e. up to 500 employees. The methodology used included the process modeling, carried out from case studies in the SMB, and the study of reference models in literature. The modeling formalism used was based on the IDEF0 standard, which identifies the dimensions required for the model detailing: input information; activities; tasks; knowledge domains; mechanisms; controls and information produced. These dimensions were organized in spreadsheets and graphs. As a result, a reference model with 27 activities and 71 tasks was obtained, distributed over four phases of the design process. The evaluation of the model was carried out by the companies participating in the case studies and by experts, who concluded that the model explains the actions needed to develop new products in SMB.	3.3
The aim of this work is to study the effect of a localized impact on a wall made of soil reinforced with geocells. First, two structures were tested with an impacting remote-controlled car. Such experiments, carried out on 1/10th-scale model structures for practical reasons, are designed to mimic the mechanical response of an alveolar geocell reinforcement system. Two types of constitutive materials were considered for the geocells with very different mechanical properties. The test structures were dismantled after the tests to analyse the influence of the impact on the cell layers, especially within their bulk. Examining the video of the tests captured with two high-speed cameras also helped understanding the phenomena that occurred during impact. These experiments were completed by numerical simulations whose objective was to understand more clearly the causes of the phenomena observed either within the dismantled structures or in the videos.

In this paper a new framework is introduced to develop a coupled active and reactive market in distribution networks. Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as synchronous machine-based distributed generations and wind turbines offer their active and reactive powers to the proposed market. For the considered DERs, multicomponent reactive power bidding structures are introduced based on their capability curves. Also, the hourly speed variations of wind turbines are considered in the proposed model. A distribution company buys active and reactive powers from a wholesale market and sells them via this market. The demand side is active, and responsive loads or aggregators can participate in the market using a demand bidding/buyback program. The objective function of the proposed market is to minimize the active and reactive power costs of DERs and distribution companies, the penalty cost of CO2 emission, and the cost of running a demand bidding/buyback program. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined on a 22-bus 20-kV radial distribution test system.	1.0

Background and aims: To determine the relationship between the risk of exercise addiction (REA) and health status in amateur endurance cyclists. Methods: In 859 (751 men and 108 women) cyclists and 718 inactive subjects (307 men and 411 women), we examined the REA (Exercise Addiction Inventory), training status (volume, frequency, experience, and performance), socioeconomic status, quality of life (QoL) (SF-12), quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and cardiometabolic risk: body mass index, physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), physical condition (International Fitness Scale), adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener), alcohol and tobacco consumption. Results: In total, 17% of the cyclists showed evidence of REA and 83% showed low REA. REA occurred independent of age, sex, training, and socioeconomic status (all ps >.05). Regardless of REA, the cyclists displayed a better physical QoL and a lower cardiometabolic risk than the inactive subjects (all ps < .05). The cyclists with REA displayed worse values of mental QoL, quality of sleep, and anxiety than cyclists with low REA (all ps < .05). The REA group had better values of mental QoL and anxiety and similar values of quality of sleep than the inactive subjects. The differences in mental QoL between the REA and low REA groups were significantly greater in women (p = .013). There was no Addiction x Sex interaction in the other analyzed variables. Conclusion: Our results suggest that an increased prevalence of REA limits the benefits that amateur endurance cycling has on mental health and quality of sleep.	5.0
Shortage is common in many markets, such as those for human organs or blood, but the problem is often difficult to solve through price adjustment, given safety and ethical concerns. In this paper, we study two non-price methods that are often used to alleviate shortage for human blood. The first method is informing existing donors of a current shortage via a mobile message and encouraging them to donate voluntarily. The second method is asking the patient's family or friends to donate in a family replacement (FR) program at the time of shortage. Using 447,357 individual donation records across 8 years from a large Chinese blood bank, we show that both methods are effective in addressing blood shortage in the short run but have different implications for total blood supply in the long run.

Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n=1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n=21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.	2.0
The advancements in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have introduced new computing paradigms (e.g., cloud computing, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence and aware-computing) where the techniques for processing, storing, communicating, sharing, and disseminating information have radically changed. These novel computing paradigms bring enormous benefits: the availability of a universal access to data; the reduction in power, storage, hardware, and software costs; and the availability of elastic storage and computation services. While these advantages are appealing, as a side effect there is a tremendous risk of exposure of confidential or sensitive information to privacy breaches. WPES is a yearly forum, this year at its 15th edition, aiming at discussing the open privacy challenges, emerging directions, and original novel approaches for guaranteeing privacy in today's global interconnected society.	4.0
This paper presents an analysis of the security performance and evaluation of the hardware architecture of the redundant bit security (RBS) cryptosystem. RBS is a lightweight symmetric encryption algorithm that targets resource-constrained RFID devices. Unlike the existing cryptosystems, RBS simultaneously provides confidentiality, authentication, and integrity of the plaintext by inserting hash-generated redundant bits among the already modified plaintext data. A flexible-length hash algorithm in our optimized hardware architecture allows RBS to support different key sizes which allows flexibility in the security level. Our analysis shows the resilience of RBS against powerful and well-known attacks such as differential attacks and known-plaintext attacks. We compare the performance of the RBS cryptosystem against other distinguished ciphers developed for RFID systems. Simulation results show that RBS results in approximately 100%, 239%, and 153% higher hardware efficiencies while requiring 48%, 56%, and 59% less energy-per-bit compared to H-PRESENT, HB-2, and Grain, respectively. Such results present confirmatory evidence that RBS is a superior solution for providing security in resource-constrained systems such as RFID systems especially when authentication is a priority.	0.3
Recycling is defined as the process that changes materials into new products for preventing the waste of potentially useful materials, reducing the consumption of fresh raw materials, the energy usage and the air and water pollution. Many of the large, existing buildings which don't have any historical importance, such as industrial type, office buildings or apartments, have a reinforced concrete structure. Recycled concrete is mainly used as coarse aggregate and filler in road construction industry; another usage of it could be adding it into new mixtures. So far this usage has led to a significant decrease in mechanical properties for the new mixture. It is well known that the cement industry is an important energy consumer and also a CO2 releaser. Present paper is devoted to the use of recycled concrete materials obtained from concrete elements into new mixes as a replacement of the cement. An experimental program was developed in this purpose; physical and physical-chemical tests were made on obtained materials, The mechanical properties of the obtained mortar samples have been also studied.	4.4
Objective: To fabricate orthodontic brackets from esthetic materials and determine their fracture resistance during archwire torsion.. Materials and Methods: Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing technology (Cerec inLab, Sirona) was used to mill brackets with a 0.018 x 0.025-inch slot. Materials used were Paradigm MZ100 and Lava Ultimate resin composite (3M ESPE), Mark II feldspathic porcelain (Vita Zahnfabrik), and In-Ceram YZ zirconia (Vita Zahnfabrik). Ten brackets of each material were subjected to torque by a 0.018 x 0.025-inch stainless steel archwire (G&H) using a specially designed apparatus. The average moments and degrees of torsion necessary to fracture the brackets were determined and compared with those of commercially available alumina brackets, Mystique MB (Dentsply GAC). Results: The YZ brackets were statistically significantly stronger than any other tested material in their resistance to torsion (P < .05). The mean torques at failure ranged from 3467 g.mm for Mark II to 11,902 g.mm for YZ. The mean torsion angles at failure ranged from 15.3 to 40.9 degrees. Conclusion: Zirconia had the highest torsional strength among the tested esthetic brackets. Resistance of MZ100 and Lava Ultimate composite resin brackets to archwire torsion was comparable to commercially available alumina ceramic brackets.	3.0
Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain are the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques are composed of beta-amyloid peptides (A beta), while NFTs contain hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Patients with familial AD who have mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene have either increased production of A beta or generate more aggregation-prone forms of A beta. The findings of familial AD mutations in the APP gene suggest that A beta plays a central role in the pathophysiology of AD. A beta 42, composed of 42 amino acid residues, aggregates readily and is considered to form amyloid plaque. However, the processes of plaque formation are still not well known. It is generally thought that A beta is secreted into the extracellular space and aggregates to form amyloid plaques. A beta as extracellular aggregates and amyloid plaques are thought to be toxic to the surrounding neurons. The intraneuronal accumulation of A beta has more recently been demonstrated and is reported to be involved in synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and the formation of amyloid plaques in AD. We herein provide an overview of the process of the intraneuronal accumulation of A beta and plaque formation, and discuss its implications for the pathology, early diagnosis, and therapy of AD.	5.2
For river water quality monitoring at 30m x 1-day spatio-temporal scales, a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is developed for estimating turbidity (T-u), total suspended solid (TSS), and six heavy metals (HV) of iron, zinc, copper, chromium, lead and cadmium, by blending the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat (L-s) spectral bands. A combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques are applied to develop spectral relationships between Tu-L5, TSS-T,, and each HV-TSS. The STARFM algorithm and all the developed relationship models are evaluated satisfactorily by various performance evaluation measures to develop heavy metal pollution index-based vulnerability maps at 1-km resolution in the Brahmani River in eastern India. The Monte-Carlo simulation based analysis of the developed formulations reveals that the uncertainty in estimating Zn and Cd is the minimum (1.04%) and the maximum (5.05%), respectively. Hence, the remote sensing based approach developed herein can effectively be used in many world rivers for real-time monitoring of heavy metal pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: Phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes is decreased in healthy pregnancy and further decreased in preeclampsia. The cause of the declined function is unknown. Decreased phagocyte function can lead to the higher infection rate in healthy pregnancy and may also be responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections and high trophoblast concentration in preeclampsia. The aim of this study is to examine the phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes. Methods: Monocytes and neutrophil granulocytes were separated from the peripheral circulation of six nonpregnant patients and incubated in plasma samples from six healthy pregnant, six preeclamptic pregnant, and six nonpregnant patients. The cells were marked and evaluated for the phagocytosis index with immunofluorescent microscope after phagocyting the zymosan molecules. Results: Phagocyte function of neutrophils as well as monocytes from nonpregnant patients were decreased significantly when the cells were incubated in plasma samples from healthy pregnant patients, and further decreased when incubated in plasma samples from preeclamptic pregnant women. Conclusion: The decreased phagocyte function of neutrophil granulocytes and that of monocytes in healthy pregnancy and the further decreased phagocyte function in preeclampsia is caused by factor(s) in the maternal circulation.	6.3
In fluid mechanics, how to solve multiple solutions in ordinary differential equations is always a concerned and difficult problem. An improved RNA genetic algorithm inspired by RNA molecular structure and operators is proposed for solving the parameter estimation problems of the multiple solutions that described as the flow of the fluid through a porous channel with expanding or contracting walls. In this paper, multiple solutions can be found through changing accuracy and search coverage and multi-iterations of computer. At last, the ordinary differential equations is calculated, and the result has great accuracy and this method is practical. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	3.4
The latest results of anthropological studies of bone remains from the earliest Upper Paleolithic burial discovered on Russian territory, the Markina Gora site (Kostenki 14), are described. Multivariate statistical methods and parallel studies of the buried skull structure and dentition established that their morphological characteristics undoubtedly belonged to the Caucasian complex. In combination with paleogenetic data, the findings contradict the earlier hypothesis of the southern origin of the Kostenki 14 individual and its similarity to the population of the Australo-Melanesian region.	6.4
Exposures to particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) may influence the risk of birth defects and make you allergic, which causes serious harm to human health. Bamboo charcoal can adsorb harmful substances, that was of benefitto people's health. In order to figure out the optimal adsorbtion condition and the intrinsic change of bamboo charcoal, five chemicals were adsorbed by bamboo charcoal and were analyzed by FT-IR. The optimal blast time was 80 min of Na2SO3, 100 min of Na2S2O8, 20 min of Na2SO4, 120 min of Fe-2(SO4)(3) and 60 min or 100 min of S. FT-IR spectra showed that bamboo charcoal had five characteristic peaks of SAS stretch, H2O stretch, O-H stretch, C=O stretch or C=C stretch, and NO2 stretch at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 3430 cm(-1), 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1), respectively. For Na2SO3, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 3430 cm(-1), 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 20 min. For Na2S2O8, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 3430 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min. For Na2SO4, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min. For Fe-2(SO4)(3), the peaks at 3850 cm(-1), 3740 cm(-1), 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 120 min. For S, the peaks at 3850 cm(-1) and 3740 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min, the peaks at 1630 cm(-1) and 1530 cm(-1) achieved the maximum at 40 min. It proved that bamboo charcoal could remove sulfur powder from air to restrain sulfur allergies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.	5.1
Objective: The interleukin 17 (IL-17) cytokine family is involved in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. In spite of contradictory findings and a lack of causality in clinical studies, IL-17 inhibition for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has regained attention as a potential therapeutic pathway, after demonstrating disease-modifying capabilities in ankylosing spondylitis. We investigated the clinical associations of interleukin 17 A (IL-17A) in patients with SLE. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed involving SLE patients (n= 102; age: 49 years; 86% female) recruited from a regional registry. IL-17A levels were determined by immunoassay, disease activity by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2K (SLEDAI-2K), and cumulative damage by Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics Damage Index (SDI) scores. Non-parametric techniques were used to examine the association between IL-17A and disease activity and autoantibody profiles were compared with healthy controls (n= 31): principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the interplay of immune cells across disease states and damage development in SLE patients. Results: SLE patients had higher IgG levels, lower T-cell and B-cell counts, but median IL-17A levels did not differ from the controls (28.4 vs. 28.4 pg/mL, p= 0.9). In SLE patients, IL-17A did not correlate with SLEDAI-2K or SDI, but was inversely related with age (correlation coefficients, Rs.=- 0.29, p< 0.05), systolic blood pressure (Rs.=- 0.31, p< 0.05), years of smoking (Rs.=- 0.43, p< 0.05), cumulative heart (Rs.=- 0.22, p< 0.05), and malignancy damage (Rs.=- 0.18, p< 0.05). Serological correlations for IL-17A existed with immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (Rs.= 0.21, p< 0.05), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels (Rs.= 0.28, p< 0.05), proteinuria (Rs.= 0.64, p< 0.05), and pre- albumin (Rs.=- 0.22, p< 0.05). Longitudinal data showed only modest fluctuation in IL- 17A levels, independent of SLEDAI- 2K. Conclusion: These results suggest that IL- 17A, while participating in inflammation, may also serve a protective purpose in SLE patients.	5.3
Performance of any digital control scheme applied to inverters, or any other power electronic structures, can significantly suffer due to time delays. These time delays can be linear and nonlinear. An example of a linear delay is the delay due to sampling, control calculation and application of the new voltage state, which results in a constant delay present in each control cycle. An example of a non-linear delay is the inverter dead-time, which is different depending on the selected switching state and the direction of the load current. Both types of delays are well-known and are addressedin literature. At the same time, the known solutions result in significantly more complicated hardware and/or software implementations. Introduction of MPC to power electronics gives a new and unique opportunity to compensate for both types of the delays in a clear and effective way. This can be done by including the delays, both linear and non-linear, in the model predictions. As an illustration, this paper presents an MPC-based design of closed-loop current control with linear delay compensation for voltage source inverters. The paper also proposes a variable rate MPC-based voltage modulator which combines harmonic suppression with inverter dead-time compensation. The main points of the paper are illustrated by extensive simulation and experimenal results.	1.4
Background and aims: The aims of this study were to examine the association between social skills deficits and Internet addictio n and activities in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as the moderators for this association. Methods: A total of 300 adolescents, aged between 11 and 18 years, who had been diagnosed with ADHD participated in this study. Their Internet addiction levels, social skills deficits, ADHD, parental characteristics, and comorbidities were assessed. The various Internet activities that the participants engaged in were also examined. Results: The associations between social skills deficits and Internet addiction and activities and the moderators of these associations were examined using logistic regression analyses. Social skills deficits were significantly associated with an increased risk of Internet addiction after adjustment for the effects of other factors [odds ratio (OR) = 1.049, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.030-1.070]. Social skills deficits were also significantly associated with Internet gaming and watching movies. The maternal occupational socioeconomic levels of the participants moderated the association between social skills deficits and Internet addiction. Conclusions: Social skills deficits should be considered targets in prevention and intervention programs for treating Internet addiction among adolescents with ADHD.	5.0
Appearance cues and brief displays of behavior are related to people's personality, to their performance at work and to the outcomes of elections. Thus, people present themselves to others on different communication channels, while their interaction partners form first impressions on the basis of the displayed cues. In the current study we examined whether people are able to read information from politicians' body motion. For a rating experiment we translated short video clips of politicians giving a speech into animated stick-figures and had these animations rated on trustworthiness, dominance, competence and the Big Five personality dimensions. Afterwards we correlated the ratings with the applause and the hecklings that the speakers received throughout their entire speech. This revealed that speakers whose body movements were perceived as high on dominance, as high on extraversion and as low on agreeableness received more applause. Although the results obtained need support from additional studies they indicate that body motion is an informative cue in real life settings. (C) 2014 The Authors. published by Elsevier Ltd.	2.3
Fundamental concepts in biochemistry important for drug design often lack connection to the macroscopic world and can be difficult for students to grasp, particularly those in introductory science courses at the high school and college level. Educational research has shown that multisensory teaching facilitates learning, but teaching at the high school and college level is almost exclusively limited to the visual and auditory senses. This approach neglects the lifetime of experience our students bring to the classroom in the form of taste perception and makes our teaching less supportive of those with sensory impairment. In this article, we outline a novel guided-inquiry activity that utilizes taste perception for a series of natural and artificial sweetener solutions to introduce the concepts of substrate affinity and selectivity in the context of drug design. The findings from this study demonstrate clear gains in student knowledge, as well as an increase in enthusiasm for the fields of biochemistry and drug design.

There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral close and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion (Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 units of excretion. Within individuals, dose - excretion data fitted a linear regression model (median R-2 = 0.93) We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.	6.2
The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency of traditional risk factors for the cardiovascular (CV) disease, to calculate the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) for CV-related mortality in Danish patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and to compare with results from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the same settlement. All PsA and AS patients aged 18-85 years from one outpatient clinic were invited. A rheumatology nurse conducted 30-min screening consultation, preceded by a lipid and glucose profile. High SCORE risk led to recommendation of follow-up by general practitioners. Multiple and logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age and gender, were performed, to compare risk factors and risk SCOREs. Participants were 116 AS (29.3% female) and 170 PsA (54.7% female). AS had opposed PsA patients' lower 10-year risk SCOREs of CV mortality than RA patients: AS versus RA coefficient -0.47 (confidence interval (CI) 95%: -0.84 to -0.) and PsA versus RA -0.14, (-0.43-0.16). Women with PsA and AS had increased waistline compared to women with RA [PsA vs. RA 7.94 (4.51-11.38); AS versus RA 6.67 (1.17-12.17)], and an increased prevalence of hypertension was seen in AS versus RA patients [1.87 (1.15-3.05)]. Traditional, modifiable CV risk factors were present in PsA and AS patients. AS but not PsA patients had an estimated lower 10-year risk of CV mortality than RA patients, according to the SCORE model adjusted for age and gender.	5.3
It has been recognized that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show discrepancies between their abstract capacities to solve social cognition dilemmas and their ability to spontaneously decipher live social interactions. In the last 15 years, different paradigms have been designed to investigate how individuals with ASD grasp information when emerged in naturalistic or live social interactions. The present paper reviews three categories of such paradigms that focus on (1) verbal questionnaires and interviews while participants view a naturalistic social scenario, (2) eye tracking methods while participants view naturalistic settings, and (3) simulation of social interactions using virtual reality or robotics. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of each paradigm and suggests a new concept for combining these paradigms.	2.1
Longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles of alluvial channels are altered by the presence of seepage. However, the available literature suggests that seepage has not been considered in analyses of bank profiles of threshold alluvial channels. In the experimental study reported here, downward seepage was applied to parabolic channels based on tractive force theory in order to determine its effect on the longitudinal and cross-sectional profiles. It was observed that sediment transport in the threshold channels increased when downward seepage was applied. The parabolic shape did not hold, but channels formed a new cross-sectional shape with a flat bed and two curved banks and achieved stability. The reason for the increased sediment transport in a threshold channel after the application of downward seepage was sought by analysing the time-averaged velocities. An empirically derived exponential expression was developed for the bank profiles of threshold alluvial channels affected by seepage. A relationship among hydraulic parameters for a stable channel with downward seepage is also suggested on the basis of the experimental observations.	3.1
This paper is a tribute to the tercentenary of Leibniz's (1646-1716) death. After Aristotle (384-322 BC), one of the most impressive and original accomplishments of building rational knowledge about nature can be found in Leibniz's dynamics. Furthermore, his science of motion occupies a prominent place in his thought. In addition to these theoretical developments, Leibniz designed a calculating machine which performed the four arithmetic operations and worked as a mining engineer in Harz (Germany), with the design and construction of windmills. In this paper Leibniz's contributions to machine science, namely dynamics and machine design, are presented and discussed.	3.3
PIGE and PIXE techniques were employed to the study of elemental constituents of some traditional medicinal plants generally used in curing many diseases and ailments in southwestern Nigeria. Analyses were also carried out on commonly edible vegetables of medicinal and pharmacological importance. PIGE measurements were carried out using 3.5-MeV collimated protons from the 7 mV CN Van-de-Graaff accelerator of INFN, LNL, Legnaro (Padova), Italy, whereas the PIXE measurements were carried out using 1.8 MeV from the 2.5 MV AN 2000 Van-de-Graaff accelerator of the same laboratory. The results show that many of the medicinal plants contain elements of cardinal importance in human metabolism. The results from the vegetables also show the presence of vital elements that are needed for growth and development. In addition, some of the toxic elements, which include As, Cd, Hg, and so forth, were not detected. However, some of the recipes contain trace amounts of Pb at very low concentrations. This calls for proper control of dose rates in some samples to prevent the attendant negative cumulative effects.	6.2
A new sub-space max-monomial modeling scheme for CMOS transistors in sub-micron technologies is proposed to improve the modeling accuracy. Major electrical parameters of CMOS transistors in each sub-space from the design space are modeled with max-monomials. This approach is demonstrated to have a better accuracy for sub-micron technologies than singlespace models. Sub-space modeling based geometric programming power optimization has been successfully applied to three different op-amps in 0.18 mu m technology. HSPICE simulation results show that sub-space modeling based GP optimization can allow efficient and accurate analog design. Computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints. An efficient scheme in dealing with non-convex constraint inherent in Kirchhoff's voltage law is suggested in this paper. By using this scheme, the nonconvex constraint, such as posynomial equality, can be relaxed to a convex constraint without affecting the result.	1.3
Hadoop has become a widely used open source framework for large scale data processing. MapReduce is the core component of Hadoop. It is this programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. It allows processing of extremely large video files or image files on data nodes. This can be used for implementing Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) algorithms on Hadoop to compare and match query images to the previously stored terabytes of an image descriptors databases. This work presents the implementation for one of the well-known CBIR algorithms called Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) for image features extraction and matching using Hadoop platform. It gives focus on utilizing the parallelization capabilities of Hadoop MapReduce to enhance the CBIR performance and decrease data input\output operations through leveraging Partitioners and Combiners. Additionally, image processing and computer vision tools such as Hadoop Image Processing (HIPI) and Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) are integration is shown.	0.0
Wind-induced and earthquake-induced excitations on tall structures can be effectively controlled by Tuned Liquid Damper (TLD). This work presents a numerical simulation procedure to study the performance of tuned liquid tank-structure system through sigma-transformation based fluid-structure coupled solver. For this, a 'C' based computational code is developed. Structural equations are coupled with fluid equations in order to achieve the transfer of sloshing forces to structure for damping. Structural equations are solved by fourth order Runge-Kutta method while fluid equations are solved using fmite difference based sigma transformed algorithm. Code is validated with previously published results. The minimum displacement of structure is observed when the resonance condition of the coupled system is satisfied through proper tuning of TLD. Since real-time excitations are random in nature, the performance study of TLD under random excitation is also carried out in which the Bretschneider spectrum is used to generate the random input wave.	3.4
The aim was to investigate the impact of PPARG and APOE gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and additional gene- gene interaction on late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk based on Chinese Han population. A total of 928 participants (466 males, 462 females), with a mean age of 81.3 +/- 16.4 years old, were included in the study, including 460 LOAD patients and 468 normal controls participants. Logistic regression was performed to investigate association between SNP and LOAD risk and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) was used to analysis the gene-gene interaction. Logistic regression analysis showed that LOAD risk was significantly higher in carriers of G allele of the rs405509 polymorphism than those with AA (AG+ GG versus AA, adjusted OR (95%CI) =1.54(1.20-1.89), and higher in carriers of G allele of the rs1805192 polymorphism than those with CC (CG+ GG versus CC, adjusted OR (95%CI) =1.32(1.16-2.43). We also found that there was a potential gene-gene interaction between rs405509 and rs1805192. Participants with AG or GG of rs405509 and CG or GG of rs1805192 genotype have the highest AD risk, compared to participants with AA of rs405509 and CC of rs1805192 genotype, OR (95%CI) was 2.62(1.64 -3.58), after covariates adjustment. G allele of the rs405509 of APOE and G allele of the rs1805192 of PPAR G polymorphism were associated with increased LOAD risk, and participants with AG or GG of rs405509 and CG or GG of rs1805192 genotype have the highest AD risk.	5.2
Purpose of reviewPrimary cilia have become important organelles implicated in embryonic development, organogenesis, health, and diseases. Although many studies in cell biology have focused on changes in ciliary length or ciliogenesis, the most common readout for evaluating ciliary function is intracellular calcium.Recent findingsRecent tools have allowed us to examine intracellular calcium in more precise locations, that is, the cilioplasm and cytoplasm. Advances in calcium imaging have also allowed us to identify which cilia respond to particular stimuli. Furthermore, direct electrophysiological measurement of ionic currents within a cilium has provided a wealth of information for understanding the sensory roles of primary cilia.SummaryCalcium imaging and direct measurement of calcium currents demonstrate that primary cilia are sensory organelles that house several types of functional calcium channels. Although intracellular calcium now allows a functional readout for primary cilia, discussions on the relative contributions of the several channel types have just begun. Perhaps, all of these calcium channels are required and necessary to differentiate stimuli in different microenvironments.	6.1
Stability of power converters has become more and more important in hybrid green energy systems because of its difficulties to maintain a stable dc-bus. This paper presents dynamic characteristics of a digital integral gain changeable control dc-dc converter to realize high stability with suppression of the output capacitance. The integral gain changeable control method uses a variable integral gain, which is changed by the value of load current. The stability analysis is conducted by Bode diagrams. It is shown that the transient response and stability of the integral gain changeable method are better than the conventional fixed integral gain control method even if the output capacitance is smaller than the conventional method. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of our concept.	1.4
Despite the popularity of GPUs in high-performance and scientific computing, and despite increasingly general-purpose hardware capabilities, the use of GPUs in network servers or distributed systems poses significant challenges. GPUnet is a native GPU networking layer that provides a socket abstraction and high-level networking APIs for GPU programs. We use GPUnet to streamline the development of high-performance, distributed applications like in-GPU-memory MapReduce and a new class of low-latency, high-throughput GPU-native network services such as a face verification server.	0.4
The objective of this study was to investigate the risks associated with the use of roof-harvested rainwater (RHRW) and the implication of pigeons as the most likely source of contamination by testing for antibiotic resistance profiles of Escherichia coli. A total of 239 E. coli were isolated from thirty fresh pigeon faecal samples (130 isolates), 11 RHRWtanks from three sites in Pretoria (78) and two in Johannesburg (31). E. coli isolates were tested against a panel of 12 antibiotics which included ampicillin, amoxicillin, amikacin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline. In all samples, resistance to ampicillin (22.7.9 %), gentamicin (23.6 %), amikacin (24 %), tetracycline (17.4) and amoxicillin (16.9 %) were the most frequently encountered form of resistance. However, a relatively higher proportion of isolates from pigeon faeces (67.3 %) were antibiotic resistant than those from RHRW (53.3 %). The highest number of phenotypes was observed for single antibiotics, and no single antibiotic resistance was observed for chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, cefoxitin, cotrimoxazole, although they were detected in multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotypes. The highest multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) phenotypes were observed for a combination of four antibiotics, on isolates from JHB (18.8 %), pigeon faeces (15.2 %) and Pretoria (5.1 %). The most abundant resistance phenotype to four antibiotics, Ak-Gm-Cip-T was dominated by isolates from pigeon faeces (6.8 %) with Pretoria and Johannesburg isolates having low proportions of 1.3 and 3.1 %, respectively. Future studies should target isolates from various environmental settings in which rainwater harvesting is practiced and the characterisation of the antibiotic resistance determinant genes among the isolates.	4.3
Due to the ability to model large deformations and the ease of dealing with boundary conditions in a Lagrangian framework, the material point method is getting more popularity in geotechnical engineering applications. In this paper, the material point is tentatively applied to model problems of hydrodynamics as an introduction to this field. Dam-break flows with different initial aspect ratios are simulated in both the material point method and an extensively verified shallow water equations model. In order to test the accuracy and stability of the material point method, simulations of dam-break flows are carried out and the results are in good agreement with other validated numerical methods and experimental data. From the comparisons between the simulations in both the material point method and shallow water equations model, a critical aspect ratio value for the applicability of the shallow water equations is found to be 1. The material point method shows its potential to tackle hydrodynamics related problems. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	3.1
This study focuses on characterizing the effect of a high salt diet (HSD) on intestinal immunity and the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We found that mice on a HSD had an increased frequency of IL-17A producing cells in the intestinal lamina propria (LP) compared to mice on a normal diet (ND). Furthermore, most intestinal IL-17A producing cells were CD4(+)TCR beta(+) cells. A HSD increased the LP T helper 17 (Th17) responses in both the small and large intestines but did not increase the Th17 response of other gut-associated lymphoid organ. Although, HSD did not change the percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells, HSD significantly inhibit secretion of IL-10 and the suppressive function of Treg cells. Moreover, we found that HSD exacerbates trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis, and Th17 response was significantly increased in the colonic LP of HSD TNBS-treated mice compared with the ND TNBS-treated mice. This study demonstrates that HSD stimulates the intestinal Th17 response but inhibits the function of Treg cells. Moreover, HSD exacerbates TNBS induced mice colitis, suggesting that HSD disrupts the intestinal immunity and increases the risk of IBD.	6.3
The time-dependent behavior of soils has been investigated extensively using one-dimensional and triaxial tests. The phenomena associated with time effects in soils are creep, relaxation; strain rate and re-arrangement effects. The engineering properties of soil are often improved significantly with the elapse of time. The objective of this paper is to investigate the time-dependent effect on the shear strength parameters of sand-geosynthetic interface using large direct shear test apparatus. For this purpose, the geotextile layer was carefully adhered to a piece of rigid block with a thickness such that half of the shear test box is occupied. The other half of the box has been filled with sand and the test performed. Three normal stresses of 30, 45, and 60 kPa have been applied in all tests. The shear stress has subsequently been applied at different times to the failure stage. In all tests, the shearing velocity has been kept the same. The results of these experiments show that the stiffuess and friction angle of the sand-geotextile interface increases up to 35% and 5.5% at 720 minutes after the sample is poured in the mold. These increases occur mostly in the first two hours following the normal stress application to the samples. The findings in this paper are interesting to consider in practice.	4.1
For the many application domains concerning entities and their connections, often their data can be formally represented as graphs and an important problem is detecting an anomalous subgraph within it. Numerous methods have been proposed to speed-up anomalous subgraph detection; however, each incurs non-trivial costs on detection accuracy. In this paper, we formulate the anomalous subgraph detection problem as the maximization of a non-parametric scan statistic and then approximate it to a submodular maximization problem. We propose two parallel algorithms: non-coordination anomalous subgraph detection (NCASD) and under-coordination anomalous subgraph detection (UCASD) for the anomalous subgraph detection. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to solve this problem in parallel. NCASD emphasizes speed at the expense of approximation guarantees, while UCASD achieves a higher approximation factor through additional coordination controls and reduced parallelism. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches in a real-world application domain (water pollution detection), comparing them with five other state-of-the-art methods.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to analyze the parenting experiences of mothers of children who stutter based on the grounded theory. Methods: The participants were six mothers of children who stutter. An in-depth interview was conducted, transcribed and analyzed according to the grounded theory method. Results: The data was analyzed into 172 concepts, 33 subcategories and 16 categories. The core phenomenon in the parenting experiences of mothers of children who stutter was a sense of 'Ultimate repression for normality'. The causal conditions of the core phenomenon were found to be an 'Apparent stuttering manifestation'. This phenomenon was found to be reinforced by the contextual conditions of 'Vague expectation,' 'Child's response' and 'Support from others'. 'Personality tendency', ' Personal values', and ' Putting on a front' were found to be the remedial factors with respect to the core phenomenon of a sense of Ultimate repression for normality'. Among the remedial strategies reported for 'Ultimate repression for normality' were ' Exploring methods', 'Compromise', 'Avoidance' and 'Badgering'. Those remedial strategies created 'Confidence,' 'Low self-esteem' and 'Remorse'. The parenting experiences of mothers of children who stutter were classified into four types. Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that any program intended to remedy a mother's sense of 'Ultimate repression for normality' should be managed not only by the clinicians themselves, but also by an academy or professional association. The study further concluded that societal prejudice against stuttering needs to be dealt with at the societal and governmental levels.	2.0
Thermal conductivity is a key property that controls heat migration in a variety of applications including municipal solid waste and/or mining/industrial containment facilities. In particular, heat may be encountered in cases where geosynthetic lining systems are exposed to elevated temperatures due to either waste biodegradation, solar radiation, or mining processes. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation on thermal conductivity of nonwoven geotextiles, geosynthetic clay liners and an HDPE geomembrane. A steady state method was used to measure the thermal conductivity of a selected number of these materials. The thermal conductivity of the HDPE geomembrane was found to be consistent with the thermal conductivity of HOPE polymer. On the other hand, the thermal conductivity of the nonwoven geotextiles depended on water content and whether they are hydrophobic or hydrophilic. The form of bentonite, its mass per area and water content affected the thermal conductivity of GCLs. The results presented in this paper provide a lower bound of thermal conductivities of geosynthetics routinely used in waste containment facilities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1
Phototropin1 is a blue light (BL) receptor in plants and shows BL-dependent kinase activation. The BL-excited light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain 2 (LOV2) is primarily responsible for the activation of the kinase domain; however, the molecular mechanism by which conformational changes in LOV2 are transmitted to the kinase domain remains unclear. Here, we investigated BL-induced structural changes of a minimum functional fragment of Arabidopsis phototropin1 composed of LOV2, the kinase domain, and a linker connecting the two domains using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The fragment existed as a dimer and displayed photoreversible SAXS changes reflected in the radii of gyration of 42.9 angstrom in the dark and 48.8 angstrom under BL irradiation. In the dark, the molecular shape reconstructed from the SAXS profiles appeared as two bean-shaped lobes in a twisted arrangement that was 170 angstrom long, 80 angstrom wide, and 50 angstrom thick. The molecular shape under BL became slightly elongated from that in the dark. By fitting the crystal structure of the LOV2 dimer and a homology model of the kinase domain to their inferred shapes, the BL-dependent change could be interpreted as the positional shift in the kinase domain relative to that of the LOV2 dimer. In addition, we found that lysine 475, a functionally important residue, in the N-terminal region of LOV2 plays a critical role in transmitting the structural changes in LOV2 to the kinase domain. The interface between the domains is critical for signaling, suitably changing the structure to activate the kinase in response to conformational changes in the adjoining LOV2.	6.0
In order to optimize energy production in MFCs, a better understanding of anodic communities is essential. Our objective was to determine the taxonomic structure of the bacterial communities present at the surface of the anode during the formation and development of electro-active biofihns in MFCs inoculated with fresh primary clarifier overflow. Quantitative microbial community dynamics were evaluated as a function of time and electrical performance using 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic microarrays and flow cytometry. Results show that the bacterial community stabilized partially but not completely when voltage output was stable. Geobacter appeared to be the predominant genus, whose growth was associated with voltage, while some other genus still developed or declined after the voltage stabilization. Flow cytometry revealed that some genus showing a decreasing proportional fluorescence intensity over time were still actively respiring bacteria, and thus, active albeit minor members of the biofilm. Finally, this study shows that anodic biofilm selection and maturation is still occurring after more than 20 days of operation and over ten days after voltage is stabilized.	1.0
Key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) is an important key distribution mechanism that not only allows both sender and receiver to safely share a random session key, but also can be mainly applied to construct a hybrid public key encryption scheme. In this paper, we give an positive answer to the question of if it is possible to build an efficient KEM over lattices. More precisely, wedesign an efficientKEMscheme in standard model based on ideal lattices. We prove that the proposed scheme captures indistinguishability against active chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA) under the ring learning with errors problem, or more formally, IND-CCA security. Compared with the current CCA secure KEM schemes based on lattices in the standard model, our scheme has shorter public key, secret key and encapsulation ciphertext. In addition, our KEM scheme realizes IND-CCA security in the standard model.	0.3
In the past decade, the power of harnessing T-cell co-signaling pathways has become increasingly understood to have significant clinical importance. In cancer immunotherapy, the field has concentrated on two related modalities: First, targeting cancer antigens through highly activated chimeric antigen T cells (CAR-Ts) and second, re-animating endogenous quiescent T cells through checkpoint blockade. In each of these strategies, the therapeutic goal is to re-ignite T-cell immunity, in order to eradicate tumors. In transplantation, there is also great interest in targeting T-cell co-signaling, but with the opposite goal: in this field, we seek the Yin to cancer immunotherapy's Yang, and focus on manipulating T-cell co-signaling to induce tolerance rather than activation. In this review, we discuss the major T-cell signaling pathways that are being investigated for tolerance induction, detailing preclinical studies and the path to the clinic for many of these molecules. These include blockade of co-stimulation pathways and agonism of coinhibitory pathways, in order to achieve the delicate state of balance that is transplant tolerance: a state which guarantees lifelong transplant acceptance without ongoing immunosuppression, and with preservation of protective immune responses. In the context of the clinical translation of immune tolerance strategies, we discuss the significant challenge that is embodied by the fact that targeted pathway modulators may have opposing effects on tolerance based on their impact on effector vs regulatory T-cell biology. Achieving this delicate balance holds the key to the major challenge of transplantation: lifelong control of alloreactivity while maintaining an otherwise intact immune system.	6.1
this paper, we propose an algebraic language, called Time-AgLOTOS, which is dedicated to express BDI agent plans, according to the features and requirements of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. Plan expressions are written and composed using Time-AgLOTOS, so that plans are built automatically and on the fly, as a system of concurrent processes. This language describes the time-dependent behavior of the agent and provides a theoretical foundation for performing planning under timing constraints, taking into account the duration of actions. Also, it allows to express behavioral capabilities such as communication, mobility and cooperation. In this context, we show how to achieve a powerful mechanism for a contextual guidance based on a specific and formal construction called Contextual Time Planning System (CTPS).	4.0
Three studies examined the role of need for affect (NFA) and need for cognition (NFC) in intergroup perception. We hypothesized that NFA predicts a preference for stereotypically warm groups over stereotypically cold groups, whereas NFC predicts a preference for stereotypically competent groups over stereotypically incompetent groups. Study 1 supported these hypotheses for attitudes toward stereotypically ambivalent groups, which are stereotyped as high on one of the trait dimensions (e.g., high warmth) and low on the other (e.g., low competence), but not for stereotypically univalent groups, which are seen as high or low on both dimensions. Studies 2 and 3 replicated this pattern for stereotypically ambivalent groups, and yielded provocative evidence regarding several putative mechanisms underlying these associations. Together, these findings help integrate and extend past evidence on attitude-relevant individual differences with research on intergroup perception.	2.0
Sentiment analysis is an active research area in today's era due to the abundance of opinionated data present on online social networks. Semantic detection is a sub-category of sentiment analysis which deals with the identification of sentiment orientation in any text. Many sentiment applications rely on lexicons to supply features to a model. Various machine learning algorithms and sentiment lexicons have been proposed in research in order to improve sentiment categorization. Supervised machine learning algorithms and domain specific sentiment lexicons generally perform better as compared to the unsupervised or semi-supervised domain independent lexicon based approaches. The core hindrance in the application of supervised algorithms or domain specific sentiment lexicons is the unavailability of sentiment labeled training datasets for every domain. On the other hand, the performance of algorithms based on general purpose sentiment lexicons needs improvement. This research is focused on building a general purpose sentiment lexicon in a semi-supervised manner. The proposed lexicon defines word semantics based on Expected Likelihood Estimate Smoothed Odds Ratio that are then incorporated with supervised machine learning based model selection approach. A comprehensive performance comparison verifies the superiority of our proposed approach.	0.1
The first step of quantum measurement procedure is known as premeasurement, during which correlation is established between the system and the measurement apparatus. Such correlation may be classical or nonclassical in nature. One compelling nonclassical correlation is entanglement, a useful resource for various quantum information theoretic protocols. Quantifying the amount of entanglement, generated during quantum measurement, therefore, seeks importance from practical ground, and this is the central issue of the present paper. Interestingly, for a two-level quantum system, we obtain that the amount of entanglement, measured in term of negativity, generated in premeasurement process can be quantified by two factors: skew information, which quantifies the uncertainty in the measurement of an observable not commuting with some conserved quantity of the system, and mixedness parameter of the system's initial state.	0.3
Recently, Bernard, Gervais, Allen, Campomizzi, and Klein (2012) reported that individuals were less able to recognize inverted vs. upright pictures of sexualized men as compared to women. Based on their formulation of the sexualized-body-inversion hypothesis (SBIH) it was concluded that sexualized women as compared to men are perceived in a more object-like manner supporting sexual objectification (SO) of females - independent from observer gender. We challenge this interpretation and hypothesize that the originally reported effect is the result of a methodological artifact due to gender-symmetry and stimuli setup-symmetry confounds in the original stimulus set. We tested this theoretically more parsimonious account in a methodologically stricter and extended conceptual replication of the putative SO-effect. Results from two studies showed that the original stimulus set indeed suffered from symmetry confounds and that these are necessary boundary-conditions in order for the hypothetical SO-effect to occur. It is concluded that the SBIH as postulated by Bernard et al. (2012) is based on a methodological artifact and cannot be related to SO but symmetry detection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The malformation of sheet metal tapping screw threads in the screw threading process increases the cost of screw threading dies and their maintenance. Die factories do not reveal their screw threading die design techniques, so production and maintenance processes are established by trial-and-error or worker experience and passing down such techniques and documenting quality control is difficult. In this study, screw thread forming design and process analysis were carried out by combining computer-aided design software with computer-aided metal forming analysis software. Simulation results were verified in an actual forming process. The sheet metal tapping screw forging size error was less than 0.90%, except at a sharp angle, which was associated with an error of 3.075%, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of the simulated forming process. The numerical analysis process can be utilized to shorten forming development time; to reduce the number of die tests, and to improve product quality and die service life, reducing the cost of development and promoting the overall competitiveness of the company.	3.0
The principle of hyperspectral imaging leads to a variety of stripe noise in hyperspectral images, especially the wide-stripe noise, which brings great obstacles to the interpretation and application of hyperspectral images. Aiming at the wide-stripe noise of hyperspectral images of two-level production data, considering from the effect of filtering noise and the ability of protecting detail, this paper proposed a fused wide-stripe removal method based on the wavelet transform and local interpolation (WTLI), called the WTLI algorithm. On one hand, it uses the wavelet transform to remove the stripe noise as much as possible; on the other hand, it uses the local interpolation to protect more geometric and detailed information, so as to achieve the purpose of removing noise and protecting the useful information. A series of comparative experiments were carried out with hyperspectral image data. Not only have good experimental results been obtained, but also this shows that the WTLI algorithm has better stability and universality.	4.2
This paper proposes a modified cascaded multilevel grid-connected inverter (MCM-GCI) suitable for photovoltaic grid-connected generation system, which considers wide operation range, low grid current total harmonics distortion (THD), and high European efficiency. In the proposed topology, a bidirectional power switch is added to the standard single-phase cascaded multilevel inverter (CMI) to implement the transformation between CMI mode and H-bridge inverter (HBI) mode. An online topology transformation approach of the MCM-GCI is proposed to guarantee the topology modes transformed safely and smoothly. The proposed MCM-GCI operates in CMI mode when the PV arrays' output voltage and power are low, and transforms into HBI mode when the PV arrays' output voltage and power are high. Experimental results of five-level MCM-GCI are represented to validate the feasibility of the proposed topology and it is also compared with other three classic grid-connected inverters to highlight its advantages. Furthermore, more structures based on hybrid CMI, which possess the topology transformation ability, are shown to further improve the generation range and obtain a higher efficiency of the system.	1.4
In this paper we show that plants respond to downstream ambient water quality after controlling for permitted levels of pollution. We find if past water quality declines by one percent, plants reduce current pollution by 0.35 percent. The magnitude of this coefficient is comparable to the coefficient on permitted discharge levels i.e. regulatory stringency itself. Results are consistent with two mechanisms. First, a decline in water quality may lead to more stringent permits that would raise the cost of abatement of a plant significantly. Second, the plant is likely to be subject to increased public pressure in response to poor water quality. Indeed, as expected, the impact of water quality becomes stronger in locations with higher median household income, higher percent carpooling to work, or lower percent of manufacturing employment but surprisingly with lower median age of residents, lower percent with bachelor's degree or higher percent of families with children.

Electrocorticogram (ECoG) has great potential as a source signal, especially for clinical BMI. Until recently, ECoG electrodes were commonly used for identifying epileptogenic foci in clinical situations, and such electrodes were low-density and large. Increasing the number and density of recording channels could enable the collection of richer motor/sensory information, and may enhance the precision of decoding and increase opportunities for controlling external devices. Several reports have aimed to increase the number and density of channels. However, few studies have discussed the actual validity of high-density ECoG arrays. In this study, we developed novel high-density flexible ECoG arrays and conducted decoding analyses with monkey somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Using MEMS technology, we made 96-channel Parylene electrode arrays with an inter-electrode distance of 700 mu m and recording site area of 350 mu m(2). The arrays were mainly placed onto the finger representation area in the somatosensory cortex of the macaque, and partially inserted into the central sulcus. With electrical finger stimulation, we successfully recorded and visualized finger SEPs with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We conducted offline analyses in which the stimulated fingers and intensity were predicted from recorded SEPs using a support vector machine. We obtained the following results: (1) Very high accuracy (similar to 98%) was achieved with just a short segment of data (similar to 15 ms from stimulus onset). (2) High accuracy (similar to 96%) was achieved even when only a single channel was used. This result indicated placement optimality for decoding. (3) Higher channel counts generally improved prediction accuracy, but the efficacy was small for predictions with feature vectors that included time-series information. These results suggest that ECoG signals with high spatiotemporal resolution could enable greater decoding precision or external device control.	0.1
Tospoviruses (genus Tospovirus, family Bunyaviridae) are responsible for major losses in an extensive range of crops worldwide. New species of these single-stranded, ambisense RNA viruses regularly emerge and have been shown to maintain heterogeneous populations with individual isolates having quite variable biological and virulence characteristics. Most tospovirus phylogenetic studies have focused on analysis of a single gene, most often the nucleocapsid protein gene. Complete genomic RNA segment amplification as a single fragment would facilitate more detailed analyses of genome-wide sequence variability, but obtaining such sequences for a large number of tospovirus isolates using traditional methods of amplification and cloning of small overlapping fragments is tedious, time consuming and expensive. In this study, protocols were optimized to amplify, clone and sequence full-length M- and S-RNA genome segments of Tomato spotted wilt virus and Impatiens necrotic spot virus. The strategy presented here is straightforward, scalable and offers several advantages over the previously commonplace and overlapping amplicon-based approach. Use of whole genome segments, instead of individual gene sequences or defined portions of genome segments, will facilitate a better understanding of the underlying molecular diversity of tospoviruses in mixed infections.

Microscopic cell image analysis is indispensable to cell biology. Images of cells can easily degrade due to optical diffraction or focus shift, as this results in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and poor image quality, hence affecting the accuracy of cell analysis and identification. For a quantitative analysis of cell images, restoring blurred images to improve the SNR is the first step. A parameter estimation method for defocused microscopic cell images based on the power law properties of the power spectrum of cell images is proposed. The circular radon transform (CRT) is used to identify the zero-mode of the power spectrum. The parameter of the CRT curve is initially estimated by an improved differential evolution algorithm. Following this, the parameters are optimized through the gradient descent method. Using synthetic experiments, it was confirmed that the proposed method effectively increased the peak SNR (PSNR) of the recovered images with high accuracy. Furthermore, experimental results involving actual microscopic cell images verified that the superiority of the proposed parameter estimation method for blurred microscopic cell images other method in terms of qualitative visual sense as well as quantitative gradient and PSNR.

Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is increasingly utilized today by populations to alleviate water supply issues, particularly in rural, dry environments. Limited research has considered, simultaneously, the numerous factors that contribute to sustainability - for example, social acceptance, water quality, and maintenance needs - of RWH. This research aimed to improve the understanding of factors influencing the sustainability of rainwater harvesting systems for domestic use (DRWHS) through examination of social, water quality, and technical feasibility components. We conducted 50 household surveys and 17 rainwater quality analyses in San Jose Xacxamayo, a rural, semi-arid community in Puebla, Mexico. Results showed that DRWHS are socially accepted primarily because of the presence of existing local skills and knowledge, as well as critical need for water. Results from most of the water quality parameters measured were within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for human consumption, with the exception of pH, total coliform, and heterotrophic plate count, which required water treatment prior to consumption. Technical feasibility was the main barrier to the sustainability of DRWHS; highly seasonal rainfall and small roof sizes (averaging 70 m(2)) resulted in households unable to meet annual water needs. Increasing roof sizes and providing water treatment could ensure DRWHS sustainability in the studied community.	4.3
The present study aims to investigate the interplay of verbal and nonverbal communication with respect to infants' perception of pointing gestures. Infants were presented with still images of pointing hands (cue) in combination with an acoustic stimulus. The communicative content of this acoustic stimulus was varied from being human and communicative to artificial. Saccadic reaction times (SRTs) from the cue to a peripheral target were measured as an indicator of the modulation of covert attention. A significant cueing effect (facilitated SRTs for congruent compared with incongruent trials) was only present in a condition with additional communicative and referential speech. In addition, the size of the cueing effect increased the more human and communicative the acoustic stimulus was. This indicates a beneficial effect of verbal communication on the perception of nonverbal communicative pointing gestures, emphasizing the important role of verbal communication in facilitating social understanding across domains. These findings additionally suggest that human and communicative (ostensive) signals are not qualitatively different from other less social signals but just quantitatively the most attention grabbing among a number of other signals.	2.3
When permeable geosynthetic tubes are used for dewatering of waste sludge or construction of dikes or embankments, the tubes have to be inflated using sludge or soil slurry several times. After each inflation, the soil slurry is consolidated into solid. Hence from the second inflation onwards, the geosynthetic tube is filled by both slurry and consolidated soil. In this paper, a new analytical method is proposed to provide a solution to the above specific case. Friction between geosynthetic sheet and soil, and friction between geosynthetic tube and subgrade, are considered. Parametric studies are also carried out to compare the design between geosynthetic tubes inflated using pure slurry and that using slurry and consolidated soil to study the key factors affecting the design. The study shows that tensile forces vary along the cross-section of the geosynthetic tube with the minimum value occurring at the center of the base. The effect of friction and lateral earth pressure on the geometry and tensile forces of the geosynthetic tube is insignificant when the height of the consolidated soil in the tube is small, but increases considerably with an increase in the height.

There are many data pre-processing techniques that aim at enhancing the quality of classifiers induced by machine learning algorithms. Functional expansions (FE) are one of such techniques, which has been originally proposed to aid neural network based classification. Despite of being successfully employed, works reported in the literature use the same functional expansion, with the same expansion size (ES), applied to each attribute that describes the training data. In this paper it is argued that FE and ES can be attribute-oriented and, by choosing the most suitable FE-SE pair for each attribute, the input data representation improves and, as a consequence, learning algorithms can induce better classifiers. This paper proposes, as a pre-processing step to learning algorithms, a method that uses a genetic algorithm for searching for a suitable FE-SE pair for each data attribute, aiming at producing functionally extended training data. Experimental results using functionally expanded training sets, considering four classification algorithms, KNN, CART, SVM and RBNN, have confirmed the hypothesis; the proposed method for searching for FE-SE pairs through an attribute-oriented fashion has yielded statistically significant better results than learning from the original data or by considering the result from the best FE-SE pair for all attributes.

Server-side socialbot detection approaches can identify malicious accounts and spams in online social networks. However, they cannot detect socialbot processes, residing on user hosts, which control these accounts. Therefore, new approaches are needed to detect socialbots on hosts. The fundamental to design host-side detecting approaches is to gain an insight into the behaviors of socialbots on host. In this article, we analyzed a series of representative socialbots in depth and summarized the typical features of socialbot behaviors. We proposed a new approach to defense against socialbots on end host. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) our analysis approach can be used for reference during analyzing new socialbots in the future; (2) we provide several behavior features of socialbots on hosts, including network flow through which socialbots communicate with botmasters through the online social network, system calls via which socialbots conduct an activity, and process information of socialbots running on hosts. These features can be used by someone to design approaches to identifying socialbots on a host; (3) our proposed detection approach can effectively distinguish between a socialbot and a benign application on end hosts.	0.2
People's emotional states often depend on the emotions of others. Consequently, to predict their own responses to social interactions (i.e., affective forecasts), we contend that people predict the emotional states of others (i.e., empathic forecasts). We propose that empathic forecasts are vulnerable to stereotype biases and demonstrate that stereotypes about the different emotional experiences of race (Experiment 1) and sex groups (Experiment 2) bias empathic forecasts. Path modeling in both studies demonstrates that stereotype-biased empathic forecasts regarding how a target individual will feel during a social interaction are associated with participants' affective forecasts of how they will feel during that interaction with the target person. These affective forecasts, in turn, predict behavioral intentions for the social interaction before it even begins. Stereotypes can therefore indirectly bias affective forecasts by first influencing the empathic forecasts that partly constitute them. In turn, these potentially biased affective forecasts determine social behaviors.	2.0
The analysis of steam generators as an interface between primary and secondary circuits in light water nuclear power plants is crucial in terms of safety and design issues. VVER-1000 nuclear power plants use horizontal steam generators which demand a detailed thermal hydraulics investigation in order to predict their behavior during normal and transient operational conditions. Two phase flow field simulation on adjacent tube bundles is important in obtaining logical numerical results. However, the complexity of the tube bundles, due to geometry and arrangement, makes it complicated. Employment of porous media is suggested to simplify numerical modeling. This study presents the use of porous media to simulate the tube bundles within a general-purpose computational fluid dynamics code. Solved governing equations are generalized phase continuity, momentum, and energy equations. Boundary conditions, as one of the main challenges in this numerical analysis, are optimized. The model has been verified and tuned by simple two-dimensional geometry. It is shown that the obtained vapor volume fraction near the cold and hot collectors predict the experimental results more accurately than in previous studies.

In this article, we present a compact implementation of the Salsa20 stream cipher that is targeted towards lightweight cryptographic devices such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. The Salsa20 stream cipher, ann addition-rotation-XOR (ARX) cipher, is used for high-security cryptography in NEON instruction sets embedded in ARM Cortex A8 CPU core-based tablets and smartphones. The existing literature shows that although classical cryptanalysis has been effective on reduced rounds of Salsa20, the stream cipher is immune to software side-channel attacks such as branch timing and cache timing attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to perform hardware power analysis attacks, where we evaluate the resistance of all eight keywords in the proposed compact implementation of Salsa20. Our technique targets the three subrounds of the first round of the implemented Salsa20. The correlation power analysis (CPA) attack has an attack complexity of 2(19). Based on extensive experiments on a compact implementation of Salsa20, we demonstrate that all these keywords can be recovered within 20,000 queries on Salsa20. The attacks show a varying resilience of the key words against CPA that has not yet been observed in any stream or block cipher in the present literature. This makes the architecture of this stream cipher interesting from the side-channel analysis perspective. Also, we propose a lightweight countermeasure that mitigates the leakage in the power traces as shown in the results of Welch's t-test statistics. The hardware area overhead of the proposed countermeasure is only 14% and is designed with compact implementation in mind.	0.3
We present a collaborative attempt to build select toolboxes of Scilab using external Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) libraries. A C/C++ interface is written for each library. Scilab variables are transferred to C/C++ variables, computations carried out through one or more function calls and variables returned to Scilab. State of the art libraries, such as Octave, COIN-OR, OpenCV and IT++ have been used to build Scilab toolboxes. Scilab is selected as the frontend as it has a block based GUI to build models, called Xcos. Optimization, Signal Processing, Communication, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Signal Processing and Identification toolboxes are in advanced stages of development and use. Control Systems and Scilab to C toolboxes are in early stages of development.	0.0
The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel (I-Kr), which is important for cardiac repolarization. Dysfunction of hERG causes long QT syndrome and sudden death, which occur in patients with cardiac ischemia. Cardiac ischemia is also associated with activation, up-regulation, and secretion of various proteolytic enzymes. Here, using whole-cell patch clamp and Western blotting analysis, we demonstrate that the hERG/I-Kr channel was selectively cleaved by the serine protease, proteinase K (PK). Using molecular biology techniques including making a chimeric channel between protease-sensitive hERG and insensitive human ether-a-go-go (hEAG), as well as application of the scorpion toxin BeKm-1, we identified that the S5-pore linker of hERG is the target domain for proteinase K cleavage. To investigate the physiological relevance of the unique susceptibility of hERG to proteases, we show that cardiac ischemia in a rabbit model was associated with a reduction in mature ERG expression and an increase in the expression of several proteases, including calpain. Using cell biology approaches, we found that calpain-1 was actively released into the extracellular milieu and cleaved hERG at the S5-pore linker. Using protease cleavage-predicting software and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified that calpain-1 cleaves hERG at position Gly-603 in the S5-pore linker of hERG. Clarification of protease-mediated damage of hERG extends our understanding of hERG regulation.

Breakthrough performances have been achieved in computer vision by utilizing deep neural networks. In this paper we propose to use random forest to classify image representations obtained by concatenating multiple layers of learned features of deep convolutional neural networks for scene classification. Specifically, we first use deep convolutional neural networks pre-trained on the large-scale image database Places to extract features from scene images. Then, we concatenate multiple layers of features of the deep neural networks as image representations. After that, we use random forest as the classifier for scene classification. Moreover, to reduce feature redundancy in image representations we derived a novel feature selection method for selecting features that are suitable for random forest classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e. MIT-Indoor and UIUC-Sports. Obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, by extracting multiple layers of deep neural networks, we can explore more information of image contents for determining their categories. Second, we proposed a novel feature selection method that can be used to reduce redundancy in features obtained by deep neural networks for classification based on random forest. In particular, since deep learning methods can be used to augment expert systems by having the systems essentially training themselves, and the proposed framework is general, which can be easily extended to other intelligent systems that utilize deep learning methods, the proposed method provide a potential way for improving performances of other expert and intelligent systems.

The influence of the acuteness of the model angle and the direction of printing was investigated on different three-dimensional (3D) printers to understand the fidelity of 3D printing. A Polyjet printer and two fused deposition modeling printers were used in the present study. Computer-aided design (CAD) models were designed in the form of a triangular prism with a height of 15 mm and with varying angles of 60A degrees, 45A degrees, 30A degrees, 20A degrees, 10A degrees, and 5A degrees. From the CAD designs, additive manufacturing (AM) models were printed in three different directions by each of the three printers. To investigate the global fidelity of the 3D printers, the height and surface outlines of the AM model cross sections were measured. The fidelity of the AM models with increasingly acute angles was not accurately reproduced when 3D printed, and the surface outlines of the AM model cross sections were different in each direction of printing for each device. Printing technology and printing direction need to be considered if accurate reproduction of acute angles in fine AM structures in medical models is a necessity.	3.0
The creation of a high bond strength between machined computer-manufactured pure titanium and porcelain remains problematic, and the effects of a silica coating on the bond strength of milled pure titanium bonded to dental porcelain require further investigation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of machined pure titanium, with an intermediate coating of silica, to dental porcelain. In this work, 24 specimens of milled pure titanium were prepared and randomly divided into test and control groups, in which the test group was coated with silica using the sol-gel dipping technique. The metal-ceramic bond strength was evaluated, according to ISO 9693 standards, using the three-point bending test, and scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy were used to study the microstructure and elemental composition of the specimens. The bonding strength of the silica-coated group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and more residual porcelain on the metal surface could be observed in the silica-coated group. Therefore, the application of a silica intermediate coating produced using the sol-gel method could significantly improve the bond strength between machined pure titanium and porcelain.	3.0
In developmental and cell biology it is crucial to evaluate the dynamic profiles of metabolites. An emerging frog model system using Xenopus tropicalis, whose genome sequence and inbred strains are available, is now ready for metabolomics investigation in amphibians. In this study we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) analysis to identify and visualize metabolomic molecular markers in tadpoles of Xenopus tropicalis. We detected tissue-specific peaks and visualized their distribution in tissues, and distinguished 19 tissues and their specific peaks. We identified, for the first time, some of their molecular localizations via tandem mass spectrometric analysis: hydrocortisone in artery, L-DOPA in rhombencephalon, taurine in eye, corticosterone in gill, heme in heart, inosine monophosphate and carnosine in muscle, dopamine in nerves, and phosphatidylethanolamine (16:0/20:4) in pharynx. This is the first MALDI-MSI study of X. tropicalis tadpoles, as in small tadpoles it is hard to distinguish and dissect the various organs. Furthermore, until now there has been no data about the metabolomic profile of each organ. Our results suggest that MALDI-MSI is potentially a powerful tool for examining the dynamics of metabolomics in metamorphosis as well as conformational changes due to metabolic changes.	6.1
The Cognitive Assessment Interview (CAI) is an interview-based instrument to assess cognition considering the impact of cognitive impairment on daily activities. We aimed to explore the associations of the Spanish version of the CAI (CAI-Sp) with a neuropsychological battery and a measure of psychosocial functioning in psychosis. The sample consisted of fifty-six first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 66 non-FEP patients, who were assessed with a neuropsychological battery, the CAI-Sp and the Short Disability Schedule (DAS-S). Patients also underwent clinical assessment. Additionally, 37 controls were assessed with the neuropsychological battery and CAI-Sp, for normalization purposes. The results showed that CAI-Sp scores were overall correlated with the neuropsychological battery in non-FEP patients. In FEP patients, we found fewer significant correlations. Most associations were maintained after controlling for clinical symptoms. CAI-Sp rater scores contributed to the variance in the DAS-S scores in both groups, as did negative and disorganized symptoms. The CAI-Sp may be a good instrument to assess cognition in non-FEP patients. In FEP patients, it was less effective in capturing cognitive impairments and their functional consequences, probably because cognitive deficits have yet to become evident, due to the recency of illness onset, and no functional disturbances were observed due to these cognitive impairments.

Stress effects in semiconductor devices have gained significant attention in semiconductor industry in recent years, and numerical modeling is often used as a powerful tool for stress analysis in semiconductor devices. Here, we present a nontraditional 1D model for fast stress analysis in bipolar junction transistors. Because bipolar transistors are operationally 1D devices, it is possible to speed up the simulation with a 1D numerical model and get results that are comparable with 2D and 3D simulation outcomes. This model consists of a complete numerical algorithm that can be used for stress analysis of bipolar transistors on any plane. Existing 1D simulators take more time as they solve all device equations throughout the device. In contrast, our model optimizes the solutions for different regions with the development and inclusion of specific algorithms. A fractional starting point is introduced for the depletion region to speed up the process further. This way, faster computing time and much higher accuracy can be reached. At the same time, popular 2D and 3D simulators, which are using finite element methods, are naturally much slower, especially if high accuracy is needed. Simulation results of this 1D model match well with the simulation results of a 2D model developed with a commercial technology computer aided design (TCAD) tool. The validity of our model was verified with experimental results and theoretical expectations as well. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	3.0
Flying capacitor converters (FCCs) are recently attracting considerable interest because of their inherent natural voltage balancing property. We develop a sampled-data model for a single-phase single-leg three-level FCC. This provides a closed-form expression for the system dynamic behavior after each switching cycle. Analysis of this model provides considerable insight on the FCC and its natural balancing property. In particular, we prove that the natural balancing property indeed holds whenever the switching frequency is sufficiently high. We also rigorously analyze dynamic properties such as the capacitor time constant and relate them to the parameter values of the load, carrier frequency and duty ratio. These results shed light on the intricate relationship between the FCC parameters and its short- and long-term dynamic behavior. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	1.2
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an austere menace to extensively used Internet-based services. The in-time detection of DDoS attacks poses a tough challenge to network security. Revealing a low-rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attack is comparatively more difficult in modern high speed networks, since it can easily conceal itself due to its similarity with legitimate traffic, and so eluding current anomaly based detection methods. This paper investigates the aptness and impetus of the information theory-based generalized entropy (GE) and generalized information distance (GID) metrics in detecting different types of DDoS attacks. The results of GE and GID metrics are compared with Shannon entropy and other popular information divergence measures. In addition, the feasibility of using these metrics in discriminating a high-rate DDoS (HR-DDoS) attack from a similar looking legitimate flash event (FE) is also verified. We used real and synthetically generated datasets to elucidate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme in detecting different types of DDoS attacks and FEs. The results clearly show that the GE and GID metrics perform well in comparison with other metrics and have reduced false positive rate (FPR). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.2
Objective To describe the communication techniques used by clients and veterinarians during companion animal visits in Australia. Design A cross-sectional descriptive study. Methods A total of 64 veterinary consultations were audiotaped and analysed with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS); clients completed appointment level measures, including their satisfaction and perceptions of relational communication. Results Participants were 24 veterinarians and 64 clients. Statements intended to reassure clients were expressed frequently in the consultations, but in 59% of appointments empathy statements were not expressed towards either the client or the patient. In 10% of appointments, veterinarians did not used any open-ended questions. Overall client satisfaction was high and veterinarians' expressions of empathy directed to the client resulted in higher levels of client satisfaction. Clients' perceptions of relational communication were related to several veterinarian and client nonverbal scales. Conclusions A focus on developing evidence-based clinical communication skills is expected to further enhance the veterinarian-client-patient relationship and associated clinical outcomes. Particular recommendations include the development of a broader emotion-handling repertoire, increased emphasis on the use of open-ended enquiry, including assessment of the client's perspective, as well as attention to aspects of nonverbal communication. The study provides preliminary evidence for the importance of verbal expressions of empathy during the companion animal consultation.	2.3
This paper presents a cycle efficient software frequency response analyzer (SFRA), which is integrated into the firmware of the digitally controller power converter to measure the frequency response of the plant and the open-loop gain of the closed-loop system. The algorithm uses the readily available measurements taken for the power stage control and does not require additional hardware. This enables periodic measurement of the frequency response which can be used to monitor changes in the power converter. The proposed technique can run on a conventional microcontroller without any host intervention, and adds no cost to the system, which is important for the cost-sensitive power converters. Both floating point and fixed point implementation are compared enabling widespread applicability of the technique. In order to validate the efficacy of the analyzer, a synchronous buck power converter is designed and its control transfer function is compared with the measured online frequency response. An algorithm is outlined to fit the measured SFRA data to a pole-zero format through intelligent cost function estimation. The correlation of zeros and poles identified using this method with the modeled plant transfer function is analyzed. A dual core approach is discussed to run SFRA on a high-switching-frequency converter, thus showing applicability of the technique in high-switching-frequency converters.	1.4
Objective: Few studies have evaluated the effects of visual remediation strategies in schizophrenia despite abundant evidence of visual-processing alterations in this condition. We report preliminary, case-study-based evidence regarding the effects of visual remediation in this population. Method: We describe implementation of a visual-perceptual training program called ULTIMEYES (UE) and initial results through 3 brief case studies of individuals with schizophrenia. UE targets broad-based visual function, including low-level processes (e.g., acuity, contrast sensitivity) as well as higher level visual functions. Three inpatients, recruited from a research unit, participated in at least 38 sessions 3 to 4 times per week for approximately 25 min per session. Contrast sensitivity (a trained task), as well as acuity and perceptual organization (untrained tasks), were assessed before and after the intervention. Levels of progression through the task are also reported. Results: UE was well tolerated by the participants and led to improvements in contrast sensitivity, as well as more generalized gains in visual acuity in all 3 participants and perceptual organization in 2 participants. Symptom profiles were somewhat different for each participant, but all were symptomatic during the intervention. Despite this, they were able to focus on and benefit from training. The adaptive nature of the training was well suited to the slower progression of 2 participants. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: These case studies set the stage for further research, such as larger, randomized controlled trials of the intervention that include additional assessments of perceptual function and measures of cognition, social cognition, and functional outcomes.	2.1
The goal of this work was to develop an easy-to-use and engaging irrigation scheduling tool for cotton which operates on a smartphone platform. The model which drives the Cotton Smartlrrigation App (Cotton App) is an interactive ET-based soil water balance model. The Cotton App uses meteorological data from weather station networks, soil parameters, crop phenology, crop coefficients, and irrigation applications to estimate root zone soil water deficits (RZSWD) in terms of percent as well as of inches of water. The Cotton App sends notifications to the user when the RZSWD exceeds 40%, when phenological changes occur, and when rain is recorded at the nearest weather station. It operates on both iOS and Android operating systems and was released during March 2014. The soil water balance model was calibrated and validated during 2012 and 2013 using data from replicated plot experiments and commercial fields. The Cotton App was evaluated in field trials for three years and performed well when compared to other irrigation scheduling tools. Its geographical footprint is currently limited to the states of Georgia and Florida, United States, because it is enabled to use meteorological data only from weather station networks in these states. A new version is currently under development which will use national gridded meteorological data sets and allow the Cotton App to be used in most cotton growing areas of the United States.

It is well-known that the performance of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement depends, to a great extent, on the support condition under the slab. The Texas Department of Transportation (TXDOT) recognized the importance of the support condition and requires the use of a stabilized base, either a 10.16-cm hot mix asphalt layer or a minimum 2.54-cm asphalt concrete over a 15.24-cm cement-stabilized layer. For pavement design purposes, 81.4 MPa/m has been used as the default value for the modulus of the subgrade reaction (k value) for the support provided by these bases. The use of a single value of 81.4 MPa/m for the k value in rigid pavement design was partly because of the insensitivity of the required slab thickness to the modulus of the subgrade reaction in the current TXDOT rigid pavement design procedure. To improve rigid pavement design, TXDOT developed a new design procedure for continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) on the basis of mechanistic-empirical principles and plans to implement the procedure. In this design procedure, the slab support has rather more substantial effects on the required slab thickness than the current TXDOT design procedure. To increase the reliability of the new pavement design procedure, accurate evaluations of the k value are important. A test section was constructed in which various base types were used, and a number of field tests were conducted to estimate the range of k values for the support systems that are currently used or expected to be utilized, including the placement of nonwoven geotextile in lieu of the asphalt layer. The current practice of using one default value of 81.4 MPa/m needs to be revised, and the use of nonwoven geotextile is not recommended until further evaluations prove its viability.

This paper focuses on the development of an agent-based intelligent distributed surface machining system structure through traditional manufacturing engineering activity analysis and systematic software engineering method. The advantages of a distributed system structure include ease of manipulation, high expandability, flexibility and the achievement towards the goal of networked manufacture. The proposed system has presented the feasibility in applying software agent-based technology in constructing a distributed freeform surface machining environment. Several agents have been developed in the proposed system: (1) preliminary evaluation agent, (2) sophisticated evaluation agent, and (3) post processor agent. Preliminary evaluation agent is in evaluation on the surface machining based on surface curvatures. Sophisticated evaluation agent could be accessed if the surface could not be machined by three axis milling machine based on the calculation results from preliminary evaluation, this agent can suggest either four or five axis machine that could be applied for the surface milling operation based on visibility cone. Post processor agent takes care of generation of the NC codes for milling operation. This agent can also convert five-axis NC codes among different five-axis milling machines when the machine's mechanism could be defined. These agents communicate via pre-defined performatives underlying knowledge query and manipulation language (KQML) for the surface machining capability. The developed system has then been successfully implemented in forming a distributed shoe surface machining system. This means agent technology is very promising in enhancing the communication of a distributed system to be able to communicate with higher level knowledge rather than only in remote function call through platform independent networking architecture.	3.2
A spectrum of disease extends beyond the rigid confines of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) encompasses non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in individuals without established radiographic changes but with other clinical/imaging axSpA features and AS in those with definite sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic X-rays. A broad consensus about the management of nr-axSpA is emerging among clinicians, but the evidence base remains open to question. To explore whether nr-axSpA and AS should be treated similarly, we examined the literature on their prevalence, natural history, disease burden, and treatment. There is strong evidence that nr-axSpA and AS are expressions of the same disease. Approximately 10% of patients with nr-axSpA will develop radiographic disease over 2 years; after >20 years, the figure may exceed 80%. Nr-axSpA patients have lower CRP and less spinal inflammation on MRI than AS patients but similar disease activity, pain, and quality-of-life impairment. Most patients with nr-axSpA manage well with conservative treatment, but a minority has severe disabling symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nr-axSpA and AS. Current evidence does not clearly indicate that anti-TNF treatment can inhibit or limit bony progression of AS, the basis of conservative and anti-TNF treatment is control of symptoms and function. For some patients with nr-axSpA, the need for powerful treatments is as great as in some with AS; thus, treatment of axSpA should be consistent across the axSpA spectrum with anti-TNF agents being available, irrespective of radiographic change, according to the same criteria as those applied to AS.	5.3
High-throughput screening (HTS) is currently the mainstay for the identification of chemical entities capable of modulating biochemical reactions or cellular processes. With the advancement of biotechnologies and the high translational potential of small molecules, a number of innovative approaches in drug discovery have evolved, which explains the resurgent interest in the use of HTS. The oncology field is currently the most active research area for drug screening, with no major breakthrough made for the identification of new immunomodulatory compounds targeting transplantation-related complications or autoimmune ailments. Here, we present a novel in vitro murine fluorescent-based lymphocyte assay easily adapted for the identification of new immunomodulatory compounds. This assay uses T or B cells derived from a transgenic mouse, in which the Nur77 promoter drives GFP expression upon T-or B-cell receptor stimulation. As the GFP intensity reflects the activation/ transcriptional activity of the target cell, our assay defines a novel tool to study the effect of given compound(s) on cellular/biological responses. For instance, a primary screening was performed using 4,398 compounds in the absence of a target hypothesis, which led to the identification of 160 potential hits displaying immunomodulatory activities. Thus, the use of this assay is suitable for drug discovery programs exploring large chemical libraries prior to further in vitro/in vivo validation studies.	6.3
Software fault tolerance is an important issue when using software systems in safety-critical applications. In such systems, software robustness is an essential requirement for improving software fault tolerance. Since an operating system (OS) is a major part of a safety-critical system, its robustness has considerable influence on the system's overall robustness. In recent years, researchers have emphasized the importance of considering the OS state in robustness testing. OS state is determined by analysis of the interactions between OS components. In this paper, an approach, named TIMEOUT, is proposed for robustness testing of embedded real-time OSs. This approach reveals the impact of time delays, i.e. inputs with invalid timing delay, on the OS kernel functionality. TIMEOUT takes the OS state into account and improves the existing robustness testing methods. The proposed approach has been implemented and the experiments have been performed on Linux PREEMPT-RT, which is an embedded real-time implementation of Linux operating system. The results show that OS state can influence the OS behavior with respect to fault tolerance, in the presence of time delays. Based on the results of this approach, system developers can identify criticality of OS states and improve robustness of OS in those states.	0.4
Water is essential for human survival. Although approximately 71% of the world is covered in water, only 2.5% of this is fresh water; hence, fresh water is a valuable resource that must be carefully monitored and maintained. In developing countries, 80% of people are without access to potable water. Cholera is still reported in more than 50 countries. In Africa, 75% of the drinking water comes from underground sources, which makes water monitoring an issue of key concern, as water monitoring can be used to track water quality changes over time, identify existing or emerging problems, and design effective intervention programs to remedy water pollution. It is important to have detailed knowledge of potable water quality to enable proper treatment and also prevent contamination. In this article, we review methods for water quality monitoring (WQM) from traditional manual methods to more technologically advanced methods employing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for in situ WQM. In particular, we highlight recent developments in the sensor devices, data acquisition procedures, communication and network architectures, and power management schemes to maintain a long-lived operational WQM system. Finally, we discuss open issues that need to be addressed to further advance automatic WQM using WSNs.	4.4
Bioinformatics has grown very quickly for the last 20 years, and it will grow even faster in the future. One of the long-standing open challenges in bioinformatics is biomarker identification and cancer diagnosis from gene expression. In this paper, the authors propose a novel hybrid wrapper/filter feature selection approach to identify the most informative genes for cancer diagnosis, named HWF-GS. It handles selection through two steps. The first one is an iterative filter-based mechanism to generate potential subsets of genes. The second step is the aggregation of the best-selected subsets by means of a wrapper-based consensus process that relies on a particle swarm optimization adapted to feature selection. An ensemble of classifiers (SVM and KNN) is employed to evaluate the selected genes. Experiments on nine publicly available cancer DNA microarray datasets have shown that HWF-GS selects robust signatures with high classification accuracy and competes with and even outperforms other methods in the literature.	0.1
Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a promising tool for supplementing surface water and groundwater supply to overcome imbalance between water supply and demand under changing climatic conditions. The main aim of this study is to present a technically robust and pragmatic methodology for evaluating rainwater harvesting potential and identifying suitable sites for RWH and artificial recharge structures using Geographic Information System (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Unlike past studies, this study proposes an approach to prioritize zones/sites for RWH and recharge structures, which is of great importance for the effective implementation of RWH strategies. The derived themes 'runoff coefficient' and the basic themes of 'slope' and 'drainage density' were used for mapping rainwater harvesting potential. Thereafter, suitable zones and sites for feasible RWH and recharge structures were identified using suitability criteria and GIS-based Boolean logic. In addition, identified zones/sites were prioritized based on the themes of key factors viz., post-monsoon groundwater level, groundwater fluctuation and water demand. After normalizing the weights of the themes and their features, the themes were integrated in GIS environment. The study area was divided into four RWH potential zones with 47% and 38% of the study area falling under 'high' and 'moderate' RWH potential, respectively. On the other hand, the study area was classified into four rainwater harvesting demand zones namely, (a) 'very high' (29% of the study area), (b) 'high' (26.4%), (c) 'moderate' (213%), and (d) 'low' (23.6%). The zones suitable for constructing farm ponds cover 2314 km(2) and those for percolation tanks on the ground cover 42 km(2). Further, 69 sites for percolation tanks along the streams and 33 sites for check dams were also identified as suitable locations over the study area. Framework for the prioritization of suitable zones/sites for RWH and groundwater recharge is proposed in this study by integrating 'rainwater harvesting potential' and 'rainwater harvesting demand' maps. The integrated geospatial and MCDA approach is not only time saving and cost-effective but also very helpful for the efficient planning and management of rainwater at a larger scale.

Modification of classical volume balance models is one of the effective strategies to improving design of surface irrigation and optimal usage of water resources in agricultural section. In this paper, a modified volume balance model is developed to predict the advance curve in surface irrigation based on the variable actual depth at the upstream end of furrow. The simulations of the suggested structure are generated through a combination of different values of the furrow irrigation variables (inflow discharge, length of furrow, and infiltration parameters), to compare between different models and measured data. The results show that the modified volume balance is more accurate than previous equations by model efficiency of 0.94, 0.98, and 0.97 for furrow length of 60, 80, and 100 m, respectively. Sensitivity analysis is made by changing only one input parameter including discharge, field slope, roughness coefficient and infiltration parameters at a time while keeping all others fixed. Furthermore, the inflow rate can have a considerable impact on the model estimations. Nevertheless, the developed model is more sensitive to decreasing inflow discharge amount than to increasing it.

Three studies compared beliefs about natural and late blooming positive traits with those acquired through personal effort, extrinsic rewards or medicine. Young children (5-6 years), older children (8-13 years), and adults all showed a strong bias for natural and late blooming traits over acquired traits. All age groups, except 8- to 10-year-olds, treated natural and late-blooming traits as fixed essences that would persist over time and under challenging conditions. Older children and adults viewed traits acquired by intrinsic effort as more similar to natural and late-blooming traits than those acquired through bribes or medicine, suggesting that intrinsic effort itself comes to be seen as a more natural mechanism of change. A bias for the natural may therefore be an early emerging way of evaluating others that is reinforced by the ambient culture and becomes stronger with increasing age.	2.2
The 42 km of tunnels constructed using soft-ground pressure-balance tunnel-boring machines for London's new Elizabeth line were completed over a 3 year period. A single lining design solution was developed for all tunnels using a fully gasketed, steel-fibre-reinforced, concrete segmental lining suitable for use in all potential ground conditions anticipated along the alignment. The 14.8 pound billion Crossrail project faced many challenges, including dealing with significant quantities of different excavated material while minimising the environmental impact from transportation and disposal, minimising settlement effects and dealing with multiple tunnel-boring machine launches and receptions. This paper addresses how the issues were tackled and comments on the tunnel-boring machine design and the approach taken for survey control. Outline figures are also provided for the tunnelling rates. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are made based on the observations and lessons learnt during the project.	3.3
Fluid flow through micro/nanofluidics is of utmost importance in analyzing mechanical, biological and medical systems. Biological liquids are often electrolytes that produce spontaneous electrokinetic effects when flowing through pores and channels. The streaming potential which is resultant of this electrokinetic phenomenon drives the ions in the channel to move in the direction opposite to the pressure driven flow and causes a resistance against fluid flow along the channel. It is simply similar to the case when the viscosity of the fluid is slightly increased. It is expected to have a lower flow rate in the presence of the electroviscous effects; however, understanding of these effects on thermal transport characteristics would be interesting. The present study attempts to present a theoretical investigation of the electroviscous effects on heat transfer in nanofluidics based on continuum fluid mechanics while boundary slip is assumed on the walls. Results show that the presence of electroviscous effects will remarkably enhance the heat transfer rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.4
In this paper, the static and dynamic stiffness of rubber subjected to compression and shear are investigated for rubber bearing applications. For static stiffness, existing models to describe the rubber behaviors are based on linear elasticity and assumptions which may not be adequate during excessive deformation. In the first part of this paper, by modeling rubbers as hyperelastic materials and utilizing finite element analyses, key assumptions of the classic formula are first examined and the rubber behaviors in compression and shear are then simulated. It is found that the classic formula underestimates the stiffness of the rubber. In particular, for rubber with high shape factors, the compression to shear stiffness ratio could deviate considerably from the classic relation at typical working strain levels and this could significantly affect machine performance prediction and design. On the other hand, due to the viscoelastic nature, the dynamic stiffness of rubber bearings varies with working frequencies, affecting precision control. In the second part of this work, rubber pads are modeled as three-parameter general Maxwell fluids for dynamic stiffness evaluation. By combining the original rubber bearing with an additional elastic flexure or even a secondary rubber, it is possible to change the original rubber stiffness in both the compression and shear directions. Finally, designs to reduce high frequency shear stiffness or to enhance the steady state compression stiffness of rubber bearings are proposed and demonstrated.	3.3
This paper assesses the feasibility of determining key household characteristics based on temporal load profiles of household electricity demand. It is known that household characteristics, behaviours and routines drive a number of features of household electricity loads in ways which are currently not fully understood. The roll out of domestic smart meters in the UK and elsewhere could enable better understanding through the collection of high temporal resolution electricity monitoring data at the household level. Such data affords tremendous potential to invert the established relationship between household characteristics and temporal load profiles. Rather than use household characteristics as a predictor of loads, observed electricity load profiles, or indicators based on them, could instead be used to impute household characteristics. These micro level imputed characteristics could then be aggregated at the small area level to produce 'census-like' small area indicators. This work briefly reviews the nature of current and future census taking in the UK before outlining the household characteristics that are to be found in the UK census and which are also known to influence electricity load profiles. It then presents descriptive analysis of a large scale smart meter-like dataset of half-hourly domestic electricity consumption before reviewing the correlation between household attributes and electricity load profiles. The paper then reports the results of multilevel model-based analysis of these relationships. The work concludes that a number of household characteristics of the kind to be found in UK census-derived small area statistics may be predicted from particular load profile indicators. A discussion of the steps required to test and validate this approach and the wider implications for census taking is also provided. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	1.0
Inferring beliefs and social emotions of others has different neural substrates and possibly different roles in the pathophysiology of different clinical phases of schizophrenia. The current study investigated the neural basis for inferring others' beliefs and social emotions, as individual concepts, in 17 subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis (UHR), 16 patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls. Brain activity significantly differed from normal in both the left superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the schizophrenia group while inferring others' beliefs, whereas those of UHR group were in the middle of those in the schizophrenia and healthy-control groups. Brain activity during inferring others' social emotions significantly differed in both the left STS and right IFG among individuals at UHR; however, there was no significant difference in the schizophrenia group. In contrast, brain activity differed in the left IFG of those in both the schizophrenia and UHR groups while inferring social emotion. Regarding the difference in direction of the abnormality, both the UHR and schizophrenia groups were characterized by hyper-STS and hypo-IFG activations when inferring others' beliefs and emotions. These findings might reflect different aspects of the same pathophysiological process at different clinical phases of psychosis.	2.1
Resource allocation and the associated deadlock prevention problem originated in the design and the implementation of the operating systems, comprising distributed computing, parallel computing and grid computing. This paper presents an improving deadlock prevention algorithm used to schedule the policies of resource supply for resource allocation on heterogeneous distributed platform. In the current scenario, deadlock prevention algorithm using two way search method has created the problem of taking higher time complexity of O (root m) arc traversal as the edge (v,w) is added to the graph. This paper proposes the algorithms for allocating multiple resources to competing services running in virtual machines on a heterogeneous distributed platform. We have implemented and performed our algorithm proposed by using CloudSim simulator. The experiments results show that our algorithm can quickly prevent deadlock and then resolve the situation of approximately orders of magnitude in practical cases.	0.4
At birth the piglet's immune system is immature and it is dependent upon passive maternal protection until weaning. The piglet's mucosal immune system develops over the first few weeks but has not reached maturity at weaning ages which are common on commercial farms. At weaning piglets are presented with a vast and diverse range of microbial and dietary/environmental antigens. Their ability to distinguish between antigens and mount a protective response to potential pathogens and to develop tolerance to dietary antigens is critical to their survival and failure to do so is reflected in the high incidence of morbidity and mortality in the post-weaning period. A growing recognition that the widespread use of antibiotics to control infection during this critical period should be controlled has led to detailed studies of those factors which drive the development of the mucosal immune system, the role of gut microbiota in driving this process, the origin of the bacteria that colonise the young piglet's intestine and the impact of rearing environment. This review briefly describes how the mucosal immune system is equipped to respond appropriately to antigenic challenge and the programmed sequence by which it develops. The results of studies on the critical interplay between the host immune system and gut microbiota are discussed along with the effects of rearing environment. By comparing these with results from human studies on the development of allergies in children, an approach to promote an earlier maturation of the piglet immune system to resist the challenges of weaning are outlined.	5.1
An attack graph depicts multiple-step attack and provides a description of system security vulnerabilities. It illustrates critical information necessary to identify potential weaknesses and areas for enhanced defense. Attack graphs include multiple attack paths, which are a focus for further detailed analysis and risk mitigation. Considering that different vulnerabilities have different probabilities of being exploited, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically generate the top K attack paths with maximum probabilities for every node of a system. The proposed algorithm does not require generation of the full attack graph to calculate the K attack paths. Instead, it directly processes and analyzes the system input data and dynamically identifies the K attack paths. The computational time, based upon the complexity of the attack paths, can be constrained by the parameter K. Experimental results show that the algorithm is scalable and efficient.	0.2
Background and aims: While the association between health anxiety and maladaptive Internet use is a well-established finding, no studies have been performed to examine the possible effect of abnormal illness behavior (AIB). AIB is a maladaptive manner of experiencing, evaluating, or acting in response to health and illness that is disproportionate to evident pathology. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between AIB and Internet addiction (IA) severity in a sample of Italian University students. The possible effect of alexithymia, anxiety, and depression was also taken into account. Methods: Participants were 115 men and 163 women (mean age = 23.62 +/- 4.38 years); AIB was measured via the Illness Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ), and IA severity by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Results: The most powerful IBQ factor predicting IA severity scores was disease conviction. Irritability was the only emotional IBQ factor associated with IA severity. Nevertheless, disease conviction and alexithymia remained the only significant predictors of IAT scores when hierarchical regression analysis was executed. Discussion and conclusions: Our results support previous findings showing that those characterized by health anxiety are more prone to an excessive and maladaptive use of Internet. Moreover, this study showed that irritability was the only emotional aspect of AIB predicting IA severity. This finding is consistent with the cognitive model of hypochondria, which states that cognitive factors (dysfunctional beliefs and assumptions) play a major role in the explanation of this psychopathological condition.	5.0
The present study focuses on Cryptosporidium infections of foals in Brazil. A total of 92 animals of different breeds from 11 farms in the vicinity of Aracatuba in the state of Sao Paulo, were examined. According to PCR targeting the 18S rRNA gene, Cryptosporidium sp. DNA was detected in 21.7% (20/92) of foals. Good quality 18S rRNA, actin, HSP70 and gp60 genes nPCR amplicons were obtained from five fecal samples. PCR amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the GP60 sporozoite surface glycoprotein gene revealed C parvum genotypes IIaAl8G3R1, lIaAl5G2R1. Interestingly, we also detected in two foals a GP60 genotype related to the human parasite C. hominis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	6.0
The El Sancho reservoir is located in the Odiel River basin, which crosses the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The reservoir receives acid mine drainage (AMD) from the Meca River, a tributary of the Odiel River. Two multi-parameter probes, one placed at the tail (up-gradient) end of the reservoir, where the contaminants enter, and another close to the reservoir dam were used to characterize acidity migration through the Sancho reservoir. The probes both measured pH and conductivity every 30 min. Two different levels of contamination were found, due to dilution that takes place within the reservoir and changes in the AMD composition. The cross-correlation function allowed quantification of the migration process from tail to dam. For both pH and conductivity, the maximum correlation occurred 17 days after sampling, indicating a mean transit time of 17 days. Since the distance between the two sampling points was 14,500 m, the contaminant transit speed was 0.0098 m/s.	4.4
Hydraulic units are often linked to ecological habitat through geomorphic structure, and a better understanding of the turbulent characteristics of the units is needed. Our work examined the near-bed turbulent structure of runs and glides in a restored river and investigated the physical characteristics that influenced the near-bed hydraulics in these units. The research was completed in three restored reaches and one reference reach at the Virginia Tech Stream Research, Education, and Management Laboratory. The laboratory is unique because three different restoration treatments were applied contiguously along a stream, and the restoration practices ranged from passive to active. The passive reach included cattle exclusion, while the active reaches included cattle exclusion as well as vegetation plantings, bank sloping and the construction of inset floodplains. Three-dimensional velocities were measured near the channel bed in run and glide biotopes within the three restored reaches, as well as an upstream reference reach. The velocities were utilized to analyse and compare near-bed turbulent structure across the reaches. While the restoration activities did not address the channel bed directly, differences in physical structure of the two physical biotopes were observed among restoration treatments, likely because of changes in bank shape and roughness due to vegetation differences. Differences between reference and restored reaches were still evident approximately 3years after cattle exclusion and construction activities. Few differences were observed in the hydraulic structure between runs and glides, and the near-bed flow structure in both runs and glides was related to local roughness.

As the variety of new social media applications are developed at an ever-increasing rate, the number of related potential vulnerabilities and related attack vectors are also increasing. Traditionally, social engineering attacks have always been a major cause of concern for Information Security departments. However, the theft, abuse and manipulation of personal information for malicious purposes has become even prolific since the mass adoption of social media and gaming applications by the average person, largely fueled by the boom in social media and gaming applications. These newly introduced and ever-evolving apps continue to introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor system design and coding practices and have led to a multitude of sophisticated attacks and digital crimes. Attacks such as, Malware infections, ransomware, Session Hijacking, SQL Injection, and Man-in-the-Middle attacks have been facilitated in part by the race to developing social media platforms, and applications. Hence, more effective countermeasures and prevention techniques are introduced to detect and minimize the resulting damage and losses associated with this trend. This paper presents a novel 'credentials crawling' proof of concept exploit to illustrate the ease with which such attacks can be launched. The proof of concept is implemented via a stealthy application, which has been implemented (in part) using a commercial of-the-shelf application (Camera Mouse 2011). The newly developed stealth robot uses stealth techniques to conceal itself from the intended target/victim. The proposed approach enables the developed robot application to remain undetected by leading commercial anti-virus solutions. The developed robot has been tested in different environments, with various operating systems protected by various commercial antivirus solutions. The presented approach was tested on computers belonging to people from different walks of life including graduate and undergraduate students, faculty and staff (with their consent). The initial test result demonstrates that the proposed technique is effective as a tool to assist with promoting awareness against a variety of user-focused cyber-attacks especially phishing attacks.	0.4
Immunomodulatory long-term treatment has also become the standard treatment for spondyloarthritides (SpA), including psoriatic arthritis (PsA); however, uncertainty exists about dose reduction or termination of treatment after remission or low disease activity. When is it possible to reduce medication or terminate treatment for SpA? An extensive non-systematic literature search was performed focusing on practice guidelines, systematic meta-analyses and clinical trials on medicinal long-term treatment and voluntary medication reduction in axial and peripheral SpA, including PsA. The chances of drug-free remission after treatment with biologics for axial SpA and in PsA are low; however, in remission or a state of low disease activity reduction of the cumulative dosage of biologics can be successful in 53-100% of cases without a significant increase in disease activity. The current state and duration of remission, with or without comedication with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), extra-articular disease manifestations and the results of previous treatment attempts have to be carefully taken into consideration before elective dose reduction. Reduction of long-term treatment is an individualized decision made jointly by patients and physicians. The risk of flares and especially of extra-articular disease manifestations needs to be weighed against the possible advantages of reduced medication. Maintainenance of mediction-free disease remission is too rare in SpA or PsA patients carefully selected for biologics treatment, to allow a later voluntary termination of therapy, without at least a prior cautious attempt at dose reduction.	5.3
Temperature variation during semiconductor device operation can be significant and how this affects contact resistance is investigated. This paper reports improvements to analytical modeling for determining specific contact resistance (SCR) by including the effect of temperature. A technique for extracting the value of SCR using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) modeling is also demonstrated. SCR results obtained for analytical and TCAD models for metal-to-silicon contacts are compared and this shows the significance of temperature in the analyticalmodel. Small changes in electron affinity and, hence, barrier height due to changes in temperaturemust be considered in order to obtain reliable analytical expressions for SCR.	3.0
Science computing platforms are changing from traditional on-premises computing platforms to clouds. The style of research publications is also changing with the movement of open science. For example, it is common that researchers in the bioscience research community publish their research papers with the associated research data on the Internet. Furthermore, demands for reproducibility of computational experiments are increasing. A conventional method, or sharing source codes of application programs, is not enough to guarantee the reproducibility of computational experiments. In this paper, we propose overlay cloud architecture for building virtual clouds on cloud platforms. In the proposed architecture, the middle-ware, Virtual Cloud Provider (VCP), automatically configures computing environments (application programs, operating systems, libraries and binaries) that is required to reproduce computing results by using the Linux container technology. VCP also deploys containers of computing environments on clouds and configures overlay network connecting the deployed containers. A case study which considers DNA sequencing software shows how the VCP can be deployed, and used to reproduce results.	0.4
Three studies examined if people express negative implicit attitudes toward individuals with a tattoo near the face. In Study 1, participants who completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) expressed moderately negative implicit attitudes toward individuals with a tribal tattoo on one side of the neck. Study 2 replicated Study 1 when the tattoo was symmetrical, suggesting that negative affect, and not processing fluency, underlies the implicit negative evaluation of individuals with a tribal tattoo near the face. Study 3 showed dissociation between explicit and implicit attitudes toward individuals with a tribal tattoo near the face, and that the negative implicit evaluation was attenuated if the tattoo image was an objectively positive symbol. The implications for displaying a tattoo near the face are discussed.	2.0
In this paper the integrated implementation of the Manufacturing Engineering subject in all new engineering degrees at the University of Malaga is analyzed, within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) framework. After identifying the methodology used by Department of Engineering Manufacturing Process and the problems generated in its development, the robustness of the designed organization system is justified. This methodology has successfully overcome the negative effects of multiple changes made to the delivery of the first edition of this subject. Additionally, the methodology developed has generating a significant level of student satisfaction by comparison with near departments and overall university.	3.2
Background:Postdecompressive craniotomy defect management following failed prior cranioplastyis challenging. The authors describe a staged technique utilizing free muscle transfer, tissue expansion, and custom polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants for the management of previously failed cranioplasty sites in patients with complicating local factors.Methods:Consecutive patients with previously failed cranioplasties following large decompressive craniectomies underwent reconstruction of skull and soft tissue defects with staged free latissimus muscle transfer, tissue expansion, and placement of custom computer-aided design and modeling PEEK implants with a temporalis-plus modification to minimize temporal hollowing. Implants were placed in a vascularized pocket at the third stage by elevating a plane between the previously transferred latissimus superficial fascia (left on the skin) and muscle (left on the dura/bone). Patients were evaluated postoperatively for cranioplasty durability, aesthetic outcome, and complications.Results:Six patients with an average of 1.6 previously failed cranioplasties underwent this staged technique. Average age was 33 years. Average defect size was 139 cm(2). Average time to procedure series completion was 14.9 months. There were no flap failures. One patient had early postoperative incisional dehiscence following PEEK implant placement that was managed by immediate scalp flap readvancement. At 21.9 month average follow-up, there were no cranioplasty failures. Three patients (50%) underwent 4 subsequent refining outpatient procedures. All patients achieved complete coverage of their craniectomy defect site with hear-bearing skin, acceptable head shape, and normalized head contour.Conclusions:The described technique resulted in aesthetic, durable craniectomy defect reconstruction with retention of native hear-bearing scalp skin in a challenging patient population.	3.0
The manufacturing engineering work in nine Japanese firms is structured by a horizontal division of labor between manufacturing design engineers and production process engineers, in contrast to a vertical division of labor between manufacturing engineers and technicians in three American firms. The production process engineers in the Japanese firms link manufacturing engineering processes closely with production processes, whereas less coordination between the two processes occurs in the American firms. Regarding product design, manufacturing engineering, and production processes in the Japanese firms, employees engaged in downstream processes are more heavily involved with work concerned with upstream processes than in the American firms.	3.2
Objective. To conduct a replication study and meta-analysis involving the study of mtDNA variants in the radiographic progression of OA in different cohorts worldwide, including Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK), the OA Initiative and a cohort from Spain. Methods. The influence of the haplogroups in the rate of radiographic progression at 96 months in 431 subjects from CHECK was assessed in terms of Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade. Progression was defined as a change from KL >= 1 at baseline to any higher grade during the follow-up. Extended Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the influence of mtDNA variants in the rate of radiographic knee OA progression. A subsequent meta-analysis of 1603 subjects following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was conducted to combine the data of individual studies. A sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the stability of the results. Results. CHECK subjects carrying the haplogroup T showed the lowest rate of radiographic knee OA progression [hazard ratio (HR) 0.645 (95% CI 0.419, 0.978); P < 0.05]. When pooled, subjects within the superhaplogroup JT showed the same trend [HR 0.707 (95% CI 0.501, 0.965); P < 0.05]. BMI [HR 1.046 (95% CI 1.018, 1.073); P < 0.05] and bilateral OA [HR 2.266 (95% CI 1.733, 2.954); P < 0.05] at baseline are risk factors for radiographic knee OA progression as well. In the meta-analysis there was a reduced rate of radiographic progression in subjects with haplogroup T [HR 0.612 (95% CI 0.454, 0.824); P = 0.001] or in the superhaplogroup JT [HR 0.765 (95% CI 0.624, 0.938); P = 0.009]. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were robust. Conclusion. The mtDNA variants in the superhaplogroup JT associate with a reduced rate of radiographic OA progression. The mtDNA polymorphisms in the superhaplogroup JT emerge as potential complementary genetic biomarkers for disease progression.	6.0
Here, I suggest that colour polymorphic study systems have been underutilized to answer general questions about evolutionary processes, such as morph frequency dynamics between generations and population divergence in morph frequencies. Colour polymorphisms can be used to study fundamental evolutionary processes like frequency-dependent selection, gene flow, recombination and correlational selection for adaptive character combinations. However, many previous studies of colour polymorphism often suffer from weak connections to population genetic theory. I argue that too much focus has been directed towards noticeable visual traits (colour) at the expense of understanding the evolutionary processes shaping genetic variation and covariation associated with polymorphisms in general. There is thus no need for a specific evolutionary theory for colour polymorphisms beyond the general theory of the maintenance of polymorphisms in spatially or temporally variable environments or through positive or negative frequency-dependent selection. I outline an integrative research programme incorporating these processes and suggest some fruitful avenues in future investigations of colour polymorphisms.	6.4
The relationship between contaminated drinking water with trace elements and thyroid diseases hypertension, liver functions disorder and kidney functions disorder was studied in this research. The thyroid diseases hypertension, liver functions disorder and kidney functions disorder are due to contaminant drinking water with trace elements. The present study concerned with water toxicity. The heavy metals belonging to the most important pollutants. A strong relationship between contaminated drinking water with heavy metals from some of the stations of water shopping in Hail, KSA and thyroid diseases hypertension, liver functions disorder and kidney functions disorder has been identified in this study. These diseases are apparently related to contaminant drinking water with heavy metals such as Pb, Cd, Cu, Mo, Zn, Ni, Mn, Co and Cr. kidney functions disorder is related to contaminate drinking water with lead and cadmium, liver functions disorder to copper and molybdenum, and thyroid functions disorder to iodide, copper, and cadmium. Long-term exposure to lead, cadmium, zinc, iron, and arsenic in drinking-water is mainly related to primarily in the form of thyroid, liver, and kidney functions disorder. Studies of these diseases suggest that abnormal incidence in specific areas is related to toxic materials in the groundwater and thereby led to the contamination of drinking water in these areas. The result of this study showed that increase in the thyroid hormones, and liver functions test as AST and ALT enzymes. Also, there were increase in the hypertension and kidney functions test as creatinine and uric acid. These increases due to the pollution of drinking water by heavy metals.	4.4
Hand gestures are a form of nonverbal communication, which allow a person to communicate a range of thoughts and feelings with or without speech. Here MEMS 3 axis accelerometer to detect the input gestures as X, Y, Z direction. The axis is to detect the four types of gesture, which includes up, down, left, right. The hand motion of data collected will directly send to the microcontroller to run on a PC with the help of wireless module. Thedata will compressed by different users, gesture to extract from sign sequence and template matching. A single gesture has contain an 8 numbers code. This code reduces the hundreds of data values in single gesture and also to compare with the stored templates. In this paper three models has introduced and discussed about its accuracy. The sequence of gesture contain 85 experiments, finally the results achieves an overall accuracy of 96% based on the sign sequence generation and template matching, this each recognitioncontains the ranging from 94% to 100%.	2.3
W. Horsley Gantt and Joseph V. Brady laid a rich foundation for understanding the concept of emotion, derived from 2 prominent traditions of physiology and psychology: classic conditioning and operant conditioning, respectively. This framework guided my fierce interest in motivation in general and the interaction between reward and stress, which began at John Hopkins with my thesis work under the guidance of Drs. Zoltan Annau, Solomon Synder, and Joseph Brady, among many others. Using the study of the neurobiology of addiction as a framework, I argue that drug addiction not only involves positive reinforcement associated with the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse but also involves another major source of reinforcement, specifically negative reinforcement driven by negative emotional states (termed the dark side of addiction). Excessive activation of the brain reward systems leads to antireward or a decrease in the function of normal reward-related neurocircuitry and persistent recruitment of the brain stress systems, both of which may be neurobiologically linked. Understanding the neuroplasticity of the neurocircuitry that comprises the negative reinforcement associated with addiction is a key to understanding negative emotional states in general and their pathophysiology.	5.0
This work proposes a Digitally Enhanced Low-Drop Out Voltage Regulator (DE-LDO) for Ultra High Radio Frequency IDentification (UHF RFID) passive tags. The DE-LDO design approach is based on the Finite State Machine (FSM) nature of the tag Digital Control. Injecting part of the FSM unconsumed current into LDO loop to enhance transient response, a more flat output voltage is obtained. Chip measurements shows that DE-LDO consumes a quiescent current of 600 nA at 1.6V, delivering an output current and voltage of 8 mu A and 1.2V; a 69.76% Power Efficiency (PE) is observed. Circuit design and fabrication were performed using 0.50 mu m CMOS technology.	1.4
In the steel industry, the iron making system deals with large quantities of materials and energy and so it can play a critical role in reducing emissions and production costs. More specifically, excess by-product gases should be used for electricity generation; otherwise, they lead to pollution. A life cycle analysis is performed to compare the environmental impact of an iron making system with a combined cycle power plant (CCPP), to a system producing the same amount of electricity in a coal power plant. The results for a Chinese steel plant show a 33% reduction in the energy conservation and emission reduction potential for the CCPP system, which is thus more environmentally friendly. A mathematical programming formulation is then proposed for optimal scheduling. It incorporates key technological constraints and is sensitive to hourly changing electricity prices. The outcome is a 19% increase in revenue from electricity sales compared to a schedule that does not dynamically adjust to the price profile. The results also show that emissions from by-product gases can be avoided completely. The paper ends with a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of changes in product demand, gas storage and CCPP capacity, and emission cost.	1.0
This paper details the design, development and evaluation of an affective tutoring system (ATS)-an e-learning system that detects and responds to the emotional states of the learner. Research into the development of ATS is an active and relatively new field, with many studies demonstrating promising results. However, there is often no practical way to apply these findings in real-world settings. The ATS described in this paper utilizes a generic affective application model to infer and appropriately respond to the learner's affective state. This approach brings several advantages, notably the potential direct support for re-use and retrospective addition of affect sensing functionality into existing e-learning software. Skin conductivity and heart rate variability measurements were used to infer affective activation and valence. The evaluation involved an experiment in which the effectiveness of the fully functional ATS was compared with that of a nonaffective version, and was conducted with 40 adult participants. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this tutoring system showed that measurable improvements in perceived learning may be obtained with a modest level of software development.	6.4
Emotional processing (EP) is a complex cognitive function necessary to successfully adjust to social environments where we need to interpret and respond to cues that convey threat or reward signals. Ex-combatants have consistently shown atypical EP as well as poor social interactions. Available reintegration programs aim to facilitate the re-adaptation of ex-combatants to their communities. However, they do not incorporate actions to improve EP and to enhance cognitive-emotional regulation. The present study was aimed at evaluating the usefulness of an intervention focused on Social Cognitive Training (SCT), which was designed to equip ex-combatants enrolled in the Social Reintegration Route with EP and social cognition skills. A group of 31 ex-combatants (mean age of 37.2, 29 men) from Colombian illegal armed groups were recruited into this study. Of these, 16 were invited to take part in a SCT and the other continued with the conventional reintegration intervention. Both groups underwent 12 training sessions in a period 12-14 weeks. They were assessed with a comprehensive protocol which included Psychosocial, Behavioral, and Emotion Processing instruments. The scores on these instruments prior to and after the intervention were compared within and between groups. Both groups were matched at baseline. Ex-combatants receiving the SCT experienced significant improvements in EP and a reduction in aggressive attitudes, effects not observed in those continuing the conventional reintegration intervention. This is the first study that achieves such outcomes in such a population using SCT intervention. We discuss the implications of such results toward better social reintegration strategies.	2.1
Hospitals have multiple data sources, such as embedded systems, monitors and sensors. The number of data available is increasing and the information are used not only to care the patient but also to assist the decision processes. The introduction of intelligent environments in health care institutions has been adopted due their ability to provide useful information for health professionals, either in helping to identify prognosis or also to understand patient condition. Behind of this concept arises this Intelligent System to track patient condition (e.g. critic events) in health care. This system has the great advantage of being adaptable to the environment and user needs. The system is focused in identifying critic events from data streaming (e.g. vital signs and ventilation) which is particularly valuable for understanding the patient's condition. This work aims to demonstrate the process of creating an intelligent system capable of operating in a real environment using streaming data provided by ventilators and vital signs monitors. Its development is important to the physician because becomes possible crossing multiple variables in real-time by analyzing if a value is critic or not and if their variation has or not clinical importance.	4.0
Submerged aquatic vegetation affects flow, sediment and ecological processes within rivers. Quantifying these effects is key to effective river management. Despite a wealth of research into vegetated flows, the detailed flow characteristics around real plants in natural channels are still poorly understood. Here we present a new methodology for representing vegetation patches within computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of vegetated channels. Vegetation is represented using a Mass Flux Scaling Algorithm (MFSA) and drag term within the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes Equations, which account for the mass and momentum effects of the vegetation, respectively. The model is applied using three different grid resolutions (0.2, 0.1 and 0.05m) using time-averaged solution methods and compared to field data. The results show that the model reproduces the complex spatial flow heterogeneity within the channel and that increasing the resolution leads to enhanced model accuracy. Future applications of the model to the prediction of channel roughness, sedimentation and key eco-hydraulic variables are presented, likely to be valuable for informing effective river management.

Background: All implant compounds undergo an electrochemical process when in contact with biological fluids, as well as mechanical corrosion due to abrasive wear, with production of metal debris that may inhibit repair processes. None of the commonly-used methods can diagnose implant allergies when used singly, therefore a panel of tests should be performed on allergic patients as pre-operative screening, or when a postoperative metal sensitisation is suspected. Methods: We analysed patients with painful prostheses and subjects prone to allergies using the Patch Test in comparison with the Lymphocyte Transformation Test. Cytokine production was evaluated to identify prognostic markers for early diagnosis of aseptic loosening. Metal debris endocytosis and cytoskeletal rearrangement was visualised by confocal microscopy. Results: Our results demonstrate that the Lymphocyte Transformation Test can identify patients who have a predisposition to develop allergic reactions and can confirm the diagnosis of hypersensitivity in patients with painful prostheses. The prevalence of a Th2-cytokine pattern may be used to identify predisposition to the development of allergic diseases, while the selective presence of osteoclastogenic cytokines may be used as predictor of a negative outcome in patients with painful prosthesis. The hypothesis of the prognostic value of these cytokines as early markers of aseptic loosening is attractive, but its confirmation would require extensive testing. Conclusions: The Lymphocyte Transformation Test is the most suitable method for testing systemic allergies. We suggest that the combined use of the Patch Test and the Lymphocyte Transformation Test, associated with cytokine detection in selected patients, could provide a useful tool for preventive evaluation of immune reactivity in patients undergoing primary joint replacement surgery, and for clinical monitoring of the possible onset of a metal sensitization in patients with implanted devices.	5.1
Background. Contact allergy to rubber additives is common, particularly in patients with occupational dermatitis. Objectives. To descriptively analyse and compare patch test reactions in patients patch tested both with the baseline series and with an additional 'rubber series' as used in the department. Methods. Patch test data from those members of the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergies (ESSCA) network (www.essca-dc.org) who also contributed data on rubber series patch test results were retrospectively analysed. Results. Among 29 522 patients patch tested, 2870 were eligible, that is, patch tested both with the baseline series and with a special rubber series. Of these, 8.8% had positive reaction(s) to one of the baseline screening rubber allergens (as compared with 4.2% in all patients), most often to carba mix, 12.3% had positive reaction(s) to allergens from an additional rubber series, and 6.4% had positive reaction(s) to both. Conclusions. Additional testing with a dedicated rubber series, containing break-down single ingredients of mixes from the baseline series and additional rubber allergens, is warranted in patients with suspected contact allergy to rubber, to avoid false-negative results.	5.1
The disease progression of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) from childhood into adulthood is unclear. To determine the clinical outcome of patients who were diagnosed with EoE as children, and who now are young adults. Children (= 18 years old) were identified, and a structured telephone interview was conducted to obtain follow-up data on symptom prevalence (dysphagia to solids and liquids, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and heartburn/regurgitation), food impaction, medication usage, health-care utilization, and resolution of atopy/food allergies. A favorable outcome was defined if EoE symptoms were resolved or improved by subjects' assessment. Unfavorable outcomes was defined as symptoms same or worse. Clinical variables that predicted a favorable outcome as an adult were examined. Mayo Dysphagia Scale (MDQ-30: scored 0-100) was administered to validate the outcome assessment. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio and unpaired t-test were used. Fifty-eight subjects (64% male) who met study criteria were enrolled. Mean age at diagnosis was 12 years (range 4-17) and mean duration of follow-up was 8.3 years (2-16). As children, the most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (54%), dysphagia (33%), and vomiting (24%). As young adults, 47 subjects (81%) had a favorable outcome. Total MDQ-30 scores were 4.6 (0-30) and 14.1 (0-50) in subjects with favorable outcome and unfavorable outcome, respectively (P= 0.015). Two-thirds of subjects did not use steroids or proton pump inhibitors in the preceeding 12 months. Male children with EoE were four times more likely to have a favorable outcome as young adults compared with female children. Females were more likely to report nausea/vomiting as young adults (odds ratio 3.23, CI 0.97-10.60). Of all presenting symptoms in EoE children, dysphagia was the most likely to persist into adulthood (odds ratio 6.29, CI 1.85-21.38). Eighty one percent of EoE children had a favorable outcome as young adults. Most patients with symptom resolution did not require any form of steroid therapy or seek healthcare.	5.1
In recent years, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) has attracted increased attention within the advanced technology industry in an effort to modernize and develop a more intelligent and reliable information system. Technologies to detect a specific object in images are expected to further expand to wide range of applications, such as car detection functions for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and other systems. Computer vision and pattern recognition are emerging fast and will continue to grow together with local feature detection methods. In this paper, we propose an object detection and tracking system which is based on Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speed Up Robust Features (SURF) feature extraction methods. From the evaluation results, we observe that the accuracy of matched keypoints of SURF algorithm are higher than SIFT.	4.0
With location-based social network (LBSN) flourishing, location check-in records offer us sufficient information resource to do relative mining. Among locations visited by a user, those attracting relatively more visits from that user can serve as a support for further mining and improvement for location-based services. Therefore, great significance lies in the partition for visited locations based on a user's visiting frequency. The aim of our paper is to partition locations for individual users by utilizing classification in machine learning, categorizing the location for a user once he or she makes initial check-in there. After feature extraction for each initial check-in record, we evaluate the contribution of three feature categories. The results show the contribution of different feature categories varies in classification, where social features appear to offer the least contribution. At last, we do a final test on the whole sample, comparing the results with two baselines based on majority voting respectively. The results largely outperform the baselines in general, demonstrating the effectiveness of classification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
Many patients with atopic syndrome complain of symptoms related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as well. Symptoms caused by asthmatic condition or rhinitis are well known to the patients. There are well defined therapeutic strategies on how to handle the cases, well known to the patients. The cause of symptoms under IBS is unclear and many patients undergo many diagnostic procedures including invasive investigations. Quality of life (QOL) is reduced in such patients and they suffer a lot. Psychic disorders like depression and anxiety may occur. At the end of the Odyssey, food allergies are tested. Patients pay for laboratory tests for specific IgG4 antibodies or alternatively basophile activation tests (BAT) for food incompatibilities offered on online-platforms. In this article, causes of IBS through mast cell activation and not necessarily food allergies are discussed. How does mast cell activation lead to lactose, fructose and histamine intolerance? What are the similarities between Asthma and IBS? Is a similar therapeutic approach feasible?	5.1
In this study, we describe the construction of the first genetically modified mutant of a halovirus infecting haloalkaliphilic Archaea. By random choice, we targeted ORF79, a currently uncharacterized viral gene of the haloalkaliphilic virus phi Ch1. We used a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated transformation method to deliver a disruption cassette into a lysogenic strain of the haloalkaliphilic archaeon Natrialba magadii bearing phi Ch1 as a provirus. This approach yielded mutant virus particles carrying a disrupted version of ORF79. Disruption of ORF79 did not influence morphology of the mature virions. The mutant virus was able to infect cured strains of N. magadii, resulting in a lysogenic, ORF79-disrupted strain. Analysis of this strain carrying the mutant virus revealed a repressor function of ORF79. In the absence of gp79, onset of lysis and expression of viral proteins occurred prematurely compared to their timing in the wild-type strain. Constitutive expression of ORF79 in a cured strain of N. magadii reduced the plating efficiency of phi Ch1 by seven orders of magnitude. Overexpression of ORF79 in a lysogenic strain of N. magadii resulted in an inhibition of lysis and total absence of viral proteins as well as viral progeny. In further experiments, gp79 directly regulated the expression of the tail fiber protein ORF34 but did not influence the methyltransferase gene ORF94. Further, we describe the establishment of an inducible promoter for in vivo studies in N. magadii. IMPORTANCE Genetic analyses of haloalkaliphilic Archaea or haloviruses are only rarely reported. Therefore, only little insight into the in vivo roles of proteins and their functions has been gained so far. We used a reverse genetics approach to identify the function of a yet undescribed gene of phi Ch1. We provide evidence that gp79, a currently unknown protein of phi Ch1, acts as a repressor protein of the viral life cycle, affecting the transition from the lysogenic to the lytic state of the virus. Thus, repressor genes in other haloviruses could be identified by sequence homologies to gp79 in the future. Moreover, we describe the use of an inducible promoter of N. magadii. Our work provides valuable tools for the identification of other unknown viral genes by our approach as well as for functional studies of proteins by inducible expression.	6.4
Whey proteins, due to their high nutritional value, are generally hydrolyzed to reduce the allergenicity and used as ingredients in many special products, such as infant formulae, geriatric products, highly energetic supplements or dietetic foods or in foods produced to prevent nutrition related diseases, like food intolerances and allergies. The aim of this work was to assess the applicability of innovative technologies, such as high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processes, to assist the enzymatic hydrolysis of target proteins, namely whey protein concentrate (WPC-80), in order to modify their antigenicity. Experiments were carried out to verify the effectiveness of HHP technology to accelerate whey protein hydrolysis reaction with selected enzymes (a-chymotrypsin, bromelain), and to affect the protein allergenic power. To this purpose, different HHP treatments were carried out at several pressure levels (100, 200, 300 and 400 MPa) and the untreated whey protein samples were used as control. A defined enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/10 w/w was used in the experiments, while the treatment time was changed from 0 to 30 min (0, 5, 15, or 30 min). The experimental data demonstrated that High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) induced WPC-80 unfolding at the highest value of the pressure applied (400 MPa) as indicated by the higher exposure of free sulfhydryl groups. When HHP was used in combination with enzymatic hydrolysis, the degree of hydrolysis increased not only with the pressure level applied but also with the processing time. These results suggested that, even if the exposure of hidden epitopes upon protein unfolding increased the antigenicity of whey proteins, further peptide bonds cleavage also took place after hydrolysis. This effect could modify whey proteins antigenic sequences, and thus their antigenic power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.1
As originally shown by King and Altman, graph theory, and specifically the use of spanning trees, provides the means to solve the kinetics of any catalytic network in a steady state regime, taking as input data all the rate constants. Herein, it is shown that the translation of the rate constants to Gibbs energies provides a simpler way to estimate the energy span (i.e., the apparent activation energy of the full reaction), the determining states, and the turnover frequency (TOF) of any and all catalytic networks. By re-examining the concepts of chemical kinetics through rigorous mathematical treatment, an alternative definition is suggested for the term chemical mechanism. In addition, and in analogy to electrical circuits, the chemical resistor terms (called here kinestors) are identified for parallel and series chemical circuits, providing a new Ohmic interpretation for catalysis.	1.2
Background and aims: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) imposes a potential public health threat worldwide. Gaming motives are potentially salient factors of IGD, but research on Chinese gaming motives is scarce. This study empirically evaluated the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire (C-MOGQ), the first inventory that measures seven different gaming motives applicable to all type of online games. We also investigated the associations between various gaming motives and IGD symptoms among Chinese gamers. Methods: Three hundred and eighty-three Chinese adult online gamers (Mean age = 23.7 years) voluntarily completed our online, anonymous survey in December 2015. Results: The confirmatory factor analysis results supported a bi-factor model with a general factor subsuming all C-MOGQ items (General Motivation) and seven uncorrelated domain-specific factors (Escape, Coping, Fantasy, Skill Development, Recreation, Competition, and Social). High internal consistencies of the overall scale and subscales were observed. The criterion-related validity of this Chinese version was also supported by the positive correlations of C-MOGQ scale scores with psychological need satisfaction and time spent gaming. Furthermore, we found that high General Motivation (coupled with high Escape motive and low Skill Development motive) was associated with more IGD symptoms reported by our Chinese participants. Discussion and conclusions: Our findings demonstrated the utility of C-MOGQ in measuring gaming motives of Chinese online gamers, and we recommend the consideration of both its total score and subscale scores in future studies.	5.0
The impact of childhood maltreatment effects can extend beyond the immediate stress of abusive family environments. College students (N = 435) exposed to childhood domestic violence or parental physical abuse were expected to be viewed less favorably by their peers than their nonabused counterparts. They were expected as well to be less accurate in predicting the first impressions left on their peers after 25-minute unstructured interactions. Partial support was found for both hypotheses. Relatively harsher (d = .49) peer first impressions were found among domestic violence witnesses. Domestic violence (d = .58) and parental physical abuse (d = .49) victims overestimated peer ratings. Social anxiety during peer interactions was higher among women exposed to either form of childhood maltreatment. Men from violent families viewed themselves less favorably than their peers (r = .22, p < .05). These results further implicate childhood maltreatment as a contributing factor in peer distancing and rejection.	2.2
Green roofs are gaining momentum in the arid and semi-arid regions due to their multiple benefits as compared with conventional roofs. One of the most critical steps in green roof installation is the selection of drought and heat tolerant species that can thrive under extreme microclimate conditions. We monitored the water status, growth and survival of 11 drought-adapted shrub species grown on shallow green roof modules (10 and 13 cm deep substrate) and analyzed traits enabling plants to cope with drought (symplastic and apoplastic resistance) and heat stress (root membrane stability). The physiological traits conferring efficiency/safety to the water transport system under severe drought influenced plant water status and represent good predictors of both plant water use and growth rates over green roofs. Moreover, our data suggest that high substrate temperature represents a stress factor affecting plant survival to a larger extent than drought per se. In fact, the major cause influencing seedling survival on shallow substrates was the species-specific root resistance to heat, a single and easy measurable trait that should be integrated into the methodological framework for screening and selection of suitable shrub species for roof greening in the Mediterranean.

The paper studies the case of water pollution in Sweden, and how the city of Gothenburg had to struggle with this issue in order to secure a source of fresh water to satisfy its demand for drinking water. It is argued in the paper that the city employed a wide variety of strategies, ranging from water treatment to acquiring property rights over the watershed that provides its water. Most importantly, the city was interested in reducing the levels of pollution in the river, and consequently became a key stakeholder in the enforcement and implementation of effective environmental legislation.	4.4
Background: Up to 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have a history of traumatic events, which is associated with greater episode severity, higher risk of comorbidity and higher relapse rates. Trauma-focused treatment strategies for BD are thus necessary but studies are currently scarce. The aim of this study is to examine whether Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy focusing on adherence, insight, de-idealisation of manic symptoms, prodromal symptoms and mood stabilization can reduce episode severity and relapse rates and increase cognitive performance and functioning in patients with BD. Methods/ design: This is a single-blind, randomized controlled, multicentre trial in which 82 patients with BD and a history of traumatic events will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of two treatment arms: EMDR therapy or supportive therapy. Patients in both groups will receive 20 psychotherapeutic sessions, 60 min each, during 6 months. The primary outcome is a reduction of affective episodes after 12 and 24 months in favour of the EMDR group. As secondary outcome we postulate a greater reduction in affective symptoms in the EMDR group (as measured by the Bipolar Depression Rating Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impression Scale modified for BD), and a better performance in cognitive state, social cognition and functioning (as measured by the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry, The Mayer-SaloveyCaruso Emotional Intelligence Test and the Functioning Assessment Short Test, respectively). Traumatic events will be evaluated by The Holmes-Rahe Life Stress Inventory, the Clinician-administered PTSD Scale and the Impact of Event Scale. Discussion: The results of this study will provide evidence whether a specific EMDR protocol for patients with BD is effective in reducing affective episodes, affective symptoms and functional, cognitive and trauma	2.1
The present study investigates the relative extent to which judgments of people's behavior are influenced by truth (as measured by averaged observer-judgments) and by systematic bias (i.e., perceivers' preexisting views of target persons). Using data from online questionnaires and laboratory sessions (N = 155), we demonstrate that self- and peer-judgments of people's actual behavior in specific situations are somewhat accurate but are also affected by what perceivers thought of the targets before observing their behavior. The latter effect comprises a general evaluative component (generally positive or negative views of targets) and a content-specific component (views of targets in terms of specific characteristics, for example, restrained). We also found that friends, but not targets themselves, tend to judge targets' behaviors more positively than unacquainted observers do. The relevance of these findings for person perception in everyday life and in research contexts is discussed.	2.2
Domain Name System (DNS) traffic has become a rich source of information from a security perspective. However, the volume of DNS traffic has been skyrocketing, such that security analyzers experience difficulties in collecting, retrieving, and analyzing the DNS traffic in response to modern Internet threats. More precisely, much of the research relating to DNS has been negatively affected by the dramatic increase in the number of queries and domains. This phenomenon has necessitated a scalable approach, which is not dependent on the volume of DNS traffic. In this paper, we introduce a fast and scalable approach, called PsyBoG, for detecting malicious behavior within large volumes of DNS traffic. PsyBoG leverages a signal processing technique, power spectral density (PSD) analysis, to discover the major frequencies resulting from the periodic DNS queries of botnets. The PSD analysis allows us to detect sophisticated botnets regardless of their evasive techniques, sporadic behavior, and even normal users' traffic. Furthermore, our method allows us to deal with large-scale DNS data by only utilizing the timing information of query generation regardless of the number of queries and domains. Finally, PsyBoG discovers groups of hosts which show similar patterns of malicious behavior. PsyBoG was evaluated by conducting experiments with two different data sets, namely DNS traces generated by real maiware in controlled environments and a large number of real-world DNS traces collected from a recursive DNS server, an authoritative DNS server, and Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers. We utilized the maiware traces as the ground truth, and, as a result, PsyBoG performed with a detection accuracy of 95%. By using a large number of DNS traces, we were able to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of PsyBoG in terms of practical usage. Finally, PsyBoG detected 23 unknown and 26 known botnet groups with 0.1% false positives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.2
To perform a joint analysis of multivariate neuroimaging phenotypes and candidate genetic markers obtained from longitudinal studies, we develop a Bayesian longitudinal low-rank regression (L2R2) model. The L2R2 model integrates three key methodologies: a low-rank matrix for approximating the high-dimensional regression coefficient matrices corresponding to the genetic main effects and their interactions with time, penalized splines for characterizing the overall time effect, and a sparse factor analysis model coupled with random effects for capturing within-subject spatio-temporal correlations of longitudinal phenotypes. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulations show that the L2R2 model outperforms several other competing methods. We apply the L2R2 model to investigate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the top 10 and top 40 previously reported Alzheimer disease associated genes. We also identify associations between the interactions of these SNPs with patient age and the tissue volumes of 93 regions of interest from patients' brain images obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.	5.2
Ageing and lifespan are strongly affected by metabolism. The maximal possible uptake of oxygen is not only a good predictor of performance in endurance sports, but also of life expectancy. Figuratively speaking, healthy ageing is a competitive sport. Although the root cause of ageing is damage to macromolecules, it is the balance with repair processes that is decisive. Reduced or intermittent nutrition, hormones and intracellular signalling pathways that regulate metabolism have strong effects on ageing. Homeostatic regulatory processes tend to keep the environment of the cells within relatively narrowbounds. On the other hand, the body is constantly adapting to physical activity and food consumption. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and other processes indicate youth and health. A (homeo) dynamic aspect of homeostasis deteriorates with age. We are now in a position to develop computational models of human metabolism and the dynamics of heart rhythm and oxygen transport that will advance our understanding of ageing. Computational modelling of the connections between dietary restriction, metabolism and protein turnover may increase insight into homeostasis of the proteins in our body. In this way, the computational reconstruction of human physiological processes, the Physiome, can help prevent frailty and age-related disease.	6.2
Holistic farming systems provide designs for the whole farm that make long term sustainable use of nutrients, water, labour, finances and energy. In using organic residues to produce energy, and safely recycling the digested residues back into the farming system, a biogas digester could be a central component of many holistic systems. This paper discusses the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural constraints on the use of biogas digesters in holistic farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In higher altitude areas where maintenance of optimal temperature can constrain anaerobic digestion, floating drum or fixed dome digesters are a better option than flexible balloon digesters because they are less susceptible to temperature changes. If water is a key constraint, rainwater harvesting could be used to reduce the additional labour needed to collect water. If energy is the most limiting resource in the farming system, the optimum use of organic residues might be as a fuel for anaerobic digestion, whereas, if water is limiting, energy production by burning or pyrolysis might be a better option. The bioslurry from anaerobic digestion can be used in fish ponds to produce plankton to feed fish, and can be applied to fertile fields and fields of intermediate fertility, while biochar from pyrolysis is better used to improve the soil in infertile fields. If labour is limiting, it is particularly important that the system design minimises any additional labour needed to process the organic residues on a daily basis, considering trade-offs between labour and other resources.

Beginning in infancy, before a diagnosis is made, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show significant impairments in the foundation for social-communication interactions including eye gaze in the contexts of both requesting and joint attention (JA). Addressing these early impairments as early as possible in toddlers who receive the diagnosis of ASD provides them with a foundational social-communication repertoire necessary for learning. In this study we examined the effects of a social-communication intervention involving prompting and reinforcement to teach gaze shift (GS; shifting gaze from an object to the interventionist's eyes) in the context of responding to a request and initiating JA to four toddlers with ASD. Intervention lasted 3-9 weeks with all toddlers demonstrating GS to mastery across both contexts. Toddlers also showed generalization to a repertoire of social-communication behavior, including initiating requests and increases in smiling. Some improvements in symptoms of ASD and overall functioning were observed. Results suggest a promising brief intervention to address the earliest form of social communication that remains a part of successful social-communication interactions throughout life.	2.3
It was recently shown that Austrians associate car front geometry with traits in a way that could be related to face shape geometry mapping to those same overall suites of traits. Yet, possible confounding effects of familiarity with the car models, media coverage and entertainment could not be ruled out. In order to address this, the current study uses a cross-cultural comparison. Adult subjects in two countries (Austria and Ethiopia, n=129) were asked to rate person characteristics of 46 standardized front views of automobiles on various trait scales. These two countries differ substantially with regard to their experience with car models and brands, as well as car marketing and media coverage. Geometric morphometrics was then used to assess the shape information underlying trait attribution. Car shapes for perceived maturity, maleness and dominance were highly similar in both countries, with patterns comparable to shape changes during facial growth in humans: Relative sizes of the forehead and windshield decrease with age/growth, eyes and headlights both become more slit-like, noses and grilles bigger, lips and air-intakes are wider. Austrian participants further attributed various degrees of some interpersonal attitudes and emotions, whereas neither Austrians nor Ethiopians congruently ascribed personalities. Morphological correlates of personal characteristics are discussed, as are person perception and its overgeneralization to inanimate objects. Cross-cultural similarities and differences are addressed, as well as implications for car styling, follow-up studies on driving and pedestrian behavior, and fundamental dimensions in inference from (human) faces.

In recent decades, China has been facing serious water pollution crises. To address this problem, discharge standards for wastewater treatment plants in China are becoming more and more stringent. Also, the sewage charge for compliant emissions and the penalty rate for non-compliant emissions have increased significantly. This paper comprehensively investigates the economic and environmental implications of such wastewater management policy in China. In this paper, a general framework for the analysis of WWTPs' behavior and the resulted economic and environmental consequences is presented, and the impacts of discharge standard, charge rate, and penalty rate are analyzed. The trade-offs-between the operational cost, environmental impact, and pollutant emissions are identified. This study also provides some insightful management implications for concerned policy makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.4
Hypergraph is a powerful representation for several computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition problems. In the last decade, many researchers have been keen to develop different hypergraph models. In contrast, no much attention has been paid to the design of hyperedge weighting schemes. However, many studies on pairwise graphs showed that the choice of edge weight can significantly influence the performances of such graph algorithms. We argue that this also applies to hypergraphs. hi this paper, we empirically study the influence of hyperedge weights on hypergraph learning via proposing three novel hyperedge weighting schemes from the perspectives of geometry, multivariate statistical analysis, and linear regression. Extensive experiments on ORL, COIL20, JAFFE, Sheffield, Scenel 5 and Caltech256 datasets verified our hypothesis for both classification and clustering problems. For each of these claSses of problems, our empirical study concludes with suggesting a suitable hypergraph weighting scheme. Moreover, the experiments also demonstrate that the combinations of such weighting schemes and conventional hyper graph models can achieve competitive classification and clustering performances in comparison with some recent state-of-the-art algorithms.

The cross hybrid (XS) concept has been demonstrated experimentally with 3.3-kV Si Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBTs) and SiC MOSFETs in parallel, and used to calibrate 2D Technology Computer Aided Design simulations. The XS hybrid offers lower switching losses compared with full Si IGBTs and reduced oscillations compared with full SiC MOSFETs. The current sharing mechanism between the IGBT and the MOSFET in the XS hybrid has been elucidated, showing that under typical switching conditions, the IGBT dissipate 98% of the XS hybrid turn-OFF losses compared with the SiC MOSFET. Since the current density of the IGBT in the XS hybrid is twice of that of the full IGBT solution, it exhibits higher dynamic avalanche. These features results in stress at device and package level, thereby compromising robustness and reliability. In order to overcome such issues, we show that increasing the turn-OFF gate resistance improves current sharing in the XS hybrid by delaying the turn-OFF of the MOSFET, and thereby suppressing dynamic avalanche in the IGBT.	3.0
Although age-related deficits in emotion perception have been established using photographs of individuals, the extension of these findings to dynamic displays and dyads is just beginning. Similarly, most eye-tracking research in the person perception literature, including those that study age differences, have focused on individual attributes gleaned from static images; to our knowledge, no previous research has considered cue use in dyadic judgments with eye-tracking. The current study employed a Brunswikian lens model analysis in conjunction with eye-tracking measurements to study age differences in the judgment of rapport, a social construct comprised of mutual attentiveness, positive feelings, and coordination between interacting partners. Judgment accuracy and cue utilization of younger (n = 47) and older (n = 46) adults were operationalized as correlations between a perceiver's judgments and criterion values within a set of 34 brief interaction videos in which 2 opposite sex college students discussed a controversial topic. No age differences emerged in the accuracy of judgments; however, pathways to accuracy differed by age: Younger adults' judgments relied on some behavioral cues more than older adults. In addition, eye-tracking analyses revealed that older adults spent more time looking at the bodies of the targets in the videos, whereas younger adults spent more time looking at the targets' heads. The contributions from both the lens model and eye-tracking findings provide distinct but complementary insights to our understanding of age-related continuities and shifts in social perceptual processing.	2.2
This paper presents a comparative study of two different FSCW PM machines for application as integrated motor-generator in hybrid vehicles. The first machine design contains the conventional concentrated winding with q=0.5 that is recently used in many hybrid systems for commercial vehicles, whereas the second machine use the new 18-teeth/10-poles concentrated winding with the optimized magneto motive force. Design and analysis of considered machines is based on their performances which included evaluation of electromagnetic torque and torque ripples, Ohmic losses, magnet losses, field weakening capability, noise analysis, and temperature behaviour. Using 2D and 3D finite elements the both machine types are investigated and compared under the same geometrical and electromagnetic constrains. Considering the main electromagnetic and thermal aspects, the new machine show high power capability and efficiency, low torque ripple, low magnet losses, noiseless design, and thermally robust.	3.3
Purpose: The major problem in producing artificial livers is that primary hepatocytes cannot be cultured for many days. Recently, 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology draws attention and this technology regarded as a useful tool for current cell biology. By using the 3D bio-printing, these problems can be resolved. Methods: To generate 3D bio-printed structures (25 mm x 25 mm), cells-alginate constructs were fabricated by 3D bio-printing system. Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of 6-8 weeks old mice by a 2-step collagenase method. Samples of 4 x 10(7) hepatocytes with 80%-90% viability were printed with 3% alginate solution, and cultured with well-defined culture medium for primary hepatocytes. To confirm functional ability of hepatocytes cultured on 3D alginate scaffold, we conducted quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence with hepatic marker genes. Results: Isolated primary hepatocytes were printed with alginate. The 3D printed hepatocytes remained alive for 14 days. Gene expression levels of Albumin, HNF-4 alpha and Foxa3 were gradually increased in the 3D structures. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the primary hepatocytes produced hepatic-specific proteins over the same period of time. Conclusion: Our research indicates that 3D bio-printing technique can be used for long-term culture of primary hepatocytes. It can therefore be used for drug screening and as a potential method of producing artificial livers.	6.1
To enable a prosperous Internet of Things (IoT), devices and services must be extensible and adapt to changes in the environment or user interaction patterns. These requirements manifest as a set of design principles for each of the layers in an IoT ecosystem, from hardware to cloud services. This paper gives concrete guidelines learned from implementing and deploying a full-stack synergistic IoT platform. We address hardware design concerns and present a reference platform, Firestorm. Upon this platform, we demonstrate firmware and personal-area networking concerns and solutions. Moving out towards larger scales we address local service discovery and syndication, and show how these principles carry through to global operation where security concerns dominate.	0.4
Prior research indicates that there may be a disharmonious relationship between positive attitudes toward ethnic and cultural diversity and social identity within a socially dominant group. Recent work in cultural psychology, however, has implied that this disharmonious relationship may be confined to a specific representation of social identity. This research examined this possibility. Study 1 (N = 51,238) found that the negative association between national identity and diversity attitudes found among participants from Western societies did not extend to participants from non-Western societies. Study 2 (N = 222) recruited American and Japanese participants, disentangled two distinct representations of their social identitycollective and relational social identityand found their differential associations with positive attitudes toward multiculturalism. Implications are discussed.	2.0
Electricity generators of varying capacities are popularly utilized in Nigeria as alternative source of power owing to the unreliability of electricity supply through the national grid. This study evaluated the impact of emissions from generating sets on air quality and human health in selected areas of Abeokuta city, Nigeria. The levels of particulates (PM1, PM3), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and methane were monitored using portable samplers. Copies of questionnaire were administered to generator operators and nearby residents so as to collect additional information. The capacities of sampled generators ranged from 1 to 25 kVA. The range of mean concentrations of PM1 (4.7-219.2 mu g/m(3)), PM3 (7.8-251.6 mu g/m(3)), carbon dioxide (4.5-10.9%), methane (0.0-1.2 ppm), carbon monoxide (141.1-4167.0 ppm), NOx (4.0-85.7 ppm), methane (2.3-31.0 ppm), sulphur oxides (3.5-65.6 ppm) and hydrogen sulphide (0.0-0.7 ppm) was highest at generator sites. The distance of sample sites to generator locations accounted for 14-66% variation of pollutants levels. Ailments frequently suffered by the exposed residents included nasal congestion (66%), cough (33%), headache (24%) and fever (12%). A national policy on appropriate use of electricity generator is urgently needed in Nigeria.	1.0
iHOME is a monitoring system that aims to help caregivers take care of their elderly. The main module of the HOPE system provides an intelligent ambient environment by employing prediction based on elderly's daily activity monitor. The goal of iHOME is for non-invasively monitor the elderly behavior pattern and to notify the caregiver upon abnormality detection such as fall detection in the their movement pattern. This enhances the safety of the elderly so that he/she could live independently. The technology behind this includes Arduino-based ambient sensors, tracking based sensors, Case-Based Reasoning prediction algorithm and Pebble wearable application.	4.0
In this paper, we present a Finite pointset method (FPM) for the numerical simulation of free surface flow around a ship in calm water. It is a Lagrangian and meshless particle scheme which is applied to the projection method for the incompressible governing equations. This requires the solution of Poisson problems in each time step, so a moving least squares (MLS) interpolants is used for the spatial derivatives in order to discretize the Poisson equation with pressure-Dirichlet condition of free surface flow in meshless structure. Meanwhile, an additional problem of the periodic particle locations redistribution in the present approach is still handled by MLS interpolants. With the proposed FPM technique, problems associated with the free surface flow around a ship are circumvented. A verification of numerical modeling is made using the Wigley hull and the validity of the proposed methodology is examined by comparing the detail of wave profile and wave-making resistance with Series 60 model. The results demonstrate that FPM is able to perform efficient and stable simulations of free surface flow around a ship.	3.4
The control of Rhipicephalus microplus is essential to prevent cattle discomfort and economic losses. However, increased resistance and acaricides inefficiency lead producers to adopt strategies that could result in the accumulation of chemical residues in meat and milk with possibilities of poisoning in animals and people. This scenario demonstrates the necessity of research into the identification of novel, effective and environmentally safe therapeutic options for cattle tick control. The objectives of this study were to develop and assess the efficacy of R. microplus biotherapic and of 5% eugenol for the control of R. microplus in artificially infested calves. Eighteen male 6-month-old Holstein calves were divided into three groups of six animals. In Group 1, the animals did not receive medication (control group); in Group 2, the animals received 1 mL of R. microplus biotherapic at dilution 6CH (centesimal Hahnemannian), orally administered twice daily. And in Group 3, they received a single application of eugenol 5% in the pour-on formulation. The median efficacy for biotherapy and eugenol 5% was respectively 10.13 and 13.97%; however, upon analyzing reproductive efficiency, it is noteworthy that the biotherapic had 45.86% efficiency and was superior to the action of eugenol (12.03%) after 37 days of treatment. The ultrastructural study provided information about the effects of R. microplus biotherapic on the ovaries of engorged females and showed disorganization in the deposition of the oocyte exochorion. The results suggest hatchability inhibition of larvae, interference in R. microplus reproduction and future possibilities for eco-friendly control of R. microplus with biotherapic 6CH.	6.3
Magnetic force spectroscopy is a rapidly developing single molecule technique that has found numerous applications at the interface of physics and biology. Since the invention of the first magnetic tweezers, a number of modifications to the approach have helped to relieve the limitations of the original design while amplifying its strengths. Inventive molecular biology solutions further advanced the technique by expanding its possible applications. In its present form, the method can be applied to both single molecules and live cells without resorting to intense irradiation, can be easily multiplexed, accommodates multiple DNAs, displays impressive resolution, and allows a remarkable ease in the stretching and twisting of macromolecules. In this review, we describe the architecture of magnetic tweezers, key requirements for experimental design and analysis of data, and outline several applications of the method that illustrate its versatility.	6.0
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with a variety of potential biotechnological applications is still isolated from the horseradish root as a mixture of different isoenzymes with different biochemical properties. There is an increasing demand for preparations of high amounts of pure enzyme but its recombinant production is limited because of the lack of glycosylation in Escherichia coli and different glycosylation patterns in yeasts which affects its stability parameters. The goal of this study was to increase the stability of non-glycosylated enzyme, which is produced in E. coli, toward hydrogen peroxide via mutagenesis. Asparagine 268, one of the N-glycosylation sites of the enzyme, has been mutated via saturation mutagenesis using the megaprimer method. Modification and miniaturization of previously described protocols enabled screening of a library propagated in E. coli XJb (DE3). The library of mutants was screened for stability toward hydrogen peroxide with azinobis (ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as a reducing substrate. Asn268Gly mutant, the top variant from the screening, exhibited 18-fold increased stability toward hydrogen peroxide and twice improved thermal stability compared with the recombinant HRP. Moreover, the substitution led to 2.5-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency with phenol/4-aminoantipyrine. Constructed mutant represents a stable biocatalyst, which may find use in medical diagnostics, biosensing, and bioprocesses. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Background: This study examined whether acutely (aMDD) and remitted depressed patients (rMDD) show deficits in the two aspects of social cognition - facial emotion recognition (FER) and reasoning - when using ecologically valid material. Furthermore, we examined whether reduced facial mimicry mediates the association between depressive symptoms and FER, and whether FER deficits and reasoning deficits are associated. Method: In 42 aMDD, 43 rMDD, and 39 healthy controls (HC) FER was assessed using stimuli from the Amsterdam Dynamic Facial Expression Set, reasoning by the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition. Furthermore, the activity of Zygomaticus Major and Corrugator supercilii were recorded. Results: aMDD recognized happy faces less accurately, were less confident recognizing happiness and anger and found it more difficult to recognize happiness, anger and fear than HC. rMDD were less confident recognizing anger and found it more difficult to recognize happiness, anger and fear than HC. Reduced mimicry did not explain FER deficits. aMDD but not rMDD showed impaired reasoning. Limitations: The stimulus material was comparably easy to decode. Therefore, it is possible that the FER deficits of aMDD and rMDD patients are more pronounced than demonstrated in this study. Conclusions: aMDD show deficits in FER and reasoning, whereas rMDD only show mild impairments in the recognition of emotional expressions. There must be other processes - besides mimicry - that serve the accurate recognition of emotional facial expressions.	2.1
This paper presents analytical methods to calculate the equivalent circuit parameters for large-scale brushless doubly fed machines (BDFMs) with magnetic wedges utilized for closing stator open slots. The use of magnetic wedges reduces the magnetizing currents in the machine, reflected in the values of magnetizing inductances, but also increases leakage fluxes affecting the value of series inductances in the equivalent circuit. Though such effects can be modeled by numerical models, the proposed analytical methods are particularly helpful in optimizing machine design, inverter rating, reactive power management, and grid low-voltage ride-through performance. The conventional analytical methods cannot be readily applied to the BDFM due to its complex magnetic field distribution; this paper presents analytical methods to calculate the magnetizing and leakage inductances for the BDFM with magnetic wedges used in the stator slots. The proposed methods are assessed by experimentally verified finite-element models for a 250 kW BDFM.	3.3
This paper reveals that nearly 25 years after the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) I Committee (1972) used Russell's dose-rate data to support the adoption of the linear-no-threshold (LNT) dose response model for genetic and cancer risk assessment, Russell acknowledged a significant under-reporting of the mutation rate of the historical control group. This error, which was unknown to BEIR I, had profound implications, leading it to incorrectly adopt the LNT model, which was a decision that profoundly changed the course of risk assessment for radiation and chemicals to the present.	6.4
Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common neurodegenerative condition associated with dementia. To learn more about genetic risk of HS-Aging pathology, we tested gene-based associations of the GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2 genes, which were reported to be associated with HS-Aging pathology in previous studies. Genetic data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium, linked to autopsy-derived neuropathological outcomes from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Of the 3251 subjects included in the study, 271 (8.3%) were identified as an HS-Aging case. The significant gene-based association between the ABCC9 gene and HS-Aging appeared to be driven by a region in which a significant haplotype-based association was found. We tested this haplotype as an expression quantitative trait locus using 2 different public-access brain gene expression databases. The HS-Aging pathology protective ABCC9 haplotype was associated with decreased ABCC9 expression, indicating a possible toxic gain of function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
Flexible bed sills are extensively used in rivers in several applications: to protect pipeline crossings, for slope control and to enhance environmental aspects. Use of riprap provides the flexibility required to adjust to small changes in river bed level and makes this material one of the most commonly used. Shear failure of riprap has been extensively studied, but little knowledge is available on edge failure of flexible bed sills and on the design of the required extent of sills to protect assets. Experimental work in a large test facility was carried out to gain improved understanding of flat sills and sills protruding above the bed. Significantly lower depth and length of the scour hole were observed at the downstream edge of flat riprap sills than at rigid sills. Existing equations for rigid bed sills were found not to be appropriate for estimating scour at the flexible bed sills tested. As expected, protrusion enhances scour potential significantly: it was found that scour depths were of the order of 100% or greater than those associated with flat sills. The research has provided useful evidence for avoiding placement of pipelines straight on to river beds and instead to adopt trenches whenever feasible.	3.1
We propose a short and reliable instrument, based on pre-existing items, for measuring the three dimensions of religion as end, means, and quest. Starting from the 47 items originally included in the Religious Orientation Scale (ROS; Allport & Ross, 1967) and in the Religious Life Inventory (RLI; Batson, Schoenrade, & Ventis, 1993), we performed four steps of analyses involving three independent samples of Italian Catholic respondents (total N = 1194). Through a process of progressive refinement, using exploratory factor analyses, an investigation of the meaning of the items, and confirmatory factor analyses, we eventually selected 18 items from the pre-existing scales, recombined in the Religious Life and Orientation Scale. We report initial evidence of the psychometric qualities of the proposed instrument and analyze its correspondence with the parent scales. Future research should investigate the properties of the scale with respondents from other countries and belonging to other religions.	2.0

Authors often convey meaning by referring to or imitating prior works of literature, a process that creates complex networks of literary relationships (intertextuality) and contributes to cultural evolution. In this paper, we use techniques from stylometry and machine learning to address subjective literary critical questions about Latin literature, a corpus marked by an extraordinary concentration of intertextuality. Our work, which we term quantitative criticism, focuses on case studies involving two influential Roman authors, the playwright Seneca and the historian Livy. We find that four plays related to but distinct from Seneca's main writings are differentiated from the rest of the corpus by subtle but important stylistic features. We offer literary interpretations of the significance of these anomalies, providing quantitative data in support of hypotheses about the use of unusual formal features and the interplay between sound and meaning. The second part of the paper describes a machine-learning approach to the identification and analysis of citational material that Livy loosely appropriated from earlier sources. We extend our approach to map the stylistic topography of Latin prose, identifying the writings of Caesar and his near-contemporary Livy as an inflection point in the development of Latin prose style. In total, our results reflect the integration of computational and humanistic methods to investigate a diverse range of literary questions.	0.1
Within the diagnostic process, in the activities in which digital radiology systems are utilised, image display devices play a very important role. Such devices have to guarantee high performances in order to maintain the diagnostic quality of the displayed images and present them so that they can be observed optimally. In order to ensure the appropriate performance to the users, not only the image display device but also the whole workstation should be designed properly. Particular attention should be paid to the lighting conditions, to avoid compromising the radiologist's ability to observe the displayed images. The aim of this study is to assess the lighting of some workstations used for diagnostic radiology reporting, in order to obtain information about the visual interaction between worker and device and prevent health risks. A detailed analysis of the lighting of adjustable and nonadjustable workstations used for diagnostic radiology reporting was carried out in different rooms of the Radiology Department at the Felice Lotti Hospital in Pontedera (Pisa, Italy). The analysis was carried out thanks to in situ measurements (objective analysis) and the submission of an evaluation questionnaire to a sample composed by 16 radiologists (subjective analysis). From the obtained results it has been possible to point out that, in nonadjustable workstations the absence of a dedicated lighting system very often reveals the inadequacy of the general lighting in guaranteeing correct lighting conditions for the radiologists during the reading of the diagnostic monitors. As measure to reduce the visual fatigue of the radiologists, the use of a supplementary adjustable innovative LED backlight system was proposed. The use of the LED backlight system allows complying the requirements of the Technical Standards and mitigate the difference of luminance in the field of view of the radiologist. Due to that the use of the LED backlight system has been positively perceived by the examined sample, a significant part of whom has ascribed to this use a reduction in the visual fatigue.

Background: Advances in the nucleic acid sequencing technologies have ushered in the era of genetic-based precision medicine. Applications of the genetic discoveries to practice of medicine, however, are hindered by phenotypic variability of the genetic variants. The report illustrates extreme pleiotropic phenotypes associated with an established causal mutation for hereditary cardiomyopathy. Case presentation: We report a 61-year old white female who presented with syncope and echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging findings consistent with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The electrocardiogram, however, showed a QRS pattern resembling an Epsilon wave, a feature of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Whole exome sequencing (mean depth of coverage of exons 178X) analysis did not identify a pathogenic variant in the known HCM genes but identified an established causal mutation for ARVC. The mutation involves a canonical splice accepter site (c.2146-1G >C) in the PKP2 gene, which encodes plakophillin 2. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation. PKP2 is the most common causal gene for ARVC but has not been implicated in HCM. Findings on echocardiography and CMR during the course of 4-year follow up showed septal hypertrophy and a hyperdynamic left ventricle, consistent with the diagnosis of HCM. However, neither baseline nor follow up echocardiography and CMR studies showed evidence of ARVC. The right ventricle was normal in size, thickness, and function and there was no evidence of fibro-fatty infiltration in the myocardium. Conclusions: The patient carries an established pathogenic mutation for ARVC and a subtle finding of ARVC but exhibits the classic phenotype of HCM, a contrasting phenotype to ARVC. The case illustrates the need for detailed phenotypic characterization for patients with hereditary cardiomyopathies as well as the challenges physicians face in applying the genetic discoveries in practicing genetic-based precision medicine.	6.4
Denitrification beds are being used to reduce the transport of water-soluble nitrate via subsurface drainage systems to surface water. Only recently has the non-linearity of water flow through woodchips been ascertained. To successfully design and model denitrification beds with optimum nitrate removal, a better understanding of flow in denitrification beds is needed. The main objectives of this study were to characterize the hydraulic properties of old degraded woodchips and provide a better understanding of the factors affecting flow. To achieve this goal, we conducted constant-head column experiments using old woodchips that were excavated from a four-year old denitrification bed near Willmar, Minnesota, USA. For Izbash's equation, the non-Darcy exponent (n) ranged from 0.76 to 0.87 that indicates post-linear regime, and the permeability coefficient (M-10) at 10 degrees C ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 cm s(-1). For Forchheimer's equation, the intrinsic permeability of 5.6 x 10(-5) cm(2) and omega constant of 0.40 (at drainable porosity of 0.41) closely resembled the in-situ properties found in a previous study. Forchheimer's equation was better than that of Izbash's for describing water flow through old woodchips, and the coefficients of the former provided stronger correlations with drainable porosity. The strong correlation between intrinsic permeability and drainable porosity showed that woodchip compaction is an important factor affecting water flow through woodchips. Furthermore, we demonstrated the importance of temperature effects on woodchip hydraulics. In conclusion, the hydraulic properties of old woodchips should be characterized using a non-Darcy equation to help design efficient systems with optimum nitrate removal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Scholars have been increasingly interested in how everyday interactions in various places with people from different ethnic/religious background impact inter-group relations. Drawing on representative surveys in Leeds and Warsaw (2012), we examine whether encounters with ethnic and religious minorities in different type of space are associated with more tolerance towards them. We find that in Leeds, more favourable affective attitudes are associated with contact in institutional spaces (workplace and study places) and socialisation spaces (social clubs, voluntary groups, religious meeting places); however, in case of behavioural intentions operationalised as willingness to be friendly to minority neighbours only encounters in socialisation spaces play a significant role in prejudice reduction. In Warsaw, people who have contacts with ethnic and religious minorities in public (streets, park, public services and transport) and consumption spaces (cafes, pubs, restaurants) express more positive affective attitudes towards them, but only encounters in consumption space translate into willingness to be friendly to minority neighbours.

The evolution of the human eye's unique high contrast morphology allows people to communicate with a simple look. Yet overt looking is not always preferred in social situations. Do covert shifts in attention - those that occur without a concomitant shift of the eyes or head - support this need? In the present field study, we discretely recorded pedestrians' looks to a confederate who performed an action - raising his hand to the side of his head and saying 'Hey' into a phone (private action), or raising his hand to the side of his head in greeting (i.e. a static wave) and saying 'Hey' (public action). Critically, pedestrians were not looking at the confederate at the start of the action. Despite this, pedestrians looked more in response to the public action (wave) than private action (phone). We argue that the observed difference in looking responses must be due to pedestrians first attending to the confederate covertly in order to assess the intention of his action, and only signaling this attention with a look when socially appropriate (e.g. to respond to a public action). Though the functional utility of covert attention has rarely been considered outside of controlled laboratory tasks, these results provide the first demonstration that covert attention plays a critical role in guiding appropriate social looking behaviour.

Due to the ever-increasing efficiency of computer systems, symmetric cryptosystem are becoming more vulnerable to linear cryptanalysis brute force attacks. For example, DES with its short key (56 bits) is becoming easier to break, while AES has a much longer key size (up to 256 bits), which makes it very difficult to crack using even the most advanced dedicated cryptanalysis computers. However, more complex algorithms, which exhibit better confusion and diffusion characteristics, are always required. Such algorithms must have stronger resistance against differential and linear cryptanalysis attacks. This paper describes the development of an algorithm that implements a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) in order to increase the key generation complexity. Experimental results on both DES and AES cryptosystems complemented with the PRNG have shown an average improvement of up to 36.3% in the avalanche error computation over the original standard systems, which is a considerable improvement in the time complexity of both systems.	0.3
Voltage is one of the most fundamental concepts in electrical engineering, but nevertheless has been shown to be a difficult concept for many students. To help address those difficulties, we designed a tutorial worksheet similar to those published by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington. In this activity, students were introduced to electric potential and compared and contrasted it to voltage. As electric potential and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law are closely related, we assumed learning about potential would help students gain a better qualitative understanding of voltage. Post-test and exam data from an introductory circuits course show that after the tutorial many students still had difficulties with voltage and potential. More than three quarters of the responses concerning voltage and potential were inconsistent. This suggests that most students were unable to link those two concepts. We therefore conclude that potential and voltage remain conceptually very different for students in their learning process. As tutorial worksheets have proved to be very effective in students overcoming conceptual difficulties, it is likely that there are specific difficulties with these concepts that have not yet been identified.	1.3
Precise cell positioning is indispensable in the fields of biophysics and cellular biology. Acoustic microbeam produced by a highly focused ultrasound transducer has recently been investigated for a particle or cell manipulation. By virtue of the relatively good piezoelectric property, Sc doped AIN film was introduced for a highly focused ultrasound transducer application. Using a sputtering approach, a self focused AIScN film based device has been designed, fabricated, and characterized at a frequency of' similar to 230 MHz. It had a narrow lateral beam width (similar to 8.2 mu m). The AIScN ultrasound transducer was not only shown to be capable of remote controlling a single 10 mu m polystyrene microsphere in distilled water, but also demonstrated to possess the capability to manipulate without contact individual 10 mu m epidermoid carcinoma cell in two dimensions within a range of hundreds of micrometers in phosphate buffered saline. Most importantly, the cell manipulation was realized in continuous mode and no switch-on and -off operation was needed. These results suggest that self-focused AIScN film ultrasound transducer is a promising candidate for biomedical and molecular biology applications.	6.0
The Internet of Things (IoT) is projected to soon interconnect tens of billions of new devices, in large part also connected to the Internet. IoT devices include both high-end devices which can use traditional go-to operating systems (OSs) such as Linux, and low-end devices which cannot, due to stringent resource constraints, e.g., very limited memory, computational power, and power supply. However, large-scale IoT software development, deployment, and maintenance requires an appropriate OS to build upon. In this paper, we thus analyze in detail the specific requirements that an OS should satisfy to run on low-end IoT devices, and we survey applicable OSs, focusing on candidates that could become an equivalent of Linux for such devices, i.e., a one-size-fits-most, open source OS for low-end IoT devices.	0.4
As an important regulator of pollutants in overland flow and interflow, land use has become an essential research component for determining the relationships between surface water quality and pollution sources. This study investigated the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to identify the impact of land use and population density on surface water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China. A manual variable excluding-selecting method was explored to resolve multicollinearity issues. Standard regression coefficient analysis coupled with cluster analysis was introduced to determine which variable had the greatest influence on water quality. Results showed that: (1) Impact of land use on water quality varied with spatial and seasonal scales. Both positive and negative effects for certain land-use indicators were found in different subcatchments. (2) Urban land was the dominant factor influencing N, P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in highly urbanized regions, but the relationship was weak as the pollutants were mainly from point sources. Agricultural land was the primary factor influencing N and P in suburban and rural areas; the relationship was strong as the pollutants were mainly from agricultural surface runoff. Subcatchments located in suburban areas were identified with urban land as the primary influencing factor during the wet season while agricultural land was identified as a more prevalent influencing factor during the dry season. (3) Adjusted R-2 values in OLS models using the manual variable excluding-selecting method averaged 14.3% higher than using stepwise multiple linear regressions. However, the corresponding GWR models had adjusted R-2 similar to 59.2% higher than the optimal OLS models, confirming that GWR models demonstrated better prediction accuracy. Based on our findings, water resource protection policies should consider site-specific land-use conditions within each watershed to optimize mitigation strategies for contrasting land-use characteristics and seasonal variations.

In intensive agricultural systems, such as Mediterranean greenhouses, monitoring soil nutrient and salt status is essential for optimising vegetable production and minimising soil and water pollution. This work analyses the dynamics of electrical conductivity (ECss) and nutrient concentration in soil solution collected simultaneously with various zero-tension lysimeters and a suction cup (a tension lysimeter) throughout two greenhouse tomato crops. The ECss obtained with zero-tension lysimeters (funnel and plate lysimeter) was generally lower than that with the suction cup, irrespective of soil depth. Moreover, the soil solution concentration of potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride and sulphate obtained with funnel lysimeter (FullStop (TM)) was generally lower than that with suction cup throughout both cycles, while no clear differences were found for the nitrate concentration at 0.25 m depth in the 2013/14 cycle or at 0.38 m depth in the 2015 one. Overall, it appears that the soil solutions collected with the suction cup and the funnel lysimeter represent different soil solution status and processes. The funnel lysimeter collects freely draining soil solution, and it may therefore provide better information about the movement of elements between soil horizons, whereas the suction cup can sample soil solution from soil pores with longer residence times, especially under unsaturated flow conditions, and might represent better the available element concentrations for plant nutrition studies. The differential response found for nitrate could be due to the fact that it is a very mobile element within the soil. The soil water matric potential was slightly higher in the soil with zero-tension lysimeters throughout most of the 2013/14 cycle, and so these devices might alter soil solution movement and water and nutrient availability. On the other hand, in general, a good fit was found between the soil solution concentration of nitrate, potassium, calcium and sodium measured with a rapid analysis system (Laqua (TM)) and that measured using the reference laboratory method. This rapid system, in combination with the suction cup, can facilitate the farmers' control of soil nutrient and salt status. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.4
Objectives: Group-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy of children with aggressive behavior has resulted in significant reductions of behavior problems with small to medium effect sizes. We report the efficacy of an individualized Treatment Program for Children with Aggressive Behavior. Method: A within-subject design with two phases (waiting, treatment) was chosen. Sixty boys aged 6-12 years with peer-related aggressive behavior were included. The course of the outcome measures (growth rates) during a 6-week waiting phase was compared with those in the subsequent treatment phase (24 weekly child sessions together with an average of 8 parent contacts) by multilevel modeling. Primary outcome was peer-related aggressive behavior rated by parents. Further outcome measures included parent ratings and patient self-reports of aggressive and prosocial behavior. Results: During the treatment, growth rates for all parent-rated outcome measures were significant (p<.001) and comparison with the waiting phase indicated a stronger decrease in aggressive behavior and a stronger increase in prosocial behavior. For all self-rated outcome measures, growth rates during the treatment were significant (p<.01), but comparison with the waiting phase indicated a stronger decrease only for disturbance of social interaction. Conclusions: The treatment program is an effective intervention for children with peer-related aggressive behavior.	2.4
Control of the LCL-type three-phase grid-connected converter is difficult due to high resonance peak of the LCL filter. Active damping is the state-of-the-art solution to this problem, but the damping performance will be affected by the inherent time delay of digital control, especially for high-power low switching frequency applications. Based on a discrete-time stability analysis of an LCL-type converter with capacitor-current-feedback active damping, a simple and effective time delay compensation method, which is based on area equalization concept, is proposed. The method can reduce the negative impact of the computation delay significantly. It has the potential to serve as a general solution to time delay compensation of a digitally controlled PWM converter. The validity of the proposed method is proved by experimental results.	1.4
Rainwater tanks often provide a reliable and affordable water supply source in rural and remote areas where piped water supply systems are unfeasible due to economic considerations. However, over recent decades there has been an increase in the adoption of rainwater harvesting as part of the water supply source mix in modern cities. The uptake of rainwater harvesting has been influenced by the rise of ecological sustainable development as a mainstream practice. Rainwater harvesting is now implemented as part of an integrated urban water management approach to alleviate pressure on traditional water supply sources due to increased demand, driven by the rapid growth of urbanised populations. While examples of rainwater harvesting in human settlements can be found since ancient times, there are still gaps in understanding the role that it can play in modern cities. This paper reviews current international experiences with rainwater harvesting, particularly examining the drivers for their adoption in different urban contexts and the impediments faced for greater mainstream adoption. The paper then reviews the current state of research associated with understanding the value of rainwater harvesting in modern cities, which include impacts on reducing mains water demand, public health risks, energy implications, environmental impacts, and cost-effectiveness.	4.3
Polymeric heart valves (PHV) can be engineered to serve as alternatives for existing prosthetic valves due to higher durability and hemodynamics similar to bioprosthetic valves. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of geometry on PHVs coaptation and hemodynamic performance. The two geometric factors considered are stent profile and leaflet arch length, which were varied across six valve configurations. Three models were created with height to diameter ratio of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.88. The other three models were designed by altering arch height to stent diameter ratio, to be 0, 0.081, and 0.116. Particle image velocimetry experiments were conducted on each PHV to characterize velocity, vorticity, turbulent characteristics, effective orifice area, and regurgitant fraction. This study revealed that the presence of arches as well as higher stent profile reduced regurgitant flow down to 5%, while peak systole downstream velocity reduced to 58% and Reynolds Shear Stress values reduced 40%. Further, earlier reattachment of the forward flow jet was observed in PHVs with leaflet arches. These findings indicate that although both geometric factors help diminish the commissural gap during diastole, leaflet arches induce a larger jet opening, yielding to earlier flow reattachment and lower energy dissipation.	3.4
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are vital for normal growth and development and physiological function of various tissues in humans. PUFAs have immunomodulatory actions in addition to their ability to modulate inflammation, vascular reactivity, neurotransmission and stem cell biology. PUFAs and their metabolites possess both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that underlie their actions and involvement in several diseases. Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), possesses both cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory action and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4 {(called as epi-lipoxin A4, aspirin-triggered lipoxins (ATLs))}. In addition, at low doses aspirin may not interfere with the production of prostacyclin (PGI2). Both lipoxin A4 and PGI2 have vasodilator, platelet anti-aggregator and anti-inflammatory actions that may underlie the beneficial actions of aspirin. Paradoxically, other NSAIDs may not have the same actions as that of aspirin on PUFA metabolism. Similar anti-inflammatory compounds are formed from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by the action of aspirin termed as resolvins (from EPA and DHA) and protectins and maresins from DHA. PUFAs: arachidonic acid (AA), EPA and DHA and their various products modulate not only inflammation and immune response but also possess actions on various genes, nuclear factors, cyclic AMP and GMP, G-protein coupled receptors (GPRs), hypothalamic neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines and enzymes, and interact with nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide to regulate their formation and action and to form new compounds that have several biological actions. These pleiotropic actions of PUFAs and their metabolites may explain their ability to play a role in several physiological actions and diseases. The big challenge is to harness these actions to prevent and manage clinical conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	6.1
The abuse of the psychostimulant methamphetamine (MA) is associated with substantial costs and limited treatment options. To understand the mechanisms that lead to abuse, animal models of voluntary drug intake are crucial. We aimed to develop a protocol to study long-term non-invasive voluntary intake of MA in mice. Mice were maintained in their home cages and allowed daily 1 h access to an attached tunnel leading to a test chamber in which nebulized MA was available. Restated, if they went to the nebulizing chamber, they self-administered MA by inhalation. This protocol was compared to injected and to imposed exposure to nebulized MA, in a series of seven experiments. We established a concentration of nebulized MA at which motor activity increases following voluntary intake resembled that following MA injection and imposed inhalation. We found that mice regulated their exposure to MA, self-administering for shorter durations when concentrations of nebulized MA were increased. Mice acquire the available MA by repeatedly running in and out of the nebulizing chamber for brief bouts of intake. Such exposure to nebulized MA elevated plasma MA levels. There was limited evidence of sensitization of locomotor activity. Finally, blocking access to the wheel did not affect time spent in the nebulizing chamber. We conclude that administration of MA by nebulization is an effective route of self-administration, and our new protocol represents a promising tool for examining the transitions from first intake to long-term use and its behavioral and neural consequences in a non-invasive protocol.	5.0
Objective: To examine the effectiveness of 2 affect recognition interventions (Faces and Stories) in people with a traumatic brain injury. Setting: Postacute rehabilitation facilities. Participants: A total of 203 participants with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury were screened; 71 were eligible and randomized to the Faces (n = 24), Stories (n = 23), and Control interventions (n = 24). Participants were an average of 39.8 years of age and 10.3 years postinjury; 74% of participants were male. Design: Randomized controlled trial with immediate, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up posttests. Interventions were 9 hours of computer-based training with a therapist. Measures: Diagnostic Assessment of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Adult Faces; Emotional Inference From Stories Test; Empathy (Interpersonal Reactivity Index); and Irritability and Aggression (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). Results: The Faces Intervention did significantly better than the Control Intervention on the Diagnostic Assessment of Nonverbal Accuracy 2-Adult Faces (P = .031) posttreatment; no time effect or group interaction was observed. No other significant differences were noted for the Faces Intervention. No significant differences were observed between the Stories and the Control Interventions; however, a significant time effect was found for the Emotional Inference From Stories Test. Conclusion: The Faces Intervention effectively improved facial affect recognition in participants with chronic post-traumatic brain injury, and changes were maintained for 6 months. Future work should focus on generalizing this skill to functional behaviors.	2.3
As a replacement for mineral materials, geotextiles have been pervasively used in civil engineering so as to provide separation and filtration. This study aims to recycle Kevlar selvages for the preparation of nonwoven geotextiles. The effects of fiber types and manufacturing processing are examined in terms of pore size, water permeability, and shear resistance (bursting strength, and puncture strength). The test results and statistical analyses indicate that a combination of 20 wt% Kevlar fibers, 60 wt% three-dimensional crimped polyester (PET) fibers, and 20 wt% low-melting-point PET (LMPET) fibers creates geotextiles that have a small pore size, good water permeability, and good shear resistance. These geotextiles prevent soil loss, and have greater water permeability and a higher resistance to sharp objects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.1
Water consumption is likely to increase substantially in the future on account of rising population, economic growth, and social development. Rapid urbanization and population growth of Allahabad city, has necessitated thinking about the declination in ground water level as well as supply of sufficient quantity of water for future either for drinking purpose or industrial use. In the present study, rainfall recharge of Allahabad city has been computed on GIS platform (ArcInfo). Groundwater recharge potential zones of Allahabad city have also been found out using GIS. Case study of recharge of ground water through roof top rainwater harvesting at Vikas Bhawan (a multistoryed building), Allahabad is discussed. An implementation of this analysis and decision making software is expected to work for sustainable water management.	4.3
Monitoring message workflow transmission is a very challenging problem, especially in pervasive environments, mainly because of the wide range of unexpected events (e.g. human and material resources unavailability) and context changes (e.g. source and target localizations) that may occur at run-time. In this paper, we propose an information system and services orchestration framework enabling intelligent message routing policy adaptation. Our objective is to build a reliable routing strategy that can autonomously and intelligently adapt its own behavior and decisions according to source and target context changes as well as to controlled message status (e.g. exceeded deadlines for message reception). We present a solution that emphasizes some cutting-edge characteristics that we believe are crucial for enhancing the quality of message communication, such as intelligence, controllability, scalability, adaptivity and personalization. The routing decisions can be adapted at different levels of decision-making such as message itinerary, delay for message treatment, etc., by means of advanced AI methods that we detail for some of the most sensitive self-adaptive services.	4.0
Thyroid cancer is very common, but skull ectopic thyroid cancer has not been reported in 50 years of literatures in foreign countries. There are only four cases of the skull ectopic thyroid cancer reported in more than 30 years of domestic literature including the cases in this report. This paper aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and possible molecular mechanisms of this rare disease. Five keywords of thyroid gland, ectopic thyroid, thyroid cancer, ectopic thyroid cancer and metastatic thyroid cancer were included and 50 years of literatures in the PubMed-MEDLINE and Wanfang database were reviewed. By combining the test data of 2 cases of surgical patient tissue microarray specimens-molecular immunology pathology, the possible molecular mechanisms were analyzed and molecular regulation network diagram was drawn. The skull ectopic thyroid cancer has not been reported in 50 years of literatures in foreign countries and there are only four cases of the skull ectopic thyroid cancer reported in more than 30 years of domestic literature including the cases in this report. The molecular expressions of skull ectopic thyroid cancer, orthotopic thyroid cancer, and metastatic thyroid cancer were not the same: (I) AKT (P=0.012, 0.002) and mTOR (P=0.002, 0.004) were highly expressed in the skull ectopic thyroid cancer; (II) BRAF (P=0.029, 0.014) and ERK (P=0.002, 0.001) were highly expressed in orthotopic thyroid cancer; (III) MMP-9 (P=0.023, 0.016) was highly expressed in metastatic thyroid cancer. According to the molecular information base, the PI3K is predicted to be a key crossing gene of the above three signaling pathways, which showed no significant differences in these three thyroid cancers (P=0.692, 0.388, 0.227), but PI3K has regulation roles in the three signaling pathways of Akt/mTOR, MAPK, and NF-kappa B. PI3K gene is an important starting gene of thyroid cancers. After the canceration starts, due to the fact that the local microenvironments of thyroid cancers in different parts are different, the thyroid cancers are regulated by different signaling pathways. The ectopic thyroid cancer was correlated with Akt/mTOR pathway high expression; orthotopic thyroid was related with MAPK/BRAF/ERK signaling pathway high expression; and the metastatic thyroid cancer was related with NFkB/MMP9 high expression.	6.3
This article proposes a multiobjective optimization model for the design of a macroscopic water system of a Mexican city that solves simultaneously the planning and scheduling of water storage and distribution tasks. The model, which considers rainwater harvesting and reclaimed water reusing as alternative water sources, maximizes the revenues from water sales and minimizes simultaneously the water consumption and land use. A case study based on the city of Morelia in Mexico was solved. It was found that the use of alternative water sources (such as harvested rainwater) along with an appropriate planning and scheduling of storage and distribution tasks have the potential to reduce the pressure over natural reservoirs significantly. Our approach considers simultaneously economic and environmental concerns, thereby contributing to the implementation of more sustainable alternatives in urban water distribution.

Purpose of review Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research. Recent findings The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease. Summary Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.	6.4
Currently, increasing importance has been attached to heavy metal pollution of water environment. In order to help geologist and environmentalist to obtain on-site experimental data, there is an urgent need to develop portable analysis techniques of water quality, which can be used to give an timely and accurate assessment of water quality of the contaminated area with low cost and to monitor water environment conveniently in daily preventing and controlling work of water pollution. Based on adsorption with Purolite S930 chelating resin at pH 4 and thin-film sample preparation technique, a rapid and simple on-site-oriented analysis method of heavy metal ions, namely Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in aqueous solutions, was developed utilizing a handheld energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence in this paper. The correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were greater than 0. 992 for all six metal ions, the lower limits of detection were between 5. 8 and 18. 6 mu g . L-1. Precision tests carried out on multi-element mixed solutions showed that the relative standard deviations (RSD, n=10) were better than 15%. The method has been used on-site to analysis 21 water samples collected from different river or well sites near a mining area northeast China. Out of the five underground water samples, one was found contaminated by Cu and Zn (Class Id), one by Zn and Fe (Class I[), and one by Fe(in between Class II to III). Surface water samples showed better qualities. But two out of the sixteen were found to be contaminated by Mn heavily (Class IV). Laboratory ICPMS was used to analyze the same samples. The results for Cu, Ni and Pb were coincident with the on-site data in general. But for Zn and Mn with higher concentrations, on-site data were lower than that by ICPMS. The reason for that might be the inclusion of the fine suspending particles in the samples by ICPMS. We conclude that the on-site data were effective. With the described method, an overall data acquisition time, including sampling, processing and measuring, can be within 12 hours for a batch of 10 samples. The pre-concentration device and the XRF instrument are both small, light, portable and can operate without external power supply. So, the method is suitable for on-site water sample analysis, especially in remote areas.	4.4
Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles surrounded by a lipid membrane, which tend to be secreted toward extra-cellular environments. Despite being defined as vesicles involved in excretion of molecular wastes by Rose Johnstone in the 1970s, further studies revealed them to be effective in various biological processes such as cancer development, regulation of the immune system, intercellular communication, stem cell biology, and tissue/organ regeneration. Although many studies dealing with the role of exosomes in stem cell differentiation and the use of exosomes isolated from stem cells for the treatment of several diseases have been published, the involved mechanisms remain largely unknown. Further understanding of these mechanisms, which include the involved cellular pathways, may improve the use of exosomes in diagnostic and treatment methods, especially for those involving stem cells. Here, we describe some recent data describing the action mechanism of stem cell-derived exosomes focusing on the implicated cellular pathways, hoping to provide novel information that will be useful for cell biology scientists working in this field.	6.1
The Water Cooled Ceramic Breeder blanket (WCCB) is being researched for Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR). The thermal-hydraulic analysis is essential because the blanket should remove the high heat flux from the plasma and the volumetric heat generated by neutrons. In this paper, the detailed three dimensional (3D) thermal hydraulic analysis on the whole module of WCCB blanket has been performed by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, which is capable of solving conjugate heat transfer between solid structure and fluid. The main results, including temperature field, distribution of mass flow rate and coolant pressure drop, have been calculated simultaneously. These provides beneficial guidance data for the further structural optimization and for the design arrangement of primary and secondary circuit. Under the total heat source of 1.23 MW, the coolant mass flow rate of 5.457 kg/s is required to make coolant water corresponding to the Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) condition (15.5 MPa, 285 degrees C-325 degrees C), generating the total coolant pressure drop (Delta P) of 0.467 MPa. The results show that the present structural design can make all the materials effectively cooled to the allowable temperature range, except for a few small modifications on the both sides of FW. The main components, including the first wall (FW), cooling plates (CPs), side wall (SWs)&stiffening plates (SPs) and the manifold(1-4), dominate 4.7%/41.7%/13%/40.6% of the total pressure drop, respectively. Additionally, the mass flow rate of each channel has been obtained, showing the peak relative deviation of 3.4% and 2% from the average for the paratactic channels and components separately. Generally, the results indicate that the present design of WCCB blanket can meet the requirements of thermal hydraulics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.1
Ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), uric acid(UA) and tryptophan(Trp) are considered as crucial small biomolecules for physiological processes in human metabolism. Abnormal levels of these species will lead to the occurrence of some diseases and disorders. In this paper, polyethyleneimine (PEI) covalent functionalized graphene(PEI-G) was used to modify glassy carbon electrode and applied for the simultaneous and sensitive determination of the four molecules. The PEI-G nanocomposite was characterized by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy(FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), X-ray powder diffraction(XRD) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The electrochemical behaviors of AA, DA, UA and Trp on PEI-G modified electrode were studied in detail. And the optimal experimental conditions for the simultaneous determination of AA, DA, UA and Trp were explored. The results showed that the oxidation peaks of the four species could be well separated and the peak to peak separations were 298 mV (AA-DA), 130 mV (DA-UA) and 350 mV(UA-Trp), respectively. The linear response ranges for the simultaneous detection of AA, DA, UA and Trp were 50-5800 mu mol/L, 30-2570 mu mol/L, 0.05-400 mu mol/L and 6-1000 mu mol/L, with the detection limits of 16.67 mu mol/L, 10 mu mol/L, 0.017 mu mol/L and 2 mu mol/L, respectively. The proposed method provides a promising strategy for the simultaneous detection of these species in practical application.	6.2
Quantitative genetics theory predicts adaptive evolution to be constrained along evolutionary lines of least resistance. In theory, hybridization and subsequent interspecific gene flow may, however, rapidly change the evolutionary constraints of a population and eventually change its evolutionary potential, but empirical evidence is still scarce. Using closely related species pairs of Lake Victoria cichlids sampled from four different islands with different levels of interspecific gene flow, we tested for potential effects of introgressive hybridization on phenotypic evolution in wild populations. We found that these effects differed among our study species. Constraints measured as the eccentricity of phenotypic variance-covariance matrices declined significantly with increasing gene flow in the less abundant species for matrices that have a diverged line of least resistance. In contrast, we find no such decline for the more abundant species. Overall our results suggest that hybridization can change the underlying phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, potentially increasing the adaptive potential of such populations.	6.4
The effects of globalization, is the globalization of responsibilities. Due to globalization, global or international criminal responsibility of the perpetrators of the crime will follow. States as one of the international actors are also not exempt from this, and the issue of criminal responsibility for them, because the rulers of communication and sensitivity to its governance principles, coupled with a lot of complexity. According to the principle of necessity, anticipate criminal responsibility of states to prevent and avoid a lot of international crimes by nature and only with the support and assistance of States in the international dimension, to establish international order and security, in line with the process of globalization is inevitable. However, with the removal of Article 19 of the draft international responsibility of the State, approved by the International Law Commission, represents the most important source of international criminal responsibility of the government, doubt the government, there is no criminal liability, it should be stressed that the elimination of the need for It does not prejudice the existence of numerous international documents and procedures, are an expression of this. The fact is that many of the behaviors that violate the rules of universal acceptance of the international community, can be done only by governments and civil responsibility only for governments to violate the rules of universal and important, in accordance with the principles of justice and international law, such as the need to maintain international peace and order of the international community, that it makes some states of the vacuum to be exploited. In order to resolve ambiguities about the criminal responsibility of the state, should the use of existing capacity of the international community, including the UN and the Security Council, to build the infrastructure and the necessary arrangements for the progressive development of these institutions, such as that for the International Criminal Court done.	2.0
The occurrence of repetitive behaviours that are often harmful has been attributed to traits traditionally described as impulsive or compulsive e.g. substance dependence, excessive gambling, and hoarding. These behaviours are common and often co-occur in both the general population and psychiatric populations. The lack of measures to concurrently index a range of such behaviours led to the development of the Impulsive-Compulsive Behaviours (ICB) Checklist This study aims to validate the ICB Checklist in a general community sample. Factor analyses revealed a two-factor structure, demonstrating good model fit in two independent samples. These were labelled Impulsive-Compulsions and Compulsive-Impulsions, comprising of classically compulsive and impulsive behaviours respectively. Reliability and construct validity were further confirmed using correlations with existing Measures of impulsivity and compulsivity. Results suggest that the ICB Checklist is a valid and practical assessment that can be used to monitor behavioural clusters characterised by deficits in inhibition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry techniques were employed to study borohydride oxidation on a polycrystalline Pt electrode in an aqueous alkaline media containing 0.05 M NaBH4 and 1 M NaOH. Determined current density changes were interpreted in combination with EIS measurements. The regions of decreasing anodic current leading to negative polarization resistance, R-p, were supposed to be appreciably related to increasing availability of oxygen-containing species (OHad and Pt oxides) on the Pt surface in the presence of the accumulated borohydride species. Possible borohydride oxidation processes and electrical circuits were discussed regarding the potential applied.	1.2
Mastitis is defined as the inflammation of the mammary gland. There is generally no effective treatment for mastitis in animals. Puerarin, extracted from Radix puerariae, has been proven to possess many biological activities. The present study aims to reveal the potential mechanism that is responsible for the antiinflammatory action of puerarin in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced mastitis in mice. Histopathological changes showed that puerarin ameliorated the inflammatory injury induced by S. aureus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and ELISA analysis indicated that puerarin not only suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 but also promoted the secretion of IL-10. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is important in the immune defense against S. aureus infection. Research in molecular biology has shown that the expression of TLR2 was inhibited with administration of puerarin. Further studies were performed on NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways using western blot. The results demonstrated that puerarin suppressed phosphorylated IkB, p65, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1and 2 (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a dose-dependent manner. All of the results suggested that puerarin may be a potential therapy for treating mastitis. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	6.0
Background: Spondyloarthritis (SpA) traditionally encompasses ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) inflammation is an important and usually the first finding of SpA. Objectives: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the value of different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences in evaluation of bone marrow and subchondral bone changes in active sacroiliitis and inter-and intra-observer reliability of these sequences. Patients and Methods: Ninety patients (65 males, 25 females; meanage 33.44 +/- 11 years; range 15 to 62) withMRIfindings suggestive of active sacroiliitis were selected from picture archive and communication system (PACS) by the consensus of two radiologists. The SIJs were retrospectively analyzed by two radiologists separately blinded to each other's evaluations. Each sequence was evaluated at different times (one week apart from each other) in the same monitor of PACS system by each observer. Periarticular bone edema and contrast enhancement were recorded separately by each observer. Results: Highest agreement between measurements of observer 1 and 2 was found on contrast enhanced fat suppressed T1 weighted imaging (CE FS T1 WI) (97.78%) among all sequences and on FS T2 WI of axial planes within sequences taken before contrast injections (97.78%). Conclusion: FS T2Wand CE FS T1Wsequences of axial planes were the most useful sequences in determination of active sacroiliitis. Therefore, in patients with renal failure or allergy to contrast media, FS T2 WI can be obtained to detect active sacroiliitis.	5.3
A novel digital envelope modulator for envelope tracking radio frequency power amplifier is presented in this paper. The proposed modulator consists of a parallel combination of linear class AB and switching class D power amplifiers that are controlled digitally. In the previous analog architectures, the requirements needed for the AB operational amplifier such as high-current driving capability, high bandwidth and large output swing is usually obtainable at high overall static power dissipation. The digitally controlled power opamp presented here not only provides the aforementioned requirements but also reduces power dissipation compared with previous work. Furthermore, the digital control of the modulator makes it adaptive to the input signal variations in comparison with conventional analog parallel hybrid envelope modulators. The digital processor of the modulator is evaluated with a 45-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The overall power consumption of the digital processor is around 142mW at 1.5-GHz clock frequency. As an application, the designed digital class AB is incorporated in a complete envelope modulator architecture. The overall efficiency of the modulator, including the digital processor power consumption, is around 82% at an average 32dBm output power for a 5-MHz input signal.

Purpose of review The task of cataloging human genetic variation and its relation to disease is rapidly approaching completion. The new challenge is to discover the function of disease-associated genes and to understand the pathways that lead to human disease. We propose that achieving this new level of understanding will increasingly rely on the use of model organisms. We discuss the advantages of the mouse as a model organism to our understanding of human disease. Recent findings The collection of available mouse strains represents as much genetic and phenotypic variation as is found in the human population. However, unlike humans, mice can be subjected to experimental breeding protocols and the availability of tissues allows for a far greater and deeper level of phenotyping. New methods for gene editing make it relatively easy to create mouse models of known human mutations. The distinction between genetic and epigenetic inheritance can be studied in great detail. Various experimental protocols enable the exploration of the role of the microbiome in physiology and disease. Summary We propose that there will be an interdependence between human and model organism research. Technological advances and new genetic screening platforms in the mouse have greatly improved the path to gene discovery and mechanistic studies of gene function.	6.4
Craniofacial bone defects are challenging problems for maxillofacial surgeons over the years. With the development of cell and molecular biology, gene therapy is a breaking new technology with the aim of regenerating tissues by acting as a delivery system for therapeutic genes in the craniofacial region rather than treating genetic disorders. A systematic review was conducted summarizing the articles reporting gene therapy in maxillofacial surgery to answer the question: Was gene therapy successfully applied to regenerate bone in the maxillofacial region? Electronic searching of online databases was performed in addition to hand searching of the references of included articles. Nolanguage or time restrictions were enforced. Meta-analysis was done to assess significant bone formation after delivery of gene material in the surgically induced maxillofacial defects. The search identified 2081 articles, of which 57 were included with 1726 animals. Bone morphogenetic proteins were commonly used proteins for gene therapy. Viral vectors were the universally used vectors. Sprague-Dawley rats were the frequently used animal model in experimental studies. The quality of the articles ranged from excellent to average. Meta-analysis results performed on 21 articles showed that defects favored bone formation by gene therapy. Funnel plot showed symmetry with the absence of publication bias. Gene therapy is on the top list of innovative strategies that developed in the last 10 years with the hope of developing a simple chair-side protocol in the near future, combining improvement of gene delivery as well as knowledge of the molecular basis of oral and maxillofacial structures.	6.0
This paper presents a machine-learning classifier where computations are performed in a standard 6T SRAM array, which stores the machine-learning model. Peripheral circuits implement mixed-signal weak classifiers via columns of the SRAM, and a training algorithm enables a strong classifier through boosting and also overcomes circuit nonidealities, by combining multiple columns. A prototype 128 x 128 SRAM array, implemented in a 130-nm CMOS process, demonstrates ten-way classification of MNIST images (using image-pixel features downsampled from 28 x 28 = 784 to 9 x 9 = 81, which yields a baseline accuracy of 90%). In SRAM mode (bit-cell read/write), the prototype operates up to 300 MHz, and in classify mode, it operates at 50 MHz, generating a classification every cycle. With accuracy equivalent to a discrete SRAM/digital-MAC system, the system achieves ten-way classification at an energy of 630 pJ per decision, 113x lower than a discrete system with standard training algorithm and 13x lower than a discrete system with the proposed training algorithm.	0.1
We have derived a rapidly computed analytical solution for drawdown caused by a partially or fully penetrating directional wellbore (vertical, horizontal, or slant) via Green's function method. The mathematical model assumes an anisotropic, homogeneous, confined, box-shaped aquifer. Any dimension of the box can have one of six possible boundary conditions: 1) both sides no-flux; 2) one side no-flux one side constant-head; 3) both sides constant-head; 4) one side no-flux; 5) one side constant-head; 6) free boundary conditions. The solution has been optimized for rapid computation via Poisson Resummation, derivation of convergence rates, and numerical optimization of integration techniques. Upon application of the Poisson Resummation method, we were able to derive two sets of solutions with inverse convergence rates, namely an early-time rapidly convergent series (solution-A) and a late-time rapidly convergent series (solution-B). From this work we were able to link Green's function method (solution-B) back to image well theory (solution-A). We then derived an equation defining when the convergence rate between solution-A and solution-B is the same, which we termed the switch time. Utilizing the more rapidly convergent solution at the appropriate time, we obtained rapid convergence at all times. We have also shown that one may simplify each of the three infinite series for the three-dimensional solution to 11 terms and still maintain a maximum relative error of less than 10(-14).

Market-led strategies for growth and development have resulted in negative externalities at the various stages of production and consumption cycle, leading to the destruction of the environment, with negative consequences for sustainable development. Prior to the emergence of sustainable development, economic development, which was geared more towards economic growth paid less attention to externalities. Since 1983, vibrant and competitive private sector; and entrepreneurship approaches have been tapped in Ghana for the creation of jobs and employment. These, coupled with other factors, transitioned the country to middle-income status in 2011. The undue focus on a competitive private sector without prudent practices of sustainability has led to over exploitation and use of natural resources and this has caused deforestation, land degradation, air and water pollution, soil erosion, overgrazing and destruction of bio-diversity. These effects are estimated to cost about 10% of the country's GDP annually. Green entrepreneurship is very vital for addressing these challenges and the eradication of poverty. Using a desk study approach, this paper assesses how Ghana can harness the innovative potentials of green entrepreneurship to foster the attainment of sustainable development.	4.4
Operant extinction is learning to supress a previously rewarded behavior. It is known to be strongly associated with the specific context in which it was acquired, which limits the therapeutic use of operant extinction in behavioral treatments, e. g., of addiction. We examined whether sleep influences contextual memory of operant extinction over time, using two different recall tests (Recent and Remote). Rats were trained in an operant conditioning task (lever press) in context A, then underwent extinction training in context B, followed by a 3-h retention period that contained either spontaneous morning sleep, morning sleep deprivation, or spontaneous evening wakefulness. A recall test was performed either immediately after the 3-h experimental retention period (Recent recall) or after 48 h (Remote), in the extinction context B and in a novel context C. The two main findings were: (i) at the Recent recall test, sleep in comparison with sleep deprivation and spontaneous wakefulness enhanced extinction memory but, only in the extinction context B; (ii) at the Remote recall, extinction performance after sleep was enhanced in both contexts B and C to an extent comparable to levels at Recent recall in context B. Interestingly, extinction performance at Remote recall was also improved in the sleep deprivation groups in both contexts, with no difference to performance in the sleep group. Our results suggest that 3 h of post-learning sleep transiently facilitate the context specificity of operant extinction at a Recent recall. However, the improvement and contextual generalization of operant extinction memory observed in the long-term, i. e., after 48 h, does not require immediate post-learning sleep.	5.0
The treatment of AD is a topic that has puzzled researchers for many years. Current mainstream theories still consider A beta to be the most important target for the cure of AD. In this study, we attempted to explore multiple targets for AD treatments with the aim of identifying a qualified compound that could both inhibit the aggregation of A beta and block the RAGE/A beta axis. We believed that a compound that targets both A beta and RAGE may be a feasible strategy for AD treatment. A novel and small natural compound, Matrine (Mat), was identified by high-throughput screening of the main components of traditional Chinese herbs used to treat dementia. Various experimental techniques were used to evaluate the effect of Mat on these two targets both in vitro and in AD mouse model. Mat could inhibit A beta 42-induced cytotoxicity and suppress the A beta/RAGE signaling pathway in vitro. Additionally, the results of in vivo evaluations of the effects of Mat on the two targets were consistent with the results of our in vitro studies. Furthermore, Mat reduced proinflammatory cytokines and A beta deposition and attenuated the memory deficits of AD transgenic mice. We believe that this novel, multi-target strategy to inhibit both A beta and RAGE, is worthy of further exploration. Therefore, our future studies will focus on identifying even more effective multi-target compounds for the treatment of AD based on the molecular structure of Mat.	5.2
While the hominin fossil record cannot inform us on either the presence or extent of social and cognitive abilities that may have paved the way for the emergence of language, studying non-vocal communication among our closest living relatives, the African apes, may provide valuable information about how language originated. Although much has been learned from gestural signaling in non-human primates, we have not yet established how and why gestural repertoires vary across species, what factors influence this variation, and how knowledge of these differences can contribute to an understanding of gestural signaling's contribution to language evolution. In this paper, we review arguments surrounding the theory that language evolved from gestural signaling and suggest some important factors to consider when conducting comparative studies of gestural communication among African apes. Specifically, we propose that social dynamics and positional behavior are critical components that shape the frequency and nature of gestural signaling across species and we argue that an understanding of these factors could shed light on how gestural communication may have been the basis of human language. We outline predictions for the influence of these factors on the frequencies and types of gestures used across the African apes and highlight the importance of including these factors in future gestural communication research with primates.

Pediatricians working in an emergency environment are confronted with children admitted to emergency departments for intoxication on a daily basis. We carried out a retrospective cohort study of children admitted to a pediatric emergency department due to unintentional cannabis exposure over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2014. Twenty-nine children under the age of 3 were admitted with a positive cannabis urine test. Eighty-seven percent of intoxications occurred at the family home. Resin was the main form of ingested cannabis (69%). The mean age was 16.5 +/- 5.2 months, and mean weight was 11.1 +/- 2.1 Kg. Sixty percent of admissions occurred between 2012 and 2014. More severe presentations, based on Poisoning Severity Score, occurred over the past 2 years. Four children experienced seizures before admission. Ten children (34%) had a decreased level of consciousness (GCS < 12) and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit for 12-24 h. All of them had ingested hashish (resin). The majority (70%) of children suffering from neurological impairment were admitted in the last year, of whom three required assisted ventilation. There were no cases with major outcomes and no deaths. Parents were not assessed regarding their cannabis consumption. Conclusion: This study supports the impression that accidental child poisonings with cannabis have been more serious than previously thought for 2 years. This observation may be explained by (1) the increased THC concentration in cannabis and (2) the widespread use in young adults, even after they become parents. Introducing an addiction team inside the PED could help to improve the care links with these parents.	5.0
Dendritic cell function is modulated by stromal cells, including fibroblasts. Although poorly understood, the signals delivered through this crosstalk substantially alter dendritic cell biology. This is well illustrated with release of TNF-alpha/IL-1 beta from activated dendritic cells, promoting PGE(2) secretion from stromal fibroblasts. This instructs dendritic cells to up-regulate IL-23, a key Th17-polarizing cytokine. We previously showed that ionizing radiation inhibited IL-23 production by human dendritic cells in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that dendritic cell-fibroblast crosstalk overcomes the suppressive effect of ionizing radiation to support appropriately polarized Th17 responses. Radiation (1-6 Gy) markedly suppressed IL-23 secretion by activated dendritic cells (P < 0.0001) without adversely impacting their viability and consequently, inhibited the generation of Th17 responses. Cytokine suppression by ionizing radiation was selective, as there was no effect on IL-1 beta, -6, -10, and -27 or TNF-alpha and only a modest (11%) decrease in IL-12p70 secretion. Coculture with fibroblasts augmented IL-23 secretion by irradiated dendritic cells and increased Th17 responses. Importantly, in contrast to dendritic cells, irradiated fibroblasts maintained their capacity to respond to TNF-a/IL-1b and produce PGE2, thus providing the key intermediary signals for successful dendritic cell-fibroblasts crosstalk. In summary, stromal fibroblasts support Th17-polarizing cytokine production by dendritic cells that would otherwise be suppressed in an irradiated microenvironment. This has potential ramifications for understanding the immune response to local radiotherapy. These findings underscore the need to account for the impact of microenvironmental factors, including stromal cells, in understanding the control of immunity.	6.1
The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is viewed as a glia-enriched conduit of forward-migrating neuroblasts in which chemorepulsive signals control the pace of forward migration. Here we demonstrate the existence of a scaffold of neurons that receive synaptic inputs within the rat, mouse, and human fetal RMS equivalents. These neurons express secretagogin, a Ca2+-sensor protein, to execute an annexin V-dependent externalization of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) for reconfiguring the extracellular matrix locally. Mouse genetics combined with pharmacological probing in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that MMP-2 externalization occurs on demand and that its loss slows neuroblast migration. Loss of function is particularly remarkable upon injury to the olfactory bulb. Cumulatively, we identify a signaling cascade that provokes structural remodeling of the RMS through recruitment of MMP-2 by a previously unrecognized neuronal constituent. Given the life-long presence of secretagogin-containing neurons in human, this mechanism might be exploited for therapeutic benefit in rescue strategies.	6.4
The current controller with fast transient response and satisfactory steady state characteristics is required in PMSM Servo System. In this paper, the application of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for current loop is proposed and the design proceeding of a first-order ADRC controller in the current loop is elaborated. Then, by taking use of the ADRC controller and the analysis of the digital control delay effect, an improved method focusing on delay effects is presented. By taking these measures, the current regulation can achieve high performance. Simulation and experimental results verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed method.	1.4
Apples are a widely consumed fruit and have a high polyphenol content. The aim of this study was to analyse the combined effects of osmotic dehydration (OD) and ohmic heating (OH) with a pulsed vacuum (PV) on polyphenol retention during the stored refrigeration of apple cubes. Treatments were performed using a 65 degrees Brix sucrose solution at 30, 40 or 50 degrees C for 120 min, and then, samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. OH provides an electric field of 13 V cm(-1), and a pulsed vacuum was applied for 5 min at the beginning of the process. The results indicated that a lower temperature process (30-40 degrees C) resulted in the retention of more polyphenol compounds after treatment than a higher temperature process (50 degrees C). Nevertheless, during refrigerated storage, we observed that 50 degrees C preserved these compounds better due to polyphenol oxidase inactivation. PVOD/OH treatment at 50 degrees C was determined to be the best retention of polyphenols from the fresh apple for dehydrating apples.	1.0
Background: IL-17A is a key driver of human autoimmune diseases, particularly psoriasis. Objective: We sought to determine the role of IL-17A in psoriasis pathogenesis and to identify a robust and measurable biomarker of IL-17A-driven pathology. Methods: We studied 8 healthy subjects and 8 patients with psoriasis before and after administration of secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A mAb, and used a combination of classical techniques and a novel skin microperfusion assay to evaluate the expression of 170 proteins in blood, nonlesional skin, and lesional skin. For validation, we also tested stored sera from 601 patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases. Results: IL-17A was specifically expressed in lesional compared with nonlesional psoriatic skin (9.8 vs 0.8 pg/mL, P <.001). Proteomic and gene transcription analyses revealed dysregulated antimicrobial peptides, proinflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil chemoattractants, levels of which returned to normal after treatment with secukinumab. beta-Defensin 2 (BD-2) was identified as a biomarker of IL-17A-driven pathology by comparing protein expression in patients with psoriasis versus that in healthy subjects (5746 vs 82 pg/mL in serum, P <.0001; 2747 vs <218 pg/mL in dermis, P <.001), responsiveness to secukinumab therapy, and synergistic induction by IL-17A and TNF-alpha in epidermal keratinocytes. In a validation set of sera from 601 patients with autoimmune diseases thought to be IL-17A driven, we found that BD-2 levels are most highly increased in patients with psoriatic skin lesions, and in patients with psoriasis, BD-2 levels correlated well with IL-17A levels (r = 0.70, n = 199, P <.001) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores (r = 0.53, n 5 281, P <.001). Conclusion: IL-17A is a primary driver of skin pathology in patients with psoriasis, and serum BD-2 is an easily measurable biomarker of IL-17A-driven skin pathology.	5.3
A correct diagnosis of electrical circuits is very essential in industrial plants. An article deals with a recognition method of early fault detection of induction motor. The described approach is based on patterns recognition. Acoustic signals of specific induction motor are analyzed patterns. Acoustic signals include information about motor state. The analysis of the patterns was conducted for three states of induction motor using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), shortened method of frequencies selection (SMoFS-10) and Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM). The results of calculations suggest that the method is efficient and can be also used for diagnostic purposes.	1.2
BackgroundExcessive ethanol (EtOH) consumption remains an important health concern and effective treatments are lacking. The central oxytocin system has emerged as a potentially important therapeutic target for alcohol and drug addiction. These studies tested the hypothesis that oxytocin reduces EtOH consumption. MethodsMale C57BL/6J mice were given access to EtOH (20% v/v) using a model of binge-like drinking (drinking in the dark) that also included the use of lickometer circuits to evaluate the temporal pattern of intake as well as 2-bottle choice drinking in the home cage. In addition, EtOH (12% v/v) and sucrose (5% w/v) self-administration on fixed- and progressive-ratio schedules were also evaluated. A wide range of systemically administered oxytocin doses were tested (0 to 10mg/kg) in these models. ResultsOxytocin (0, 0.3, 1, 3, or 10mg/kg) dose dependently reduced EtOH consumption (maximal 45% reduction) in the binge drinking model, with lower effective doses having minimal effects on general locomotor activity. Oxytocin's effect was blocked by pretreatment with an oxytocin receptor antagonist, and the pattern of contacts (licks) at the EtOH bottle suggested a reduction in motivation to drink EtOH. Oxytocin decreased 2-bottle choice drinking without altering general fluid intake. Oxytocin also reduced operant responding for EtOH and sucrose in a dose-related manner. However, oxytocin decreased responding and motivation (breakpoint values) for EtOH at doses that did not alter responding for sucrose. ConclusionsThese results indicate that oxytocin reduces EtOH consumption in different models of self-administration. The effects are not likely due to a general sedative effect of the neuropeptide. Further, oxytocin reduces motivation for EtOH at doses that do not alter responding for a natural reward (sucrose). While some evidence supports a role for oxytocin receptors in mediating these effects, additional studies are needed to further elucidate underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, these results support the therapeutic potential of oxytocin as a treatment for alcohol use disorder.	5.0
With the application of digital control, the problem of one-step-delay appears. It limits the achievable control bandwidth. Compared with one-step-delay, minimized delay can achieve superior performance. However, it leads to the low-frequency aliasing phenomenon because sampling is not happened in the middle of either the turn-on or the turn-off times of IGBT. To weaken the influence of aliasing and reduce the total harmonics distortion (THD) of output current, the strategy of reducing the inductor current feedback coefficient by adjusting non-dominant poles is proposed. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme.	1.4
Contextual-based image classification attempts at considering spatial/temporal information during the learning process in order to make the classification process smarter. Sequential learning techniques are one of the most used ones to perform contextual classification, being based on a two-step classification process, in which the traditional noncontextual learning process is followed by one more step of classification based on an extended feature vector. In this paper, we propose two ensemble-based approaches to make sequential learning techniques less prone to errors, since their effectiveness is strongly dependent on the feature extension process, which ends up adding the wrong predicted label of the neighborhood samples as new features. The proposed approaches are validated in the context of land-cover classification, being their results considerably better than some state-of-the-art techniques in the literature.	4.2
Psychological research has provided essential insights into how stigma operates to disadvantage those who are targeted by it. At the same time, stigma research has been criticized for being too focused on the perceptions of stigmatized individuals and on microlevel interactions, rather than attending to structural forms of stigma. This article describes the relatively new field of research on structural stigma, which is defined as societal-level conditions, cultural norms, and institutional policies that constrain the opportunities, resources, and well-being of the stigmatized. I review emerging evidence that structural stigma related to mental illness and sexual orientation (a) exerts direct and synergistic effects on stigma processes that have long been the focus of psychological inquiry (e.g., concealment, rejection sensitivity), (b) serves as a contextual moderator of the efficacy of psychological interventions, and (c) contributes to numerous adverse health outcomes for members of stigmatized groups-ranging from dysregulated physiological stress responses to premature mortality-indicating that structural stigma represents an underrecognized mechanism producing health inequalities. Each of these pieces of evidence suggests that structural stigma is relevant to psychology and therefore deserves the attention of psychological scientists interested in understanding and ultimately reducing the negative effects of stigma.	2.0
This review paper discusses the perspective of complex biological systems as applied to inheritance and ontogeny, focusing on the continuity of genetic, epigenetic (transgenerational) and microbiotic inheritance. The informational processuality within this continuity can be used as to exemplify the insufficiency of hierarchical concepts in grasping the complex and integrated nature of biological processes. The argument follows Bruni and Giorgi (Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology 119, 481-92, 2015) in emphasizing that while structures and substrates are organized hierarchically, communicational processes are organized heterarchically. The essay also argues the insufficiency of a single, basic, i.e. genetic level of description, which is the prevalent idea of twentieth century biology, to explain all phenotypic variation. I argue that inheritance and development cannot be fully explained by some sub- or super-ordination and that such descriptions are merely heuristic tools that do not reflect the nature of such processes.	6.0
We previously developed the Bio-Pick, Place, and Perfuse (Bio-P3) instrument to fabricate large perfusable tissue constructs by stacking and aligning scaffold-free living microtissues with integrated lumens. The Bio-P3 required an actuating mechanism to manipulate living microtissues of various sizes and shapes that are fragile, and must remain in an aqueous environment. The optical transparency of the Bio-P3 gripping device was essential to provide unobstructed visuals for accurate alignment of microtissues. We previously engineered a pilot fluid force-driven bio-gripper that can pick-and-place microtissue in planar position without causing cellular damage by pulling culture medium through track-etched membrane-integrated cell culture inserts. In this study, we invented a new flexible bio-gripper design that maximized the bio-gripper utilities. We utilized experimental approaches, multivariate analyzes, and theoretical modeling to elucidate how membrane characteristics (pore size, pore density, membrane thickness, membrane area, and surface chemistry) altered bio-gripper robustness and the flow rate (Q(c)) required for successful gripping. We devised two standardized tests and synthetic parts that mimicked microtissues, to systematically quantify bio-gripper performance. All thirteen syringe pump-driven bio-grippers except one successfully gripped and released synthetic parts with values of Q(c) that coincided with our mathematical simulation of the fluid mechanics of gripping. The bio-gripper could grip synthetic parts of various sizes, shapes and masses, demonstrating the robustness of the actuating mechanism. Multivariate analysis of experimental data indicated that both membrane porosity and thickness modulated Q(c), and in addition, revealed that membrane pore density determined membrane optical transparency. Fabricating large tissue constructs requires repeated stacking of microtissues. We showed that one bio-gripper could pick-and-place living microtissues thirty times with Q(c) corresponding to our simulation. Our bio-gripper was capable of stacking and aligning twenty microtissues. In summary, we successfully engineered a robust controllable fluid-driven bio-gripper to efficiently manipulate living microtissues and micro-objects in an aqueous environment.	3.4
Previous studies on waste incineration as part of the energy system show that waste management and energy supply are highly dependent on each other, and that the preconditions for the energy system setup affects the avoided emissions and thereby even sometimes the total outcome of an environmental assessment. However, it has not been previously shown explicitly which key parameters are most crucial, how much each parameter affects results and conclusions and how different aspects depend on each other. The interconnection between waste incineration and the energy system is elaborated by testing parameters potentially crucial to the result: design of the incineration plant, avoided energy generation, degree of efficiency, electricity efficiency in combined heat and power plants (CHP), avoided fuel, emission level of the avoided electricity generation and avoided waste management. CO2 emissions have been calculated for incineration of 1 kWh mixed combustible waste. The results indicate that one of the most important factors is the electricity efficiency in CHP plants in combination with the emission level of the avoided electricity generation. A novel aspect of this study is the plant by plant comparison showing how different electricity efficiencies associated with different types of fuels and plants influence results. Since waste incineration typically have lower power to fuel ratios, this has implications for further analyses of waste incineration compared to other waste management practises and heat and power production technologies. New incineration capacity should substitute mixed landfill disposal and recovered energy should replace energy from inefficient high polluting plants. Electricity generation must not be lost, as it has to be compensated for by electricity production affecting the overall results.	1.0
Copper is the metal of choice for electrical circuits in electronics. It is lower in cost than silver and offers excellent electrical properties like low electrical resistivity and electromigration resistance. Physical vapor deposition and wet-chemical etching or electroforming are the standard processes used to deposit and pattern copper on silicon and in printed-circuit-board technology. Recently, copper inks and pastes have become available for the printing of copper films, with the potential outcome of lowering the production cost beyond that of the established processes. Furthermore, the printing processes are compatible with role-to-role fabrication, and are hence attractive for flexible electronics. In this study, a bi-modal copper paste containing nano-and micro-particles is transferred in a relief printing process by using silicon stamps. It was possible to demonstrate electrical conductive tracks with a linewidth down to 8 mu m. The spacing between neighboring tracks is related to their width and can be as low as 10 mu m. It was possible to achieve a sheet resistance of less than 8m ohm sq(-1) after formic-acid-assisted sintering at 180 degrees C. The low sintering temperature enables the direct placement of electronic components without additional soldering and thus saves time and production costs.	1.2
In this case, a young male patient diagnosed as hypophosphatemic osteomalacia and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) will be assessed by literature. A 32-year-old male patient who had been previously diagnosed as ankylosing spondylitis and hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was admitted to our clinic. In the beginning of the disease, he complained of pain on the first metatarsal bone and low back. Sacroiliac magnetic resonance (MR) images were interpreted as sacroiliitis. He was diagnosed as AS, and referred to many hospitals and received several therapies. He did not benefit from the treatment and his complaints worsened. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B-27 test was negative and alkaline phosphatase level was high. Old femur fractures were reported in the whole body bone scintigraphy. In addition, the patient was diagnosed with osteomalacia. While the patient was receiving vitamin D, oral phosphate, anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy was added. Patient's diagnosis was reevaluated. His final diagnosis was hypophosphatemic osteomalacia instead of ankylosing spondylitis.	5.3
Self-interested moves, such as manipulation and deception in interpersonal relationships with parties inside and outside the workplace, constitute a serious concern for management. Machiavellianism is often directly blamed for such ethical failures, but more generic individual differences, such as those linked to the use of chameleon-like approaches to match an immediate cultural or social environment (i.e., external locus of control, relativistic beliefs), may have indirect influences. Because these chameleon-inducing personalities may foster self-interested decisions, by prompting the abandonment of strict moral codes, this study investigates Machiavellianism as a potential mechanism by which these personalities relate negatively to ethical work intentions. The results, obtained with a sample of 436 banking employees from Spain, reveal that external locus of control and relativistic beliefs relate positively to Machiavellianism, and that Machiavellianism mediates the negative influence of chameleon-inducing personalities on ethical work intentions. The study thus provides novel information for managers interested in reducing employees' Machiavellian tendencies and offers appropriate strategies for deterring their unethical work behaviors.

Communication has a major impact on how customers perceive sellers and their organizations. Especially, the non-verbal communication such as body language, appearance, facial expressions, gestures, proximity, posture, eye contact that can influence positively or negatively the first impression of customers and their experiences in stores. Salespeople in many countries, especially the developing ones, are just telling about their companies' products because they are unaware of the real role of sellers and the importance of non-verbal communication. In Saudi Arabia, the seller profession has been exclusively for foreign labor until 2006. It is very recently that Saudi workforce enters to the retailing sector as sellers. The non-verbal communication of those sellers has never been evaluated from consumer's point of view. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the non-verbal communication barriers that customers are facing when dealing with Saudi sellers. After discussing the nonverbal communication skills that sellers must have in the light of the previous academic research and the depth interviews with seven focus groups of Saudi customers, this study found that the Saudi customers were not totally satisfied with the current non-verbal communication skills of Saudi sellers. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to develop the non-verbal communication skills of Saudi sellers by intensive trainings, to distinguish more the appearance of their sellers, especially the female ones, to focus on the time of intervention as well as the proximity to customers.

For a long time, Russian historiography has been avoiding the controversial and intricate episodes of the Civil War in Russia due to the specifics of a conformist nature. Such episodes include, among others, the problem of effort unification between the regular 5th Army of RKKA [Workers' and Peasants' Red Army] and the insurgent (partisan) forces of Western Siberia during the elimination of the anti-Bolshevik regime of Admiral A.V. Kolchak (November 1919 - January 1920). The development vector of this process was largely determined by a personal factor, namely the will of Commander of the 5th Army, the Red Lett Genrich Eiche. The objective of this article is to consider the specifics of G. Eiche's personal interaction with the insurgent troops and the evolution of his views regarding the problem of using partisan forces in the context of military actions conducted by the 5th Army he had been leading within Western Siberia. The framework of the resource base for the research were materials from a number of Russian archives (Russian State Military Archive, State Archive of Novosibirsk Oblast, State Historical Museum) that were introduced to the academic circulation for the first time ever and archive documents that had been published earlier in regional subject digests. In this sense, a special attention should be justly paid to the operative documentation of the 5th Army's directorship and the memoirs by G. Eiche and his major antagonist, one of the leaders of Altai partisans, Ya.P. Zhigalin. Based on the complex of these and other materials, the author succeeded in reconstructing the actions G. Eiche undertook on the verge of 1919/1920 to implement the insurgent forces of Western Siberia: on the one hand, as a source of march reinforcements for the 5th Army that was suffering from both combat losses and a typhoid outbreak and, on the other hand, as a strike advance force of RKKA in Siberia and a full participant of military actions. However, due to a number of reasons discussed in the article, these attempts on the part of the commander of the 5th Army generally failed. Particular attention is focused on the unsuccessful experience of G. Eiche to direct vicariously the military actions of the insurgent groups in Altai and Yenisei Provinces of Russia that failed to execute any of the operative orders of the army commander. Finally, it was this particular experience that underlined the general mental disappointment of G. Eiche in the potential, fighting and moral qualities of the partisan movement of Western Siberia. These negative feelings proved mutual. Later, the insurgent veterans, when talking about G. Eiche's personality, noted that he possessed a biased attitude and inveterate  illness of a prejudice against partisans. The present research enabled to come to a conclusion that the negative perception of partisans by the commander of the 5th army had indeed taken place. However, it was not a result of his arbitrariness or prejudice, but, instead, was quite a well-grounded and, in many respects, just opinion of a military specialist.	2.0
Categories often have unobservable diagnostic features. For example, if a person is a lawyer, one might expect him to be both well dressed and knowledgeable about the law. However, without observing the person in a courtroom, one cannot tell whether or not he is knowledgeable about the law. How might we categorize the well-dressed person before we know whether or not he possesses a particular category feature? Two studies showed that, all else equal, individuals prefer to group exemplars into categories that specify fewer unobserved and unobservable features-i.e., those that have a narrower latent scope to those with a broader latent scope. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to classify novel exemplars as part of a social category that had a narrower latent scope in a verbal task. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the scope bias generalizes to contexts in which category structure is never explicitly specified. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.2
This paper presents HAMSTER, the HeAlthy, Mobility and Security based data communication archiTEctuRe. HAMSTER is designed for Unmanned Vehicles and addresses mainly three types of communications: machine-to-machine, machine-to-infrastructure and internal machine communications. It is divided into three main versions: Flying HAMSTER (for aerial systems), Running HAMSTER (for terrestrial systems) and Swimming HAMSTER (for aquatic systems). Every version of such architecture is also equipped with Sphere and Nimble. Sphere deals with Safety & Security aspects regarding communication, components health and modules authentication. Nimble is aimed at increasing the overall mobility in such scenarios, strongly actuating with inherent communications of each application field. This paper details every aspect of HAMSTER and presents, as a plus at the end, two case studies: the first one consists of an evaluation of five communications schemes for internal communications in airplanes; the second one is a cryptographic evaluation of two Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms.	0.3
Background. Observational associations between cannabis and schizophrenia are well documented, but ascertaining causation is more challenging. We used Mendelian randomization (MR), utilizing publicly available data as a method for ascertaining causation from observational data. Method. We performed bi-directional two-sample MR using summary-level genome-wide data from the International Cannabis Consortium (ICC) and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC2). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cannabis initiation (p < 10(-5)) and schizophrenia (p < 5 x 10(-8)) were combined using an inverse-varianceweighted fixed-effects approach. We also used height and education genome-wide association study data, representing negative and positive control analyses. Results. There was some evidence consistent with a causal effect of cannabis initiation on risk of schizophrenia [ odds ratio (OR) 1.04 per doubling odds of cannabis initiation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.07, p = 0.019]. There was strong evidence consistent with a causal effect of schizophrenia risk on likelihood of cannabis initiation (OR 1.10 per doubling of the odds of schizophrenia, 95% CI 1.05-1.14, p = 2.64 x 10(-5)). Findings were as predicted for the negative control (height: OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99-1.01, p = 0.90) but weaker than predicted for the positive control (years in education: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.00, p = 0.066) analyses. Conclusions. Our results provide some evidence that cannabis initiation increases the risk of schizophrenia, although the size of the causal estimate is small. We find stronger evidence that schizophrenia risk predicts cannabis initiation, possibly as genetic instruments for schizophrenia are stronger than for cannabis initiation.	6.4
Co-occurrence of substance use disorders (SUDs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is extremely common and is associated with elevated dropout and relapse rates. Given that PTSD/SUD co-occurrence rates among veterans have been found to be as high as 55-75%, it is important to identify mechanisms that may affect the interplay of both disorders. Emotion dysregulation (ED) presents a candidate mechanism that may underlie poor treatment response in co-occurring PTSD/SUD. This article proposes a transdiagnostic emotion regulation framework that considers ED conceptualized as a combination of low ability to tolerate emotional distress (low distress tolerance) and difficulties in the goal-directed use of emotion regulation strategies as a key risk factor in co-occurring PTSD/SUD. The authors review empirical findings from self-report and laboratory-based studies of ED in PTSD. They describe psychological explanations of the emotion-substance relationship and review studies documenting ED in SUDs and in co-occurring PTSD/SUD. The literature on ED in PTSD/SUD suggests that (a) patients with PTSD may resort to substances to cope with trauma-related symptoms due to ED, and (b) ED may maintain SUD symptoms and interfere with psychological treatment. Longitudinal studies on bidirectional relationships between ED and substance use in PTSD are needed, particularly research examining the course of ED in PTSD patients who use substances versus those who do not.	5.4
We examined the association between kleptomania and addictive disorders, including behavioral addictions. Fifty-three individuals with a diagnosis of kleptomania completed measures of kleptomania severity, semi structured clinical interviews to assess co-morbid diagnosis of addictive disorders, and the Shorter PROMIS Questionnaire (SPQ) assessing an array of addictive behaviors. 20.75% of the sample met criteria for an addictive disorder; four for a substance use disorder and four for a behavioral addiction. Kleptomania severity was significantly associated with compulsive work and shopping measured by the SPQ. The results suggest the need to assess a wide array of addictive behaviors in individuals with kleptomania.	5.0
LCL filters have been widely used for grid-connected inverters. However, the problem that how time delay affects the stability of digitally controlled grid-connected inverters with LCL filters has not been fully studied. In this paper, a systematic study is carried out on the relationship between the time delay and stability of single-loop controlled grid-connected inverters that employ inverter current feedback (ICF) or grid current feedback (GCF). The ranges of time delay for system stability are analyzed and deduced in the continuous s-domain and discrete z-domain. It is shown that in the optimal range, the existence of time delay weakens the stability of the ICF loop, whereas a proper time delay is required for the GCF loop. The present work explains, for the first time, why different conclusions on the stability of ICF loop and GCF loop have been drawn in previous studies. To improve system stability, a linear predictor-based time delay reduction method is proposed for ICF, while a time delay addition method is used for GCF. A controller design method is then presented that guarantees adequate stability margins. The delay-dependent stability study is verified by simulation and experiment.	1.4
Deficits in social interaction are hallmarks of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Here, we show that the loss of dendritic cell factor I (Dcf1) in the nervous system of mice induces social interaction deficiency, autism-like behaviour, and influences social interaction via the dopamine system. Dopamine receptor D1 agonist rescues this social cognition phenotype, and improves short-term plasticity. Together, this study presents a new genetic mechanism that affects social interaction and may provide a new way to improve positive social interaction and treat autism spectrum disorders.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

When asked to pick a typical human, people are more likely to pick a man than a woman, a phenomenon reflecting androcentrism. Social media websites provide a relevant context in which to study androcentrism since many websites aim to provide users with an ostensibly gender-neutral icon if users do not upload one of their own images. In our first study, 50 male and female online participants (M-age = 35.70) rated whether actual avatar icons from highly trafficked social media websites are perceived as gender-neutral. Using bi-polar scales from woman to man participants reported that overall the icons appeared to be more male-typed than gender neutral. In Study 2, we investigated whether adding more female-typed icons would discourage or promote androcentric thinking. An online sample of 608 male and female participants (M-age = 33.76) viewed either 12 avatar icons that reflected the over-representation of male-typed icons or 12 that included an equal number of male and female-typed icons. Participants were then asked to produce an example of a typical person. Finally, we measured political ideology on two liberal-conservative scales. We found evidence that exposure to an equal number of male-typed and female-typed avatar icons generated reactance among political conservatives, and thus may have constituted an ideological threat. Conservatives who saw an equal number of male-typed and female-typed icons were twice as likely to come up with a man as a typical person compared to conservatives who saw an over-representation of male-typed avatar icons. Consistent with system justification theory, these findings show how male-centric thinking is also evident in a seemingly gender-neutral online context.	2.0
In this paper, we propose a client-server based framework that alleviates the dissemination of XSS worms from the OSN. The framework initially creates the views corresponding to retrieved request on the server-side. Such views indicate that which part of the generated web page on the server can be accessed by user depending on the generated Access Control List (ACL). Secondly, JavaScript attack vectors are retrieved from the HTTP response by referring the blacklist repository of attack vectors. Finally, injection of sanitization primitives will be done on the client-side in place of extracted JavaScript attack vectors. The framework will perform the sanitization on such attack vectors strictly in a context-aware manner. The experimental testing of our framework has performed on the two platforms of open source OSN-based web applications. The observed detection rate of JavaScript attack vectors was effective and acceptable as compared to other existing XSS defensive methodologies. The proposed framework has optimized the method of auto-context-aware sanitization in contrast to other existing approaches and hence incurs a low and acceptable performance overhead.	0.2
A numerical model is used to estimate the service life and clogging of gravel leachate drainage layers with a filter separator layer, such as those used in municipal solid waste landfills. A filter separator layer between the waste and the drainage layer is shown to reduce the leachate strength entering the gravel drainage layer and to extend the time that it takes to clog the drainage layer to the point when the leachate level exceeds the maximum design value (the service life). The filter layer is shown to have a far more significant effect in extending the service life when pea gravel () is used in the drainage layer, and less effect when coarse gravel () is used in the cases examined, although most of the benefit of a filter separator layer was achieved by using a 3-mm-thick needle-punched nonwoven geotextile. This geotextile may be sufficient for many practical purposes that are similar to those examined. The results from modeling leachate collection systems with filter separator layers subjected to both constant and variable leachate strength show that the characteristics of the leachate entering the drainage layer can substantially affect the service life of the drainage layer, and that high-strength leachate entering the systems for a limited time early in the life (acid phase) of a landfill can greatly reduce the service life of the leachate drainage layer.	4.1
Permutation polynomials over finite fields play important roles in finite fields theory. They also have wide applications in many areas of science and engineering such as coding theory, cryptography, combinatorial design, communication theory and so on. Permutation binomials and permutation trinomials attract people's interest due to their simple algebraic forms and additional extraordinary properties. In this paper, we find a new result about permutation binomials and construct several new classes of permutation trinomials. Some of them are generalizations of known ones.

The aim of regenerative medicine is replacing missing or damaged bone tissues with synthetic grafts based on porous interconnected scaffolds, which allow adhesion, growth, and proliferation of the human cells. The optimal design of such scaffolds, in the Bone Tissue Engineering field, should meet several geometrical requirements. First, they have to be customized to replicate the skeletal anatomy of the patient, and then they have to provide the proper trabecular structure to be successfully populated by the cells. Therefore, for modelling such scaffolds, specific design methods are needed to conceive extremely complex structures by controlling both macro and micro shapes. For this purpose, in the last years, the Computer Aided Design of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces has received considerable attention, since their presence in natural shapes and structures. In this work, we propose a method that exploit Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces as unit cell for the development of customized trabecular scaffolds. The aim is to identify the mathematical parameters of these surfaces in order to obtain the target requirements of the bone grafts. For that reason, the method is implemented through a Generative Design tool that allow to interactively controlling both the porosity and the pores size of the scaffolds.	3.0
Understanding the causes of human behavior is essential for advancing one's interests and for coordinating social relations. The scientific study of how people arrive at such understandings or explanations has unfolded in four distinguishable epochs in psychology, each characterized by a different metaphor that researchers have used to represent how people think as they attribute causality and blame to other individuals. The first epoch was guided by an intuitive scientist metaphor, which emphasized whether observers perceived behavior to be caused by the unique tendencies of the actor or by common reactions to the requirements of the situation. This metaphor was displaced in the second epoch by an intuitive lawyer depiction that focused on the need to hold people responsible for their misdeeds. The third epoch was dominated by theories of counterfactual thinking, which conveyed a person as reconstructor approach that emphasized the antecedents and consequences of imagining alternatives to events, especially harmful ones. With the current upsurge in moral psychology, the fourth epoch emphasizes the moral-evaluative aspect of causal judgment, reflected in a person as moralist metaphor. By tracing the progression from the person-environment distinction in early attribution theories to present concerns with moral judgment, our goal is to clarify how causal constructs have been used, how they relate to one another, and what unique attributional problems each addresses.	2.2
Eye gaze is a powerful signal, which exerts a mixture of arousal, attentional, and social effects on the observer. We recently found a behavioural interaction between eye contact and mimicry where direct gaze rapidly enhanced mimicry of hand movements ). Here, we report two detailed investigations of this effect. In Experiment 1, we compared the effects of direct gaze, averted gaze, and gaze to the acting hand on mimicry and manipulated the sequence of gaze events within a trial. Only direct gaze immediately before the hand action enhanced mimicry. In Experiment 2, we examined the enhancement of mimicry when direct gaze is followed by a blink or by shut eyes, or by occluded eyes. Enhanced mimicry relative to baseline was seen only in the blink condition. Together, these results suggest that ongoing social engagement is necessary for enhanced mimicry. These findings allow us to place the gaze-enhancement effect in the context of other reported gaze phenomena. We suggest that this effect is similar to previously reported audience effects, but is less similar to ostensive cueing effects. This has important implications for our theories of the relationships between social cues and imitation.	2.2
This paper presents a nonintrusive method to automatically identify and compensate for current measurement errors in interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives. Each IPM motor has a distinct short-circuit current vs. speed characteristic, which is solely defined by its machine design. By controlling the IPM motor to operate at its steady-state short-circuit current during coasting down, all phases of the IPM motor can be safely short circuited using the inverter without introducing any current transients. Then the d-q axis currents measured by the inverter are compared with the known short-circuit characteristic of the IPM motor. The distortion pattern in the d-q axis currents contains all the information needed to correct for current sensor errors in IPMSM drives.	3.3
The Passive Moderator Cooling System (PMCS) of the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor is designed to remove heat from the moderator passively in case of an extended station black out condition (SBO). The hot heavy-water moderator inside the Calandria rises upward due to buoyancy, cooled in a shell and tube heat exchanger (located within the loop) and returns back to the Calandria, completing a natural circulation loop. The heat exchanger, in turn, is cooled by water from a Gravity Driven Water Pool (GDWP); forming a second loop. This coupled natural circulation loop system provides sufficient cooling to prevent the increase of moderator temperature inside the Calandria vessel beyond safe limits during SBO. The feasibility of such a system should be assessed before it is implemented in the reactor. Thus, a scaled test facility was set up to simulate the thermal hydraulic characteristics of the PMCS. A set of time varying power experiments were performed, which capture the flow initiation from rest phenomena and the multidimensional natural convection flow in a coupled natural circulation system. Next, the experimental geometry was simulated using the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code (OpenFoam 2.2.0), which predicted temperature and flow distribution inside the system. The CFD results agree well with the experimental data within +/- 6%. The flow initiation phenomena shows that the initial flow generated recirculates within the Calandria, after similar to 900 s the flow is able to come out of the Calandria. The experiments show a time lag between the starting of the primary and secondary loop circulation. This work demonstrates the experimental and computational capability to understand and design an effective Passive Moderator Cooling System. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.1
A nonlinear dynamic coupled model for hydropower station system, which contains the model of water-carriage system, water turbine system, speed governor system, generator's electromagnetic system, grid, shaft system of hydroelectric generating set, as well as the powerhouse, is established in this paper. Firstly, the simultaneous differential equations for coupled hydraulic-mechanical-electric transient process are set up based upon the theories of hydraulics, electrical machinery, etc., while the coupled structural models for shaft system of unit and powerhouse are built by means of finite element method. Secondly, a new method for investigating nonlinear dynamic properties of structures influenced by coupled hydraulic-mechanical-electric factors in different conditions is introduced with the help of user-programmable features from Ansys software. Finally, in order to verify the rationality, several numerical calculation methods are used to study the starting-up process of hydropower station. The results indicate that the model presented in this paper is adoptable for simulating specified condition and reflect the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of hydropower station comprehensively. In addition, the model can also be used to assess the operation safety and predict the structures reliability of hydropower station system, so as to provide some profitable reference for dynamic regulation during limited and transient conditions for hydropower station.	3.1
The increasing prevalence of food allergies and the intake of packing foods in the past two decades urge the need for more rapid, accurate, and sensitive assays to detect potential allergens in food in order to control the allergen content. Most of the commercial analytical tools for allergen detection rely on immunoassays such as ELISA. As far as disadvantages, ELISA can be time-consuming and expensive. Biosensors appear as a suitable alternative for the detection of allergens because they are rapid, highly sensitive, selective, less expensive, environmentally friendly, and easy to handle. In this study, we developed a microfluidic system integrated with a quantum dots (Qdots) aptamer functionalized graphene oxide (GO) nano-biosensor for simple, rapid, and sensitive food allergen detection. The biosensor utilized Qdots-aptamer-GO complexes as probes to undergo conformational change upon interaction with the food allergens, resulting in fluorescence changes due to the fluorescence quenching and recovering properties of GO by adsorption and desorption of aptamer-conjugated Qdots. This one-step 'turn on' homogenous assay in a ready-to-use microfluidic chip took similar to 10 min to achieve a quantitative detection of Ara h 1, one of the major allergens appearing in peanuts. The results suggested this system had remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. The integration of a microfluidics platform in a homemade miniaturized optical analyzer provides a promising way for the rapid, cost-effective, and accurate on-site determination of food allergens. This biosensor can also be extended to the detection of other food allergens with a selection of corresponding aptamers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	5.1
Plenty of design parameters are used during electric machine design process. Generally, design parameters are looked up from existing curves drawn by magnetic field graphing method or analytical method. Affected by different draftsmen's proficiency, precision of parameter curves drawn by magnetic field graphing method have uncertainty. Using analytical drawing method to draw design parameter curves usually simplifies analytical model of electric machine to improve calculating efficiency. But simplified analysis model results in more or less accuracy problems. In order to improve the accuracy of electric machines design calculation, finite element method (FEM) is used to analyze electromagnetic field and calculate design parameters based on complete electric machine model in this paper. As the analytic objects are a series of 300MW evaporative cooled generator-motor, design parameter curves drawn in this paper should be more accurate than existing curves for electric machine with similar size and structure.	3.3
The rapid development of energy, electricity, and transportation industries has created a market for steel pipes; however, buried steel pipelines near high-voltage transmission lines and electrified railways often experience alternating current (AC) corrosion at the damaged coating of pipelines; such phenomenon is mostly due to the resistance between the capacitance and inductance coupling, especially for long-distance pipelines in parallel operation. AC corrosion can cause pipeline corrosion perforation and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in some cases, which has been a vital threat to the pipeline safety. In this work, the influence of AC on corrosion behavior of X80 pipeline steel was investigated in NS4 near-neutral solution by data acquisition technique, electrochemical test, immersion tests and surface analysis techniques. Results show that with the increasing of AC density, corrosion morphology changed from uniform corrosion to localized corrosion with many pits. Under the full AC interference, X80 steel occurred cathodic and anodic polarization which resulted in iron dissolution and hydrogen precipitation. The negative half wave AC would lead to hydrogen evolution and hydrogen induced anodic dissolution, the pits in X80 steel surface present sharp. However, under disturbance of positive half-wave AC, only anodic dissolution occurred and the pitting appeared spill shape and smoothly. Under various AC waveform interference, the corrosion products of X80 steel surface were different. Under full AC wave and positive half-wave interference, the corrosion products were loose, had have no alpha-FeOOH and occurred cracks; however, under negative half-wave AC interference, the corrosion products were denser and contained alpha-FeOOH which has protective effect on substrates.	1.0
Introduction: Obesity is a serious public health problem in Mexico, the National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT 2012) reported a 34.4% prevalence of overweight, and obesity in children aged 5-11. Recent research has suggested that the gut microbiota may be a risk factor of obesity through its influence on human metabolism. Aim of the study: To evaluate association between the intestinal microbiota profile and obesity among children and whether this association is modified depending on the feeding pattern of a sample of schoolchildren from Mexico City. Metodology and Results: Cross-sectional study on 1042 children aged 6-14 years; physical activity questionnaire, personal medical history and heredofamilial of obesity and type 2 diabetes were administered to all the children. Eating patterns was performed by principal component analysis (PCA). The association between intestinal microbiota and overweight / obesity depending on diet was assessed with logistic regression models. Conclusion: Our results shows that the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and diet, particularly high in fats and simple carbohydrates increases the chance of developing obesity.	6.2
BACKGROUND: Home-based interventions to improve indoor air quality have demonstrated benefits for asthma morbidity, yet little is known about the effect of environmental interventions in the school setting. OBJECTIVE: We piloted the feasibility and effectiveness of a classroom-based air cleaner intervention to reduce particulate pollutants in classrooms of children with asthma. METHODS: In this pilot randomized controlled trial, we assessed the effect of air cleaners on indoor air particulate pollutant concentrations in 18 classrooms (9 control, 9 intervention) in 3 urban elementary schools. We enrolled 25 children with asthma (13 control, 12 intervention) aged 6 to 10 years. Classroom air pollutant measurements and spirometry were completed once before and twice after randomization. Asthma symptoms were surveyed every 3 months. RESULTS: Baseline classroom levels of fine particulate matter (particulate matter with diameter of <2.5 mu m [PM2.5]) and black carbon (BC) were 6.3 and 0.41 mu g/m(3), respectively. When comparing the intervention to the control group, classroom PM2.5 levels were reduced by 49% and 42% and BC levels were reduced by 58% and 55% in the first and second follow-up periods, respectively (P<.05 for all comparisons). When comparing the children randomized to intervention and control classrooms, there was a modest improvement in peak flow, but no significant changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and asthma symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, a classroom-based air cleaner intervention led to significant reductions in PM2.5 and BC. Future large-scale studies should comprehensively evaluate the effect of school-based environmental interventions on pediatric asthma morbidity.

Triclosan (TCS) is a broad spectrum antibacterial agent present as an active ingredient in some personal care products such as soaps, toothpastes and sterilizers. It is an endocrine disrupting compound and its increasing presence in water resources as well as in biosolid-amended soils used in farming, its potential for bioaccumulation in fatty tissues and toxicity in aquatic organisms are a cause for concern to human and environmental health. TCS has also been detected in blood, breast milk, urine and nails of humans. The significance of this is not precisely understood. Data on its bioaccumulation in humans are also lacking. Cell based studies however showed that TCS is a pro-oxidant and may be cytotoxic via a number of mechanisms. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation appears to be prevailing as a toxicity mechanism though the compound's role in apoptosis has been cited. TCS is not known to be carcinogenic per se in vitro but has been reported to promote tumourigenesis in the presence of a carcinogen, in mice. Recent laboratory reports appear to support the view that TCS oestrogenicity as well as its anti-oestrogenicity play significant role in cancer progression. Results from epidemiological studies on the effect of TCS on human health have implicated the compound as responsible for certain allergies and reproductive defects. Its presence in chlorinated water also raises toxicity concern for humans as carcinogenic metabolites such as chlorophenols may be generated in the presence of the residual chlorine. In this paper, we carried out a detailed overview of TCS pollution and the implications for human and environmental health.	5.1
Microgravity experiments are essential for research in space science, biology, fluid mechanics, combustion, and material sciences. One way to conduct microgravity experiments on Earth is by using drop tower facilities. These facilities combine a high quality of microgravity, adequate payload masses and have the advantage of virtually unlimited repeatability under same experimental conditions, at a low cost. In a collaboration between the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at the University of Stuttgart and Baylor University (BU) in Waco, Texas, a new drop tower is currently under development at the Center for Astrophysics, Space Physics and Engineering Research (CASPER). The design parameters of the drop tower ask for at least 1.5 sin free fall duration while providing a quality of at least 10(-5) g. Previously, this quality has only been achieved in vacuum drop tower facilities where the capsule experiences virtually zero aerodynamic drag during its free fall. Since this design comes at high costs, a different drop tower design concept, which does not require an evacuated drop shaft, was chosen. It features a dual-capsule system in which the experiment capsule is shielded from aerodynamic forces by surrounding it with a drag shield during the drop. As no other dual-capsule drop tower has been able to achieve a quality as good as or better than 10-5 g previous work optimized the design with an aerodynamic perspective by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to determine the ideal shape and size of the outer capsule and to specify the aerodynamically crucial dimensions for the overall system. Experiments later demonstrated that the required quality of microgravity can be met with the proposed design. The main focus of this paper is the mechanical realization of the capsule as well as the development and layout of the surrounding components, such as the release mechanism, the deceleration device and the drop shaft. Because the drop tower facility is a complex system with many interdependencies between all of the components, several engineering challenges had to be addressed. For example, initial disturbances that are caused by the release mechanism are a common issue that arises at drop tower facilities. These vibrations may decrease the quality of microgravity during the initial segment of free fall. Because this would reduce the free fall time experiencing high quality microgravity, a mechanism has been developed to provide a soft release. Challenges and proposed solutions for all components are highlighted in this paper.	3.4
Penconazole is a widely used fungicide in the UK; however, to date, there have been no peer-reviewed publications reporting human metabolism, excretion or biological monitoring data. The objectives of this study were to i) develop a robust analytical method, ii) determine biomarker levels in volunteers exposed to penconazole, and, finally, to iii) measure the metabolites in samples collected as part of a large investigation of rural residents' exposure. An LC-MS/MS method was developed for penconazole and two oxidative metabolites. Three volunteers received a single oral dose of 0.03 mg/kg body weight and timed urine samples were collected and analysed. The volunteer study demonstrated that both penconazole-OH and penconazole-COOH are excreted in humans following an oral dose and are viable biomarkers. Excretion is rapid with a half-life of less than four hours. Mean recovery of the administered dose was 47% (range 33%-54%) in urine treated with glucuronidase to hydrolyse any conjugates. The results from the residents' study showed that levels of penconazole-COOH in this population were low with >80% below the limit of detection. Future sampling strategies that include both end of exposure and next day urine samples, as well as contextual data about the route and time of exposure, are recommended.	6.2
Vision-based object detection is essential for a multitude of robotic applications. However, it is also a challenging job due to the diversity of the environments in which such applications are required to operate, and the strict constraints that apply to many robot systems in terms of run-time, power and space. To meet these special requirements of robotic applications, we propose an efficient deep network for vision-based object detection. More specifically, for a given image captured by a robot mount camera, we first introduce a novel proposal layer to efficiently generate potential object bounding-boxes. The proposal layer consists of efficient on-line convolutions and effective off-line optimization. Afterwards, we construct a robust detection layer which contains a multiple population genetic algorithm-based convolutional neural network (MPGA-based CNN) module and a TLD-based multi-frame fusion procedure. Unlike most deep learning based approaches, which rely on GPU, all of the on-line processes in our system are able to run efficiently without GPU support. We perform several experiments to validate each component of our proposed object detection approach and compare the approach with some recently published state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on widely used datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits high efficiency and robustness in object detection tasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.0
Water scarcity increasingly constrains agricultural production, particularly for rice, one of our most important food crops. Conventional paddy production is the world's largest single consumer of water. Making certain changes in current cultivation practices, as discussed here, can raise rice crop yields while reducing water and other inputs. Diminished greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, less runoff water pollution, and more climate-resilience are additional benefits. Spreading such changes in crop and water management within the rice sector can be a cost-effective response to agricultural water shortages, offering improvement in food security, adaptability to climate change, and environmental sustainability.

Lexicographic preferences on a set of attributes provide a cognitively plausible structure for modeling the behavior of human decision makers. Therefore, the induction of corresponding models from revealed preferences or observed decisions constitutes an interesting problem from a machine learning point of view. In this paper, we introduce a learning algorithm for inducing generalized lexicographic preference models from a given set of training data, which consists of pairwise comparisons between objects. Our approach generalizes simple lexicographic orders in the sense of allowing the model to consider several attributes simultaneously (instead of looking at them one by one), thereby significantly increasing the expressiveness of the model class. In order to evaluate our method, we present a case study of a highly complex real-world problem, namely the choice of the recognition method for actuarial gains and losses from occupational pension schemes. Using a unique sample of European companies, this problem is well suited for demonstrating the effectiveness of our lexicographic ranker. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark data from the machine learning domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
Recently, using compressive sensing (CS) as a cryptosystem has drawn attention due to its compressibility and low-complexity during the sampling process. However, when applying such cryptosystem to images, how to protect the privacy of the image while keeping efficiency becomes a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel image coding scheme that achieves combined compression and encryption under a parallel compressive sensing framework, where both the CS sampling and the CS reconstruction are performed in parallel. In this way, the efficiency can be guaranteed. On the other hand, for security, the resistance to chosen plaintext attack (CPA) is realized with the help of the cooperation between a nonlinear chaotic sensing matrix construction process and a counter mode operation. Furthermore, the defect of energy information leakage in CS-based cryptosystem is also overcome by a diffusion procedure. Experimental and analysis results show the scheme achieves effectiveness, efficiency and high security simultaneously. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	0.3
While planning resource management systems in rural areas, it is important to consider criteria that are specific to the local social conditions. Such criteria might change from one region to another and are hence best identified using a participatory approach. In this work, we propose a participatory framework to identify such criteria and derive their weights. These identified criteria and their weights are used as parameters to develop a quantitative model for evaluating efficiency of each system. Such a model can serve as a support tool for stakeholders to simulate and analyze what-if scenarios, evaluate alternatives, and select one which best satisfies their requirements. We use existing systems to test the model by comparing efficiencies evaluated by the model to efficiencies perceived by the stakeholders. The model is calibrated by repeating the process until statistically significant correlation is achieved between evaluated and perceived efficiencies. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in treating efficiencies perceived by the stakeholders as the ground truth since they know these systems well and are their ultimate users. The framework is successfully demonstrated using case study of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in an Indian village. The resulting calibrated model can be used to plan new RWH systems in this region and similar regions elsewhere. The framework can be used to plan other resource management systems in various regions.	4.3
The aim of the paper is to present a specific context for the occurrence of sexual problems, i.e., sexual dysfunction in the population of homo - and bisexual men. Sexual problems and revealing them are usually a big challenge for men. In case of homo - and bisexual men additional psychological and social factors may contribute to the occurrence of these problems, as well as make experiencing them more painful, but also impede looking for and receiving an adequate help. These factors are connected to the specific features of gay men sexuality, such as: lack of obvious sexual scripts for homosexual men, full reversibility of all sexual roles and positions in contacts between two men or no fear of unwanted pregnancy, but also with the unique psychosocial context such as: minority stress and internalized homophobia. Clinicians - psychiatrists, sexologists and psychologists - should be aware of their existence to deliver a more effective professional and culturally competent care, which is free of prejudice, based on deepened reflection and void of automatic transference of experiences with work with heterosexual men.

Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most common emerging disease in developing countries. It alters endothelial cell structure and function, resulting in several diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, peripheral vasculopathy, cerebrovascular disease and nephropathy. Although much progress has been made in researching HTN in recent years, early diagnosis and treatment of HTN are not yet satisfactory, and progression control/treatment is still poor. MicroRNAs are well-known regulators of the physiological and developmental processes of HTN. Our results revealed that miR-510 was upregulated in blood samples from HTN patients, whereas no significant differences were observed in the control samples. Methylation analyses corroborated the miR-510 upregulation in patient samples. These results suggested that miR-510 can be used as a novel biomarker for diagnosis and as a new therapeutic target for HTN.	6.4
Nowadays, production enterprises are faced with an array of challenges including increasing pressure regarding costs, demands for individualized products as well as the growing significance of logistic performance and costs, to name just a few. These in turn give rise to special requirements that the production planning, control and monitoring, among others, need to meet with suitable methods and techniques. Within this context, developments such as Industry 4.0 and cyber-physical production systems on the technology side, and approaches such as innovative learning factories for training employees hold great potential. This paper clarifies the advantages of cyber-physical systems in view of production planning, controlling and monitoring. Based on that, using the concept of IFA's Learning Factory, it describes how these can be specifically utilized in applying logistic models to improve order processing. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Purpose: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to evaluate the clinical performance of ceramicveneered zirconia frameworks. Materials and Methods: Patients were recruited according to defined inclusion criteria. All patients were checked every 4 months from the time of definitive rehabilitation. At the end of 2013, all patients were rescheduled and rechecked for study purposes. The restorative procedures assessment was performed by previously established methods. The primary outcomes were the survival and success rates of the prosthesis. Descriptive statistics were used for the patient's demographics, implant distribution, and occurrence of complications. To study the survival and success of the prostheses, a Cox Regression analysis was used with a model constructed in a forward conditional stepwise mode. Predictive variables were included in the model, and adjusted survival curves were obtained for each outcome. Results: From 2008 to 2013, 75 patients were rehabilitated with 92 implant-supported, screw-retained, full-arch ceramic-veneered zirconia framework rehabilitations. The range of follow-up was between 6 months and 5 years. From the 92 full implant-supported screw-retained full-arch rehabilitations, Cox regression analysis indicated that within a 5-year time frame, the probability of framework fracture, major chipping, minor chipping, or any of the former combined to occur was 17.6%, 46.5%, 69.2%, and 90.5%, respectively. Conclusion: Results suggest zirconia as a suitable material for framework structure in implant-supported, full-arch rehabilitations. However, it experiences a high incidence of technical complications, mainly due to ceramic chipping. Further clinical studies should aim to ascertain the effects of clinical features and manufacturing procedures on the survival rates of these prostheses.	3.0
Moving beyond the distinction between biological and social facts has proved challenging due to several basic methodological and ontological differences among scientific disciplines. The aim of this paper is to show how attention schema theory (hereafter AST), developed by Michael Graziano, provides a useful addition to existing integrative approaches that can be used to overcome impediments to interdisciplinary crossfertilization, such that the influence of a range of interconnected institutional, situational, biographical, psychological, neural and genetic variables can be considered simultaneously in a parsimonious way. The paper provides an overview of three basic methodological and ontological differences dividing scientists researching human nature and society. It then draws on AST and a selection of existing approaches in the interdisciplinary vein to demonstrate how to move beyond the reductionist tendencies of each discipline. In the view of AST, intrinsic brain processes and social and situational aspects are intricately intertwined and continuously influence each other in shaping specific attentional focuses. Social identities, biographical experiences, symbols, roles and subject positions contribute to directing attention to certain kinds of stimuli, details, or information, while at the same time, intrinsic predispositions make individuals inclined to attend to different types of information. By accounting for the brain basis of awareness as a subjective experience, AST can be used to clarify how social identities influence attention, and thus, the linkages between individual cognition and wider institutional structures. Finally, the paper considers the relationships between the cognitive and the institutional levels of analysis, and highlights the importance of the latter as a distinct level of analysis. In this way, the paper charts the multidirectional and interactive causal relationship between intrinsic brain processes, attention and conscious awareness, and how they relate to wider institutional structures and joint attentional interactions at higher levels of aggregation.	2.1
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly Culex spp. and Aedes/Ochlerotatus spp., which acquire the virus by feeding on viraemic birds. Humans, horses and other mammals are regarded as incidental or dead-end hosts. In the last decades, an increasing number of cases of WNV infection in horses and humans have been notified in the Mediterranean basin. In Tunisia, human cases of WNV-related meningoencephalitis were detected in 1997, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Based on the analysis of climatic and environmental conditions found in the locations where human cases have been reported in 2012, the aim of this study was to identify similar areas in Tunisia potentially at risk of disease occurrence. Data related to 85 neuroinvasive West Nile fever (WNF) human cases were georeferenced and a set of environmental and climatic variables (wetlands and humid areas, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperatures and elevation, migratory bird settlements) were used in the analysis. Areas, ecologically similar to those where human cases were detected, were identified using the Mahalanobis distance statistic. A leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the sensitivity of the model, and 78 of 85 points were correctly classified.	4.2
The aim of this paper is to propose a neural network based reference modified PID control which has a simple duration design method for transient characteristics improvement of digitally controlled dc-dc converters. In renewable energy network systems, various types of dc-dc converters are widely used for power conversion and such converters require a superior control method for a stable operation. Especially, transient characteristics should be improved since they heavily affect the stability of the system. For such purposes, designing of conventional control methods becomes a difficult task since the optimization of control parameters needs complicated analysis and it is affected from variations of circuit components of converters. Therefore, simple and easy design of control is widely required for a stable operation of power converters. The neural network can provide a suitable control methodology for such situation since it treats the plant as a black box and it can realize a non-linear control based on training of the input-output relation without complicated modelling and analysis. On the other hand, the neural network based method has a disadvantage caused from the fact that the neural network is trained with data obtained in advance and an overcompensation phenomenon occurs in the transient response. In this paper, the neural network control is adopted to control the dc-dc converter in coordination with a conventional PID control. The neural network predicts the output voltage of the converter and the reference value in the PID control is modified with the predictions to reduce the error of the output voltage. To avoid overcompensation, a simple duration design for the neural network control is also provided to improve the transient response effectively. From prototype testing in simulation and experiment, it is revealed that the proposed method contributes to obtain a superior transient performance compared with the conventional PID control.	1.4
A lower bone mass accompanied by a higher bone fragility with increased risk of fracture are observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Low C-peptide levels are associated with low lumbar mineral density in postmenopausal woman. In this work, we investigated the role of C-peptide on the osteoblast cell biology in vitro. We examined intracellular pathways and we found that C peptide activates ERK1/2 in human osteoblast-like cells (Saos-2). We also observed that proinsulin C-peptide prevents a reduction of type I collagen expression and decreases, in combination with insulin, receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANKL) levels. In this work we show for the first time that Cpeptide activates a specific intracellular pathway in osteoblasts and it modulates the expression of protein involved in bone remodeling. Our results suggest that both C-peptide may have a role in bone metabolism. Further studies are needing to fully clarify its role. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.1
Confirmation of pregnancy viability (presence of fetal cardiac activity) and diagnosis of fetal presentation (head or buttock in the maternal pelvis) are the first essential components of ultrasound assessment in obstetrics. The former is useful in assessing the presence of an on-going pregnancy and the latter is essential for labour management. We propose an automated framework for detection of fetal presentation and heartbeat from a predefined free-hand ultrasound sweep of the maternal abdomen. Our method exploits the presence of key anatomical sonographic image patterns in carefully designed scanning protocols to develop, for the first time, an automated framework allowing novice sonographers to detect fetal breech presentation and heartbeat from an ultrasound sweep. The framework consists of a classification regime for a frame by frame categorization of each 2D slice of the video. The classification scores are then regularized through a conditional random field model, taking into account the temporal relationship between the video frames. Subsequently, if consecutive frames of the fetal heart are detected, a kernelized linear dynamical model is used to identify whether a heartbeat can be detected in the sequence. In a dataset of 323 predefined free-hand videos, covering the mother's abdomen in a straight sweep, the fetal skull, abdomen, and heart were detected with a mean classification accuracy of 83.4%. Furthermore, for the detection of the heartbeat an overall classification accuracy of 93.1% was achieved. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	0.1
This paper summarizes research on the potential of high-resolution imagery downloaded from Google Earth Pro to detect prehistoric canals from the Hohokam Period in the Middle Gila River Valley, Arizona. The potential of the imagery to identify obscured features was evaluated by means of ground truthing reconnaissance as well as a comparative analysis of the Google Earth imagery with the more traditionally employed CORONA and Landsat ETM+ imagery used in analogous studies. This research is presented as a method-based solution to utilize remote sensing in exploratory archaeological research projects facing budget constraints. The conclusion of the research was that Google Earth imagery provided the best spatial resolution for detecting obscured irrigation features compared to the other imagery used. The results of the investigation are summarized as a potential research model applicable in other dryland settings.	4.2
The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a passive point-of-use treatment system, namely, a polyvinyl (alcohol) (PVA) nanofiber membrane/activated carbon column, for the treatment of harvested rainwater. The efficiency of SMI-Q10 [quaternized poly (styrene-co-maleimide)] nanofiber membrane disks placed in a filtration assembly for the treatment of surface water (Plankenburg River, Western Cape, South Africa) and harvested rainwater was also assessed. Two rainwater harvesting tanks were installed at the Welgevallen Experimental farm, Stellenbosch, South Africa, with the filtration system intermittently attached to the tanks for collection of rainwater samples throughout the study period. Parameters used to monitor the filtration systems included heterotrophic bacteria, Escherichia coli, and total coliform enumeration and the presence/absence of adenovirus. When compared to drinking water guidelines, the results indicated that 3 L of potable water could be produced by the synthesized PVA nanofiber membrane/activated carbon column. However, PCR assays indicated that adenovirus and numerous bacteria such as Klebsiella spp., Legionella spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Yersinia spp. were not effectively removed by the filtration system utilized. Additionally, the SMI-Q10 nanofiber membrane disks did not remove viruses from the river or tank water samples as bovine adenovirus 3 strain, simian adenovirus, and human adenovirus A strain were detected in all water samples analyzed. Thus, while the microfiltration system was efficient in reducing the level of indicator organisms to within drinking water standards, further optimization of the electrospun filtration membranes is required as molecular analysis revealed that numerous opportunistic bacterial pathogens and viruses persisted after filtration.	4.3
Cryptanalysis refers to finding the plaintext from the given cipher text. The problem reduces to finding the correct key from a set of possible keys, which is basically a search problem. Many researchers have put in a lot of effort to accomplish this task. Most of the efforts used conventional techniques. However, soft computing techniques like Genetic Algorithms are generally good in optimized search, though the applicability of such techniques to cryptanalysis is still a contentious point. This work carries out an extensive literature review of the cryptanalysis techniques, finds the gaps there in, in order to put the proposed technique in the perspective. The work also finds the applicability of Cellular Automata in cryptanalysis. A new technique has been proposed and verified for texts of around 1000 words. Each text is encrypted 10 times and then decrypted using the proposed technique. The work has also been compared with that employing Genetic Algorithm. The experiments carried out prove the veracity of the technique and paves way of Cellular automata in cryptanalysis. The paper also discusses the future scope of the work.	0.3
Increase in saturation in natural clayey slopes along coastal zones as a result of tsunamis or storm surges may cause flow slides or failures. One of the common treatments is to increase the overall stability by soil replacement and/or re-compaction, which is often difficult to implement, expensive, and, most importantly, damages the natural vegetation. In this paper, remedial effectiveness of a relatively economical and environmentally friendly method involving insertion of geotextile strips with drainage capability into natural clayey slopes is evaluated through a series of centrifuge tests. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the employed technique to increase the stability of slopes and their drainage capability as well as to reduce the deformations under surcharge loadings.	4.1
Research in learning analytics and educational data mining has recently become prominent in the fields of computer science and education. Most scholars in the field emphasize student learning and student data analytics; however, it is also important to focus on teaching analytics and teacher preparation because of their key roles in student learning, especially in K-12 learning environments. Nonverbal communication strategies play an important role in successful interpersonal communication of teachers with their students. In order to assist novice or practicing teachers with exhibiting open and affirmative nonverbal cues in their classrooms, we have designed a multimodal teaching platform with provisions for online feedback. We used an interactive teaching rehearsal software, TeachLivE (TM), as our basic research environment. TeachLivE employs a digital puppetry paradigm as its core technology. Individuals walk into this virtual environment and interact with virtual students displayed on a large screen. They can practice classroom management, pedagogy and content delivery skills with a teaching plan in the TeachLivE environment. We have designed an experiment to evaluate the impact of an online nonverbal feedback application. In this experiment, different types of multimodal data have been collected during two experimental settings. These data include talk-time and nonverbal behaviors of the virtual students, captured in log files; talk time and full body tracking data of the participant; and video recording of the virtual classroom with the participant. 34 student teachers participated in this 30-minute experiment. In each of the settings, the participants were provided with teaching plans from which they taught. All the participants took part in both of the experimental settings. In order to have a balanced experiment design, half of the participants received nonverbal online feedback in their first session and the other half received this feedback in the second session. A visual indication was used for feedback each time the participant exhibited a closed, defensive posture. Based on recorded full-body tracking data, we observed that only those who received feedback in their first session demonstrated a significant number of open postures in the session containing no feedback. However, the post-questionnaire information indicated that all participants were more mindful of their body postures while teaching after they had participated in the study.	2.3
Researching and industrializing a new pharmaceutical form results in an impressive amount of waste due to the methods used. Despite numerous reports about the addition of pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment, the effect they have on the environment at the nanogram (ng) level remains largely unknown; thus, it has been proposed to retain toxic compounds using Dowex resins in biomucoadhesive tablets containing miconazole nitrate, an antifungal medication. This study demonstrates the reduction of water pollution by using pharmaceutical forms of miconazol nitrate anions; at the same time, the proposed method can also re-utilize the anti-fungal substances by recovering them from the ion-changing resins. The pollutant examined in the study was nitrate anions, and the resin was represented by DowexTMNSR-1. Once the pharmaceutical form was disaggregated in distilled water and the resulting solution was filtered through the Dowex resin, chemical test reports were created, and all the parameters had registered values below the allowable wastewater limits. Through the ionic exchange method in this study, up to 99.8% of the anion nitrate ended up as waste during the preparation of new pharmaceutical forms while the antifungal effect was retained. This anion nitrate percentage was confirmed through 10 different determinations of 309 biomucoadhesive miconazol nitrate tablets disaggregated into 1000 mL of distilled water.	4.4
The majority of patients presenting allergic rhinitis and asthma are sensitised to several allergens. Dust mites are the chief culprits, with the two most important species in France being Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae. Studies indicate that 50 to 70% of patients are multi-sensitised. However, it is important to distinguish between sensitisation and allergy: sensitisation is an exclusively biological phenomenon (positive prick-tests or IgE assays), while the term allergy implies the existence of clinical symptoms detectable by precise history taking. Management of dust mite allergies is based upon fastidious elimination of the offending source, suitable symptomatically treatment and allergy immunotherapy (Am, chiefly by the sublingual route (SLIT). Successful elimination of dust mites depends on the degree of patient sensitisation, the extent of exposure to dust mites, the measures taken, and any other allergies and domestic pollutants present. Removal, which is difficult for dust mites, is random in the case of most other allergens (pollens, moulds, cockroaches, etc.). AIT is the only form of treatment able to modify the immune status of allergic individuals and is indicated in cases of poor control of rhinitis and/or asthma by means of global allergen removal or systematic treatments. In multi-allergic patients, where two sources of allergens are required, these may be administered either in parallel (using two allergen preparations) or in a mixture (using a single preparation). When AIT is given in parallel, for example with dust mites and grass pollens, a recommended interval of 30 minutes should be left between the two allergens. Where AIT is performed using a mixture of allergens within a single preparation, it is recommended that the preparation be made up of a 50/50 mixture of mutually compatible allergen sources. The prescription of multiple AIT underlines the importance of the dilution factor: mixing several allergens reduces the doses of each allergen in keeping with the number of components used. SLIT is currently the reference pathway, and practically the only approach utilised in children because of its ease of use, as well as the absence of pain and of any serious adverse effects. It must be performed using high-quality standardised allergen extracts with particular attention to the clinical relevance of the allergens used, their safety of use and the patient's quality of life.(C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Cells release small extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the surrounding media. Upon virus infection cells also release virions that have the same size of some of the EVs. Both virions and EVs carry proteins of the cells that generated them and are antigenically heterogeneous. In spite of their diversity, both viruses and EVs were characterized predominantly by bulk analysis. Here, we describe an original nanotechnology-based high throughput method that allows the characterization of antigens on individual small particles using regular flow cytometers. Viruses or extracellular vesicles were immunocaptured with 15 nm magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coupled to antibodies recognizing one of the surface antigens. The captured virions or vesicles were incubated with fluorescent antibodies against other surface antigens. The resultant complexes were separated on magnetic columns from unbound antibodies and analyzed with conventional flow cytometers triggered on fluorescence. This method has wide applications and can be used to characterize the antigenic composition of any viral-and non-viral small particles generated by cells in vivo and in vitro. Here, we provide examples of the usage of this method to evaluate the distribution of host cell markers on individual HIV-1 particles, to study the maturation of individual Dengue virions (DENV), and to investigate extracellular vesicles released into the bloodstream.	6.3
The emerging Internet of Things opens endless possibilities to the contemporary notion of smart offices, where employees can benefit for automations so that the workplace can maximize employees productivity and enterprise performance. However, usually the integration of new components in smart environments is not straightforward. In this article we propose the use of a semantic vocabulary to define this automation, and an architecture consisting of a web task automation server and mobile task automation components that enable contextual services. One the one hand, the architecture exhibits flexibility to interconnect internet services and devices. On the other side, the use of semantic technologies provides semantic interoperability and expressivity for the automation definition.	4.0
A numerical model has been developed for a system consisting of a liquid slug and a vapour plug oscillating in a tube closed at one end, and connected to a reservoir at a constant pressure at the other end, which represents the most basic configuration of a Pulsating Heat Pipe (PHP). The thermally driven self-sustained oscillations of the system result from evaporation and condensation phenomena occurring at two zones of the tube (separated by an adiabatic section), one being cooled and the other being heated, simultaneously. The modelling principles of this system had been posed in previous works. In this work, the equation describing the liquid film evaporation has been substantially improved in the light of recent experimental results: both, the thickening of the film and the shortening of its length due to the evaporation at the triple line are taken into account. Furthermore, the transient heat conduction equation is solved in both the tube and the liquid film in order to Calculate the temperature of the evaporator, which is a key parameter of the model. Moreover, an experimental bench is presented to measure the pressure variations inside an oscillating liquid slug. The results show that the classical correlations of fluid mechanics are relevant to model the oscillation of this system. Finally, a parametric study is carried out to understand the influence of the thermal properties of both the liquid and the tube on the start-up of the system. The thermal effusivity of both these materials is found to be an important criterion to indicate the conditions under which oscillations can commence and relain self-sustained.

This paper puts forward a novel design method of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The most significant advantage of this method is that the output power of PMSG can be prominently improved without increasing any material costs. The main difference from the traditional design scheme is that the volume of permanent magnet (PM) remains unchanged during the entire design procedure. And the maximum output power scheme is found out just by optimizing the PM's shapes with the change of mechanical pole-arc coefficient. In other words, this method aims to obtain the maximum PM utilization design scheme that can produce more effective magnet field so that it can generate the larger output power. The dimension parameters of PMs with different shapes are calculated by the equivalent analytic geometry method. To verify its availability, this novel method is performed on four common types of PMSGs with different rotor structures, and their satisfactory performance results are obtained. The comparison with the traditional machine design scheme is also presented to illustrate the innovation and priority. The finite element analysis method based on Ansoft/Maxwell is applied for the electromagnetic models' building and simulation.	3.3
Web news articles are generated in continuous, time-varying, and rapid modes. This environment causes an explosion of information which needs to be stored, processed and analyzed. Conventional machine learning algorithms that are applied in the web news mining work in an offline environment cannot efficiently handle data streams. In this paper, we propose an evolving web news mining framework based on the recently published Evolving Type-2 Classifier (eT2Class). The eT2Class adopts an open structure that can be used in non stationary environments and works on a single pass learning mode that is applicable for online real-time applications. The effectiveness of our evolving web news mining techniques is numerically validated and compared against state-of-the-art algorithms. The efficacy of our methodology has been numerically validated with real local Australian news articles, namely the Age, spanning from 26/2/2016 to 13/3/2016 and has been compared with 6 state of the art algorithms. Our algorithm outperforms other consolidated algorithms and achieves a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy with almost 10% improvement in term of complexity.

There are common aspects and mechanisms between different types of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs), and autoimmune encephalitis (AE) as well as paraneoplastic inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system. To our present knowledge, depending on the disease, T and B cells as well as antibodies contribute to various aspects of the pathogenesis. Possibly the events leading to the breaking of tolerance between the different diseases are of great similarity and so far, only partially understood. Beside endogenous factors (genetics, genomics, epigenetics, malignancy) also exogenous factors (vitamin D, sun light exposure, smoking, gut microbiome, viral infections) contribute to susceptibility in such diseases. What differs between these disorders are the target molecules of the immune attack. For T cells, these target molecules are presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as MHC-bound ligands. B cells have an important role by amplifying the immune response of T cells by capturing antigen with their surface immunoglobulin and presenting it to T cells. Antibodies secreted by plasma cells that have differentiated from B cells are highly structure specific and can have important effector functions leading to functional impairment or/and lesion evolvement. In MS, the target molecules are mainly myelin-and neuron/axon-derived proteins; in NMOSD, mainly aquaporin-4 expressed on astrocytes; and in AE, various proteins that are expressed by neurons and axons.	6.4
Hatred of terrorists is an obstacle to the implementation of effective counterterrorism policies-it invites indiscriminate retaliation, whereas many of the greatest successes in counterterrorism have come from understanding terrorists' personal and political motivations. Drawing from psychological research, traditional prejudice reduction strategies are generally not well suited to the task of reducing hatred of terrorists. Instead, in 2 studies, we explored education's potential ability to reduce extreme negative attitudes toward terrorists. Study 1 compared students in a college course on terrorism (treatment) with wait-listed students, measuring prosocial attitudes toward a hypothetical terrorist. Initially, all students reported extremely negative attitudes; however, at the end of the semester, treatment students' attitudes were significantly improved. Study 2 replicated the effect within a sample of treatment and control classes drawn from universities across the United States. The present work was part of an ongoing research project, focusing on foreign policy and the perceived threat of terrorism; thus classes did not explicitly aim to reduce prejudice, making the effect of treatment somewhat surprising. One possibility is that learning about terrorists crowds out the initial pejorative associations-that is, the label terrorism may ultimately call more information to mind, diluting its initial negative associative links. Alternatively, students may learn to challenge how the label terrorist is being applied. In either case, learning about terrorism can decrease the extreme negative reactions it evokes, which is desirable if one wishes to implement effective counterterrorism policies.	2.0
Nutrition plays an important role in human metabolism and health. However, it is unclear in how far self-reported nutrition intake reflects de facto differences in body metabolite composition. To investigate this question on an epidemiological scale we conducted a metabolomics study analyzing the association of self-reported nutrition habits with 363 metabolites quantified in blood serum of 284 male participants of the KORA population study, aged between 55 and 79 years. Using data from an 18-item food frequency questionnaire, the consumption of 18 different food groups as well as four derived nutrition indices summarizing these food groups by their nutrient content were analyzed for association with the measured metabolites. The self-reported nutrition intake index polyunsaturated fatty acids associates with a decrease in saturation of the fatty acid chains of glycero-phosphatidylcholines analyzed in serum samples. Using a principal component analysis dietary patterns highly associating with serum metabolite concentrations could be identified. The first principal component, which was interpreted as a healthy nutrition lifestyle, associates with a decrease in the degree of saturation of the fatty acid moieties of different glycero-phosphatidylcholines. In summary, this analysis shows that on a population level metabolomics provides the possibility to link self-reported nutrition habits to changes in human metabolic profiles and that the associating metabolites reflect the self-reported nutritional intake. Moreover, we could show that the strength of association increases when composed nutrition indices are used. Metabolomics may, thus, facilitate evaluating questionnaires and improving future questionnaire-based epidemiological studies on human health.	6.2
Objective: This pilot project was designed to develop procedures for and test the feasibility of implementing Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) in a group home environment, with a goal of maximizing treatment efficacy by augmenting social engagement in group CET sessions with ongoing social interaction. Methods: Six participants who met criteria including chronic schizophrenia were recruited in a group home with 30 residents. After two months of CET, pre- and posttest measures, including cognitive tests, were administered and qualitative interviews were conducted periodically. Interaction was observed in the house and staff members were interviewed in a focus group. Results: Five of the initial six participants completed the intervention-which continued for a total of 45 weeks-engaging in weekly group CET sessions and computer exercises outside of the formal sessions. All participants liked the computer exercises, and all but one participated in and reported enjoying the group exercises. Observations and staff comments indicated increased social interaction and sustained impact for some residents. Some aspects of cognitive functioning improved for some participants during the initial two months. Conclusions: CET now needs to be tested more formally to determine if it can be delivered successfully in other group homes with a manualized procedure. The idea should be tested that feedback effects due to the sustained social contact may enhance the effectiveness of CET in group homes and lead to larger, sustained gains in community functioning. Clinicians who provide cognitive interventions should focus attention on the social context in which treatment is delivered and consider providing treatment to patient groups whose daily, ongoing social interaction can enhance its effects.

Though many of people's impressions about each other stem from qualities that are obvious or apparent, social perceptions also rely on a variety of subtle cues that guide judgment and behavior. For example, emerging work has increasingly elucidated the conditions and means by which individuals' accuracy in judging others' sexual orientation is better than chance. We discuss these here, focusing on four domains from which people draw cues to accurately perceive sexual orientation: how people adorn themselves (adornment), how they move (actions), how they sound (acoustics), and how they look (appearance). Moreover, we describe how certain factors, such as one's own sexual orientation, can constrain or facilitate this accuracy and describe the various negative social and occupational consequences that may result from cues that someone is gay or straight.	2.0
Dendritic cells (DCs) recognize foreign structures of different pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, via a variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on their cell surface and thereby activate and regulate immunity. The major function of DCs is the induction of adaptive immunity in the lymph nodes by presenting antigens via MHC I and MHC II molecules to naive T lymphocytes. Therefore, DCs have to migrate from the periphery to the lymph nodes after the recognition of pathogens at the sites of infection. For in vitro experiments or DC vaccination strategies, monocyte-derived DCs are routinely used. These cells show similarities in physiology, morphology, and function to conventional myeloid dendritic cells. They are generated by interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation of monocytes isolated from healthy donors. Here, we demonstrate how monocytes are isolated and stimulated from anti-coagulated human blood after peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) enrichment by density gradient centrifugation. Human monocytes are differentiated into immature DCs and are ready for experimental procedures in a non-clinical setting after 5 days of incubation.	6.3
Photometric redshifts (photo-z) are fundamental in galaxy surveys to address different topics, from gravitational lensing and dark matter distribution to galaxy evolution. The Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS), i. e. the European Southern Observatory (ESO) public survey on the VLT Survey Telescope (VST), provides the unprecedented opportunity to exploit a large galaxy data set with an exceptional image quality and depth in the optical wavebands. Using a KiDS subset of about 25000 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, we have derived photo-z using (i) three different empirical methods based on supervised machine learning; (ii) the Bayesian photometric redshift model (or BPZ); and (iii) a classical spectral energy distribution (SED) template fitting procedure (LE PHARE). We confirm that, in the regions of the photometric parameter space properly sampled by the spectroscopic templates, machine learning methods provide better redshift estimates, with a lower scatter and a smaller fraction of outliers. SED fitting techniques, however, provide useful information on the galaxy spectral type, which can be effectively used to constrain systematic errors and to better characterize potential catastrophic outliers. Such classification is then used to specialize the training of regression machine learning models, by demonstrating that a hybrid approach, involving SED fitting and machine learning in a single collaborative framework, can be effectively used to improve the accuracy of photo-z estimates.	0.1
In novel forms of the Social Internet of Things, any mobile user within communication range may help routing messages for another user in the network. The resulting message delivery rate depends both on the users' mobility patterns and the message load in the network. This new type of configuration, however, poses new challenges to security, amongst them, assessing the effect that a group of colluding malicious participants can have on the global message delivery rate in such a network is far from trivial. In this work, after modeling such a question as an optimization problem, we are able to find quite interesting results by coupling a network simulator with an evolutionary algorithm. The chosen algorithm is specifically designed to solve problems whose solutions can be decomposed into parts sharing the same structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two medium-sized Delay-Tolerant Networks, realistically simulated in the urban contexts of two cities with very different route topology: Venice and San Francisco. In all experiments, our methodology produces attack patterns that greatly lower network performance with respect to previous studies on the subject, as the evolutionary core is able to exploit the specific weaknesses of each target configuration.

We conduct 2-D simulations of device structures typical of electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging and solar cell structures for p-type CdTe absorber layers with charged grain boundaries. A large signal enhancement is found near depleted (positively charged) grain boundaries for EBIC simulation, but in contrast with previous claims, solar cell performance drops. In contrast, little EBIC contrast is seen, but the cell performance improves when accumulated (negatively charged) grain boundaries are introduced. We explore the impact of doping level, lifetimes, and grain boundary charge to provide insight for design of improved thin film solar cells.	3.0
Novel approaches for studying the brain and relating its activities to mental phenomena have come into use during the past decade (Bargmann, 2015). These include both new laboratory methods - involving, among others, generation of isolated cells which retain neuronal characteristics in vivo; the selective stimulation of neurons by light in vivo; and direct electrical stimulation of specific brain regions to restore a system's balance of excitation and inhibition - and a new organizing principle, connectomics, which recognizes that networks, and not simply a key nucleus or region, underlie most brain functions and malfunctions. Its application has already improved our comprehension of how the brain normally functions and our ability to help patients with such poorly treated neurologic and psychiatric diseases as Alzheimer's disease.

The analysis of pottery from the settlement Uttumer Escher is part of a DFG project which studies all riverside find complexes of the Roman Iron Age on the lower Weser and the lower Ems rivers in order to identify their possible function as wharves/piers. The pottery from Uttumer Escher stands out for their unusually high proportion of organically tempered ceramic ware reflecting a pottery variant, which is already known from other contemporary settlements astride the Ems. Typological comparisons and pottery analyses were conducted for a closer examination of this chronologically restricted and regional pottery tradition. They confirmed the already assumed peculiar manufacturing engineering. There is also frequent evidence for this pottery in the Dutch settlement area, although with different dating. A critical review of the basis of dating on the individual sites in both countries reveals that it could well be a contemporary phenomenon rendered possible by the necessity to add special temper to limey clay.	3.2

Rho family GTPases are signaling molecules that orchestrate cytoskeletal dynamics in a variety of cellular processes. Because they effect localized changes to the cytoskeleton only in their active (GTP-bound) conformation, the ability to monitor the active state of Rho GTPases in space and time is critical for understanding their function. Here, we summarize popular tools used for live imaging of active Rho GTPases, outlining advantages and drawbacks of these approaches. Additionally, we highlight key features of the Xenopus laevis embryo that make it well-suited for epithelial cell biology and discuss how application of Rho activity reporters in the Xenopus laevis embryo led to the discovery of a novel phenomenon, junctional Rho flares.	6.1
Alzheimer's disease is a representative age-related neurodegenerative disease that could result in loss of memory and cognitive deficiency. However, the precise onset time of Alzheimer's disease affecting neuronal circuits and the mechanisms underlying the changes are not clearly known. To address the neuroanatomical changes during the early pathologic developing process, we acquired the neuronal morphological characterization of AD in APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice using the Micro-Optical Sectioning Tomography system. We reconstructed the neurons in 3D datasets with a resolution of 0.32 x 032 x 1 gm and used the Sholl method to analyze the anatomical characterization of the dendritic branches. The results showed that, similar to the progressive change in amyloid plaques, the number of dendritic branches were significantly decreased in 9-month-old mice. In addition, a distinct reduction of dendritic complexity occurred in third and fourth-order dendritic branches of 9-month-old mice, while no significant changes were identified in these parameters in 6-month-old mice. At the branch-level, the density distribution of dendritic arbors in the radial direction decreased in the range of 40-90 gm from the neuron soma in 6-month-old mice. These changes in the dendritic complexity suggest that these reductions contribute to the progressive cognitive impairment seen in APP/PS1 mice. This work may yield insights into the early changes in dendritic abnormality and its relevance to dysfunctional mechanisms of learning, memory and emotion in Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: To provide selectable microRNA for intervening diabetes mellitus diseases, NOD mice's expression of microRNA in pancreas tissues and blood under the exendin-4 intervention of was observed and the difference of microRNA target gene was screened. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty clean NOD mice were randomly divided into four groups (in each group, n = 10): One is blank control group D which is intervened with normal saline, and the other three groups were divided into low-dose group A, middle-dose group B, and high-dose group C according to the different exendin- 4 dosage 2, 4, and 8 mu g/kg.d. After the 8-week intervention, these four groups were killed, and the pancreatic tissue and blood were left to prepare specimens for morphology and molecular biology analysis. The specimen with differential expression microRNA in pancreas tissue and blood should be screened out after detected with the locked nucleic acid array system (LNATM) microRNA expression profile chip. The primers should be designed, and the ABI7500 real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR should be applied to amplify, analyze, and verify according to the screen results of the microRNA chip in order to screen out the significant differentially expressed microRNA. RESULTS: Histological detection showed that the pancreas of the mice in control group D was fibrosis gradually and the islet frame was relatively disordered and significantly atrophied. Groups A, B, and C have no islet hypertrophy or atrophy and the degree of fibrosis of the pancreas has reduced. According to the gene chip detection, there are four significantly differently expressed microRNAs in pancreas tissue and blood among the group A, B, and C, among which miR-19a, miR-19b, and miR-22 were down-regulated expressed while the miRNA-1 was upregulated expressed. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the target genes of 4 differentially regulated microRNA genes were related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and angiogenesis. The expression of microRNA in pancreatic tissue and blood of NOD rats was highly consistent. CONCLUSIONS: MicroRNA expression file of pancreatic tissue and blood can be changed during the intervention of the NOD rat model with exendin-4. MicroRNA that indicates the differential expression may take part in the recovering process of the NOD pancreatic trauma. At the same time, the administration of exendin- 4 can protect NOD mice, reduce its pancreatic tissue fibrosis, and regulate molecular markers of pancreatic cells in size and pancreatic mast cells. This may be one of the main mechanisms of pancreatic injury in diabetes prevention.	6.0
Considerable evidence suggests that adolescent exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol (THC), the psychoactive component in marijuana, increases the risk of developing schizophrenia-related symptoms in early adulthood. In the present study, we used a combination of behavioral and molecular analyses with in vivo neuronal electrophysiology to compare the long-termeffects of adolescent versus adulthood THC exposure in rats. We report that adolescent, but not adult, THC exposure induces long-term neuropsychiatric-like phenotypes similar to those observed in clinical populations. Thus, adolescent THC exposure induced behavioral abnormalities resembling positive and negative schizophrenia-related endophenotypes and a state of neuronal hyperactivity in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. Furthermore, we observed profound alterations in several prefrontal cortical molecular pathways consistent with sub-cortical DAergic dysregulation. Our findings demonstrate a profound dissociation in relative risk profiles for adolescent versus adulthood exposure to THC in terms of neuronal, behavioral, and molecular markers resembling neuropsychiatric pathology.	2.1
Particulate matter (PM) pollution from China is transported eastward to Korea and Japan and has been suggested to influence surface air quality on the West Coast of the United States. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to recent trends in Chinese emissions and transport. We reconciled different passive remote sensing points of view and found that while aerosol optical thickness (AOT) as an indicator of particulate pollution has increased from the start of the observation period (2000) to 2006-2007 from the main Chinese coastal outflow regions, since then there has been a 10-20% decrease in AOT (with respect to 2007). Reductions were observed in spring, summer, and fall seasons. No improvement in exported PM pollution is found for the winter season. Plain Language Summary Particulate matter pollution from China is transported eastward to Korea and Japan and has been suggested to influence surface air quality on the West Coast of the United States. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to recent trends in Chinese emissions and transport. We reconciled different passive remote sensing points of view and found that while aerosol optcial thickness (AOT) as an indicator of particulate pollution has increased to 2006-2007 in the main exit regions of China's coast, since then there has been a 10-20% decrease in AOT (with respect to 2007). Reductions were observed in spring, summer, and fall seasons. No improvement in exported particulate matter pollution is found for the winter season.	4.2
Psychiatry research has long experienced a stagnation stemming from a lack of understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of phenomenologically defined mental disorders. Recently, the application of computational neuroscience to psychiatry research has shown great promise in establishing a link between phenomenological and pathophysiological aspects of mental disorders, thereby recasting current nosology in more biologically meaningful dimensions. In this review, we highlight recent investigations into computational neuroscience that have undertaken either theory- or data-driven approaches to quantitatively delineate the mechanisms of mental disorders. The theory-driven approach, including reinforcement learning models, plays an integrative role in this process by enabling correspondence between behavior and disorder-specific alterations at multiple levels of brain organization, ranging from molecules to cells to circuits. Previous studies have explicated a plethora of defining symptoms of mental disorders, including anhedonia, inattention, and poor executive function. The data-driven approach, on the other hand, is an emerging field in computational neuroscience seeking to identify disorder-specific features among high-dimensional big data. Remarkably, various machine-learning techniques have been applied to neuroimaging data, and the extracted disorder-specific features have been used for automatic case-control classification. For many disorders, the reported accuracies have reached 90% or more. However, we note that rigorous tests on independent cohorts are critically required to translate this research into clinical applications. Finally, we discuss the utility of the disorder-specific features found by the data-driven approach to psychiatric therapies, including neurofeedback. Such developments will allow simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders using neuroimaging, thereby establishing theranostics' for the first time in clinical psychiatry.	0.1
Arctic river icings are surface ice accumulations that can be >10km(2) in area and >10m thick. They commonly impact the hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology of Arctic river environments. Previous examination of icing dynamics in Arctic Alaska found no substantial changes in extent through 2005. However, here we use daily time series of satellite imagery for 2000-2015 to demonstrate that the temporal persistence and minimum summertime extent of large icings in part of Arctic Alaska and Canada have declined rapidly. We identified 122 large ephemeral icings, and 70 are disappearing significantly earlier in the summer, with a mean trend of -1.60.9day(-1) for fully ephemeral features. Additionally, 14 of 25 icings that usually persist through the summer have significantly smaller minimum extents (-2.61.6%yr(-1)). These declines are remarkably rapid and suggest that Arctic hydroclimatic systems generating icings, and their associated ecosystems, are changing rapidly. Plain Language Summary Liquid water emerging from groundwater and flowing through Arctic rivers during the winter often freezes into large ice features, which are called river icings. These icings, which are found in nearly all parts of the Arctic, create wide, gravelly river channels that can be important habitat for animals. When icings melt during the summer, they help keep rivers flowing when other water sources are limited. Up until now, no study has systematically looked at whether these features are changing in response to warming temperatures. We use daily satellite imagery available over northern Alaska from 2000 to 2015 in order to test whether icings are becoming smaller or disappearing earlier in the summer. Of 147 features examined, we found that 84 are either becoming smaller (for those that persist throughout the summer) or are disappearing earlier (for those that fully melt each summer). None are becoming larger or disappearing later. These changes may be directly related to warming temperatures, but they may also be happening because climate change is altering how rivers and groundwater interact. If these trends continue, we may see changes in the form of many Arctic rivers and impacts on the habitat of animals like fish and caribou.	4.2
This paper presents a 3-D statistical simulation study of an n-channel Si step-FinFET due to work-function variability depending on grain orientation of metal gate. The statistical fluctuation induced by metal gate granularity on threshold-voltage (sigma V-T), ON current (sigma I-ON), and OFF current (sigma I-OFF) are estimated for a wide range of channel length and effective fin width for varying average grain size using Technology Computer Aided Design simulator. We investigated the effect of grain on magnitude of variability and also on shapes of various electrical parameters of distribution. The results indicate that sigma V-T decreases for increase in each dimension of the device. The value of sigma(ION), and sigma(IOFF) reduces as channel length increases. However, sigma(ION) and sigma(IOFF) increase as fin width increases. The distribution of electrical parameters is near to normal for small grain size and becomes bimodal at large grain size. The proposed structure shows excellent behavior in terms of threshold-voltage (V-T), subthreshold swing, and current ratio (I-ON/I-OFF) compared with conventional FinFET at high temperature. It is found that the hot carrier effect reduces with increased effective channel width.	3.0
The Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Besides, they are some of the most dependent on imported petroleum products in the world, the use of renewable energy (RE) can help minimize the economic risk associated with the price volatility of fossil fuels. The region is increasingly adopting renewable energy (RE) targets and policies. Successful examples of RE deployment in the Pacific SIDS exist; however, many barriers persist and prevent the use of the region's RE resources in a larger scale. Challenges for RE deployment in islands can be grouped in six categories: i) lack of RE data, ii) need for policy and regulatory frameworks, iii) scarcity of financial opportunities, iv) lack of human resources, v) costly infrastructure, and vi) socio-cultural impediments. Based on a survey conducted among main stakeholders in the region, within the framework of the Pacific Region Capacity Building Initiative of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) carried out in cooperation with the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), this paper identifies the specific characteristics of these challenges in the context of the Pacific SIDS, provide a qualitative assessment and identifies recommendations to overcome these challenges.

Whereas the question of verbal versus nonverbal primacy has gained intensive interest, considerably less attention has been devoted to parental response to children's verbal/nonverbal incongruence. This study comprehensively analyzed parental responses to children's incongruence during mutual interactions. Parent-child interactions (n = 160) in structured joint game sequences were filmed in their homes and analyzed using a mixed multivariate design. Unexpectedly, parents related almost equally to verbal and nonverbal channels. The analysis of a wide range of social and situational contexts, including child's sex, parent's sex, SES, and task difficulty, highlighted their significant effects and delineated the contexts that activated verbal primacy, nonverbal primacy, and incongruent responses. This study provides a composite theoretical framework for the relative dominance of verbal versus nonverbal communication.	2.3
Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show cognitive and behavioral disorders, which they and their caregivers have difficulties to cope with in daily life. Psychological symptoms seem to be increased by impaired emotion processing in patients, this ability being linked to social cognition and thus essential to maintain good interpersonal relationships. Non-verbal emotion processing is a genuine way to communicate, especially so for patients whose language may be rapidly impaired. Many studies focus on emotion identification in AD patients, mostly by means of facial expressions rather than emotional prosody; even fewer consider emotional prosody production, despite its playing a key role in interpersonal exchanges. The literature on this subject is scarce with contradictory results. The present study compares the performances of 14 AD patients (88.4 +/- 4.9 yrs; MMSE: 19.9 +/- 2.7) to those of 14 control subjects (87.5 +/- 5.1 yrs; MMSE: 28.1 +/- 1.4) in tasks of emotion identification through faces and voices (non linguistic vocal emotion or emotional prosody) and in a task of emotional prosody production (12 sentences were to be pronounced in a neutral, positive, or negative tone, after a context was read). The Alzheimer's disease patients showed weaker performances than control subjects in all emotional recognition tasks and particularly when identifying emotional prosody. A negative relation between the identification scores and the NPI (professional caregivers) scores was found which underlines their link to psychological and behavioral disorders. The production of emotional prosody seems relatively preserved in a mild to moderate stage of the disease: we found subtle differences regarding acoustic parameters but in a qualitative way judges established that the patients' productions were as good as those of control subjects. These results suggest interesting new directions for improving patients' care.	2.3
The environmental regulation of a coal mine in the greater Sydney area has failed to recognise the importance of and protect a high conservation-value river located in a World Heritage listed area. This study measured the water quality and ecological health (using macroinvertebrates) of the Wollangambe River and its tributaries near the point of the waste water discharge of a coal mine and assessed the longitudinal impact for 22 km downstream. The investigation revealed two important aspects. The first is the significant impact of the waste water discharge when compared to the otherwise near-pristine condition of the high conservation-value river system. The second is the spatial extent of the pollution from the mine that extends at least 22 km downstream from the outflow of coal mine wastes. The resulting water pollution is causing major impairment of the aquatic ecosystem, with reduced abundance, taxonomic richness and loss of pollution-sensitive macroin-vertebrate groups. Water pollution from the mine includes thermal pollution, increased salinity and increased concentrations of zinc and nickel. The mine's waste discharge also strongly modified the river's ionic composition. The study also highlights the failure of the regulatory and governance systems that enable the mine to operate in a manner that causes major environmental impacts.	4.4
The recent rise of virtual and augmented reality applications, ambient intelligence, as well as video games have encouraged the proliferation of gestural input devices such as the Razer Hydra, Leap Motion Controller, and Kinect 3D. Because these devices do not relay data in a standard format, application developers are forced to use a different Application Programming Interface (API) for each device. The main objective of this research was to define and implement LaGeR (Language for Gesture Representation), a language for the representation and interpretation of two and three dimensional device-agnostic gestures. Through LaGeR, developers can define gestures that will then be processed regardless of the device and the APIs involved. To ease the use of LaGeR, a LaGeR Workbench was developed as a set of tools and software libraries to convert gestures into LaGeR strings, recognize those strings as gestures, visualize the originating gestures in 3D, and communicate those detections to subscribing programs. In addition, LaGeR's effectiveness was validated through experiments in which LaGeR Workbench was used to give users control of representative functionality of the Google Chrome web browser by using two-hand gestures with a Razer Hydra device. LaGeR was found to be simple yet expressive enough to represent gestures and develop gesture-based device-agnostic applications.	4.0
The use of ethnic imagery in visual identities of brands, such as those used by professional sports franchises, has long been a contentious issue in American society. This research investigates the oft-voiced argument that ethnic brand imagery perpetuates negative stereotypes (a claim that has been subject to very little empirical scrutiny) and identifies conditions under which encountering such brand imagery strengthens both positive and negative implicit stereotypes. Within the context of American Indian brand imagery, two laboratory experiments (Studies 1 and 2) and a quasi experimental field study (Study 3) revealed that the effects of ethnic brand imagery on stereotypes depend on the viewer's political identity. Exposure to ethnic brand imagery strengthened implicit stereotypes only among more liberal individuals, consistent with the idea that liberals tend to hold more malleable views. These findings demonstrate measurable negative effects of ethnic brand imagery on implicit stereotypes and support the view that the use of such imagery can carry detrimental societal consequences.

This paper provides a review of key concepts for concurrent design for different machine types that are suitable for self-sensing at both zero to low speed and high speed operation. The impact of modifying the machine design to be suitable for self-sensing on power conversion properties (Average, cogging and ripple torque) is presented for several classical and advanced machine types. General recommendations to yield both self-sensing performance and good power conversion properties are provided for induction machines, surface permanent magnet machines, flux-intensifying interior permanent magnet machines, and variable flux machines with variable magnetization state and variable leakage flux.	3.3
With the development of trusted network, the research of trusted evaluation mechanism of user behavior is a hotpot in the network security. In order to solve the problems of subjectivity, limitations and static in traditional trusted network user behavior evaluation models, we have to find a real-time and dynamic evaluation method for user behavior. In this paper, the authors construct a real-time evaluation mechanism based on double evidence classification of user behavior (DEC-UB). The evaluation mechanism includes the process classification and characteristic classification of user behavior evidence, which makes the user behavior evidence of any time can be directly involved in the trust evaluation, and the evaluation result is more comprehensive and accurate. Simulation experiments have evaluated the three kinds of user behaviors based on the DEC-UB, and compared them with the other two kinds of trust evaluation methods of user behavior, the results show that the proposed methods can evaluate the user's behavior comprehensively, accurately and dynamically in complex network environments, and the results are more realistic.	0.2
Performance of compacted clay liners commonly used as landfill barrier systems can be subject to decline in terms of hydraulic conductivity if left exposed to atmospheric conditions for an extended period of time prior to placement of overlaying layers. The resulting desiccation cracking can lead to increased hydraulic conductivity. Desiccation crack intensity was studied for three clayey soils commonly used for construction of landfill barrier system in a relatively large scale test setup exposed to real time atmospheric conditions over a complete annual cycle. A white separator geotextile cover was presumed to be capable of reducing the intensity of desiccation cracking through absorbing and maintaining higher amounts of moisture and reducing the temperature of the soil surface in comparison to a directly exposed soil surface. Desiccation cracking was monitored using a digital imaging technique for three compacted clay liners in two sets, one open to air and the second covered with the white geotextile. Crack intensity factor approached a relatively stable phase after certain cycles corresponding to atmospheric dry wet cycles. The results indicated that the white separator geotextile was capable of reducing the crack intensity factor by 37.4-45.9% throughout the experiment including the cyclic phase of desiccation cracking. During the stable phase, the maximum reduction in crack intensity factor of 90.4% as a result of applying geotextile cover was observed for the soil with the lowest plastic index and clay content and therefore the lowest magnitude of crack intensity factor. The other two soils with similar clay content but different plastic index showed 23.6% and 52.2% reductions in crack intensity factor after cyclic phase when covered with geotextile.

Cockroach (CR) allergies caused by the American cockroach hyave been recognized to be repsonsible for IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity worldwide. Per a 10 is one of the recognized main allergens of the American CR. In a previous study, we examined another American CR allergen, Per a 9 in patients with CR allergies and examined epitope sequences in this allergen. In the present study, we aimed to examine epitope sequences in the Per a 10 allergen. for this purpose, the Per a 10 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) systems. Our results revealed that 9 out of 16 (56.3%) sera from patients with American CR allergies reacted to Per a10, as assessed by ELISA, confirming that Per a 10 is a major allergen of the American CR. Our results also revealed that the expression of CD63 and CCR3 on passively sensitized basophils (obtained sera of patients with American CR allergies) was increased by approximately 2.3-fold, indicating that recombinant Per a 10 is functionally active. In addition, 3 immunoinformatics tools, namely the DNAStar Protean system, the Bioinformatics Predicted Antigenic Peptides (BPAP) system and the BepiPred 1.0 server were used to predict the peptides and the results revealed 8 peptides (2-12, 55-67, 98-120, 125-133, 149-160, 170-182, 201-208 and 223-227) as potential B cell epitopes of the Per a 10 allergen. Moreover, Per a 10 was predicted to have 3 T cell epitope sequences, namely 83-92, 139-147 and 162-170. The findings of our study on the CR allergen may prove to be useful in the development of peptide-based vaccine for the prevention and/or treatment of CR allergies.	5.1
Introduction: Neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) YKL-40 - an indicator of microglial activation - has recently been identified by proteomic studies as a candidate biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Areas covered: We review the impact of CSF YKL-40 as a pathophysiological biomarker for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. CSF YKL-40 concentrations have been shown to predict progression from prodromal mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. Moreover, a positive association between CSF YKL-40 and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration - particularly total tau protein - has been reported during the asymptomatic preclinical stage of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Albeit preliminary, current data do not support an association between APOE-epsilon 4 status and CSF YKL-40 concentrations. When interpreting the diagnostic/prognostic significance of CSF YKL-40 concentrations in neurodegenerative diseases, potential confounders - including age, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, diagnostic criteria for selecting cases/controls - need to be considered.Expert opinion/commentary: CSF YKL-40 represents a pathophysiological biomarker reflecting immune/inflammatory mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, associated with tau protein pathology. Besides being associated with tau pathology, CSF YKL-40 adds to the growing array of biomarkers reflecting distinct molecular brain mechanisms potentially useful for stratifying individuals for biomarker-guided, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies emerging from precision medicine.	5.2
This paper presents a high-speed drive to be used for electrically-assisted turbo charging in an internal combustion engine. The electrification of the turbo-charger system can enhance the performance and reduce the dynamic drawbacks that affect conventional solutions i.e. turbo-lag. However, the design of the electric drive presents some challenges, especially related to the thermally aggressive environment and the high rotational speed. Therefore, a system level design approach needs to be adopted, where all the different sub-systems of the drive are addressed simultaneously. Thus, this paper includes considerations for the thermal and electromagnetic machine design. Furthermore, a voltage source inverter featuring wide-bandgap SiC power devices is described, and a sensorless rotor position detection and digital control is used to drive the machine. Finally, the test setup and preliminary experimental results are presented.	3.3
Informal groups form hierarchies and allocate social status in order to coordinate action and make collective decisions. Although researchers have identified characteristics of people who tend to get status, the extent to which these characteristics are context-dependent is unclear. In two studies, participants from the United States (N = 157) and Germany (N = 95) engaged in affiliative or competitive group interactions. We investigated whether the nature of the group's task moderated the relationship between status attainment and personality. As in previous research, we found that extraversion predicted status in both competitive and affiliative contexts. In contrast, agreeableness was only associated with status in affiliative contexts. These findings underscore the importance of examining the relationship between personality and social status in context.	2.2
It is widely recognized that the public-key cryptosystems are playing tremendously an important role for providing the security services. In majority of the cryptosystems the crucial arithmetic operation is modular exponentiation. It is composed of a series of modular multiplications. Hence, the performance of any cryptosystem is strongly depends on the efficient implementation of these operations. This paper presents the Bit Forwarding 3-bits(BFW3) technique for efficient implementation of modular exponentiation. The modular multiplication involved in BFW3 is evaluated with the help of Montgomery method. These techniques improves the performance by reducing the frequency of modular multiplications. Results shows that the BFW3 technique is able to reduce the frequency of multiplications by 18.20% for 1024-bit exponent. This reduction resulted in increased throughput of 18.11% in comparison with MME42_C2 at the cost of 1.09% extra area. The power consumption reduced by 8.53% thereby saving the energy up to 10.10%.	0.3
Online language learning and teaching in multimodal contexts has been identified as one of the key research areas in computer-aided learning (CALL) (Lamy, 2013; White, 2014).(1) This paper aims to explore meaning-making in online language learner interactions via desktop videoconferencing (DVC) and in doing so illustrate multimodal transcription and analysis as well as the application of theoretical frameworks from other fields. Recordings of learner DVC interactions and interviews are qualitatively analysed within a case study methodology. The analysis focuses on how semiotic resources available in DVC are used for meaning-making, drawing on semiotics, interactional sociolinguistics, nonverbal communication, multimodal interaction analysis and conversation analysis. The findings demonstrate the use of contextualization cues, five codes of the body, paralinguistic elements for emotional expression, gestures and overlapping speech in meaning-making. The paper concludes with recommendations for teachers and researchers using and investigating language learning and teaching in multimodal contexts.	2.3
The severe global climate changes result in consecutive torrential rains in rainy season, and causes water loss and soil erosion. For an effective water and soil conservation, geotextiles are commonly used in geotechnical engineering. Geotextiles should able to isolate soil, filter water, and reinforce the soil; therefore, the material for geotextiles should be acid-resistant and alkali-resistant, such as polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PET). This study uses PP fibers as the skin and PET plied yarns as the core to form PP/PET composite tubular knits on a cord knitting machine. The PET plied yarn is fed with a specified tensile strength, and only the tooth number of the drive gear varies. Mechanical property test results show that a drive gear of 30 teeth increases the tensile strength of the resulting tubular knits; however, with a drive gear of 35 teeth, the tensile strength decreases. An optimal core coverage occurs with a drive gear of 30 teeth.	4.1
Visual animal biometrics is an emerging research discipline in computer vision, pattern recognition and cognitive science. It is a promising research field that encourages new development of quantified algorithms and methodologies for representing, detection of visible features, phenotypic appearances of species, individuals and recognition of morphological and animal biometric characteristics. Furthermore, it also assists the study of animal trajectory and behaviours analysis of species. Currently, real-world applications of visual animal biometric systems are gaining more proliferation due to a variety of applications and use, enhancement of quantity and quality of the collection of extensive ecological data and processing. However, to advance visual animal biometrics will require integration of methodologies among the scientific disciplines involved. Such valuable efforts will be worthwhile due to the enormous perspective of this approach rests with the formal abstraction of phenomics, to build well-developed interfaces between different organisational levels of life. This study provides a comprehensive survey of visual animal biometric systems and recognition approaches for various species and individual animal based on their morphological image pattern and biometric characteristics. This comprehensive review paper encourages the multidisciplinary researchers, scientists, biologists and different research communities to design the better platforms for the development of efficient algorithms and learning models to solve the massive data processing, classification and identification of different species related problems.	0.0
The diurnal light cycle has a crucial influence on all life on earth. Unfortunately, modern society has modified this life- governing cycle by stressing maximum production and by giving insufficient attention to the ecological balance and homeostasis of the human metabolism. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of exposure or lack of exposure to natural light in a rest/ activity rhythm on cortisol and melatonin levels, as well as on psychological variables in humans under natural conditions. This is a cross- sectional study. The subjects were allocated split into two groups according to their workspace ( 10 employees in the with window'' group and 10 in the without window'' group). All participants were women and wore anactigraph ( Actiwatch 2, Philips Respironics), which measures activity and ambient light exposure, for seven days. Concentrations of melatonin and cortisol were measured from the saliva samples. Participants were instructed to collect saliva during the last day of use of the actigraph at 08: 00 am, 4: 00 pm and 10: 00 pm. The subjects answered the Self- Reporting Questionnaire- 20 ( SRQ- 20) to measure the presence of minor psychiatric disorders; the Montgomery- Asberg ( MA) scale was used to measure depression symptoms, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire ( PSQI) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep. The Rayleigh analysis indicates that the two groups, `` with window'' an d `` without window'', exhibited similar activities and light acrophases. In relation to light exposure, the mesor was significantly higher ( t 2.651, p 0.023) in t he `` with window'' group ( 191.04 133.36) than in the `` without window'' group ( 73.8 42.05). Additionally, the `` with window'' group presented the highest amplitude of light exposure ( 298.07 222.97). Cortisol levels were significantly different between the groups at 10: 00 pm ( t 3.009, p 0.008; `` without window'' ( 4.01 0.91) `` with window'' ( 3.10 0.30)). In terms of the melatonin levels, the groups differed at two different times of day: 08: 00 am ( t 2.593, p 0.018) and 10: 00 pm ( t 2.939, p 0.009). The `` with window'' group had a lower melatonin level at 08: 00 am ( 3.54 0.60) but a higher level at 10: 00 pm ( 24.74 4.22) than the `` without window'' group. Higher cortisol levels were positively correlated with minor psychiatric disorders and depressive symptoms ( MA) at 10: 00 pm. Lower melatonin levels at 10: 00 pm were correlated with depressive symptoms and poor quality of sleep ( PSQI). Our study demonstrated that not only may light pollution affect human physiology but also lack of exposure to natural light is related to high levels of cortisol and lower levels of melatonin at night, and these, in turn, are related to depressive symptoms and poor quality of sleep.	6.2
Purpose of reviewDendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells which link innate and adaptive immunity, through recognition and presentation of antigen to T cells. Although the importance of dendritic cells has been demonstrated in many animal models, their contribution to human immunity remains relatively unexplored in vivo.Given their central role in infection, autoimmunity, and malignancy, dendritic cell deficiency or dysfunction would be expected to have clinical consequences.Recent findingsHuman dendritic cell deficiency disorders, related to GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) and interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) mutations, have highlighted the importance of dendritic cells and monocytes in primary immunodeficiency diseases and begun to shed light on their nonredundant roles in host defense and immune regulation in vivo. The contribution of dendritic cell and monocyte dysfunction to the pathogenesis of primary immunodeficiency disease phenotypes is becoming increasingly apparent. However, dendritic cell analysis is not yet a routine part of primary immunodeficiency disease workup.SummaryWidespread uptake of dendritic cell/monocyte screening in clinical practice will facilitate the discovery of novel dendritic cell and monocyte disorders as well as advancing our understanding of human dendritic cell biology in health and disease.	6.1
This paper presents a method to evaluate the computational cost of a function in embedded systems. This method, which uses the Least Squares method, is useful to see the sample time choice feasibility, in control applications. In this work, the developed method is used to evaluate the computational cost of the model-based predictive control to speed control of a shunt direct current motor. The method was tested using two embedded devices allowing to find the correct sample time for each device evaluated.	1.4
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a risk for substance use disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between adult ADHD symptoms, opioid use disorder, life dysfunction and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. 1057 heroin dependent patients on opioid substitution treatment participated in the survey. All patients were screened for adult ADHD symptoms using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1). 19.4% of the patients screened positive for concurrent adult ADHD symptoms status and heroin dependence. Education level was lower among patients with ADHD symptoms, but not significant with respect to non-ADHD patients. Patients with greater ADHD symptoms severity were less likely to be employed. A positive association was observed between ADHD symptoms status and psychiatric symptoms. Patients with ADHD symptoms status were more likely to be smokers. Patients on methadone had a higher rate of ADHD symptoms status compared to buprenorphine. Those individuals prescribed psychoactive drugs were more likely to have ADHD symptoms. In conclusion, high rate of ADHD symptoms was found among heroin dependent patients, particularly those affected by the most severe form of addiction. These individuals had higher rates of unemployment, other co-morbid mental health conditions, heavy tobacco smoking. Additional psychopharmacological interventions targeting ADHD symptoms, other than opioid substitution, is a public health need.	5.0
We show the promotion intervention has positive effects during intergroup contact, but that high levels of compunction can have negative effects. Intergroup contact is probably the longest standing and most comprehensively researched intervention to reduce discrimination. It is also part of ordinary social experience, and a key context in which discrimination is played out. In this paper, we explore two additional interventions which are also designed to reduce discrimination, but which have not yet been applied to real intergroup interactions. The promotion intervention encourages participants to relax and enjoy an interaction, while the compunction intervention motivates participants to avoid discrimination. Across two studies, we tested the separate effects of promotion (Study 1) and then compunction (Study 2) on participants' interactions with a confederate whom they believed to have a history of schizophrenia. In Study 1, participants received either a promotion intervention to relax and have an enjoyable dialogue or no intervention (control; n = 67). In Study 2, participants completed a Single-Category Implicit Attitude Test before being told that they were high in prejudice (high compunction condition) or low in prejudice (low compunction condition; n = 62). Results indicated that promotion was associated with broadly positive effects: participants reported more positive experience of the interaction (enjoyment and interest in a future interaction), and more positive evaluations of their contact partner (increased friendliness and reduced stereotyping). There were no effects on participants' reported intergroup anxiety. In contrast, high compunction had broadly negative effects: participants reported more negative experiences of the interaction and more negative evaluations of their contact partner (using the same dependent measures outlined above). In addition, participants in the high compunction condition reported increased intergroup anxiety and increased self-anxiety (anxiety around thinking or doing something that is prejudiced). Participants in the high compunction condition also reported reduced expectancies of self-efficacy (i.e., they were less confident that they would be able to make a good impression).	2.0
Variations in DNA copy number carry important information on genome evolution and regulation of DNA replication in cancer cells. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology allows one to explore gene expression heterogeneity among single-cells, thus providing important cancer cell evolution information. Single-cell DNA/RNA sequencing data usually have low genome coverage, which requires an extra step of amplification to accumulate enough samples. However, such amplification will introduce large bias and makes bioinformatics analysis challenging. Accurately modeling the distribution of sequencing data and effectively suppressing the bias influence is the key to success variations analysis. Recent advances demonstrate the technical noises by amplification are more likely to follow negative binomial distribution, a special case of Poisson distribution. Thus, we tackle the problem CNV detection by formulating it into a quadratic optimization problem involving two constraints, in which the underling signals are corrupted by Poisson distributed noises. By imposing the constraints of sparsity and smoothness, the reconstructed read depth signals from single-cell sequencing data are anticipated to fit the CNVs patterns more accurately. An efficient numerical solution based on the classical alternating direction minimization method (ADMM) is tailored to solve the proposed model. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method Using both synthetic and empirical single-cell sequencing data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance and high promise of success with single-cell sequencing data.

In this research, open-source software tools and virtual interactive technology available are integrated to develop an emulated, effective, learning environment for distance education.	3.2
Identifying the origins of social bias is critical to devising strategies to overcome prejudice. In two experiments, we tested the hypothesis that young children can catch novel social biases from brief exposure to biased nonverbal signals demonstrated by adults. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, we found that children who were exposed to a brief video depicting nonverbal bias in favor of one individual over another subsequently explicitly preferred, and were more prone to behave prosocially toward, the target of positive nonverbal signals. Moreover, in Experiment 2, preschoolers generalized such bias to other individuals. The spread of bias observed in these experiments lays a critical foundation for understanding the way that social biases may develop and spread early in childhood.	2.0
Development of a novel highly sensitive headspace sorptive extraction (HSSE) method in combination with thermal desorption gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (TD-GC/MS) allowed the identification of thymol and several phase I metabolites in human urine. Combined with an enzymatic hydrolysis of glucuronated or sulphated phase II metabolites of thymol and of the respective phase I metabolites prior to analysis, even trace quantities of hitherto not detected thymol phase I metabolites could be identified in urine samples of test persons after oral administration of 50 mg thymol. It was proven, that human metabolism leads to a hydroxylation of the aromatic ring as well as of the isopropyl side chain. Hydroxylation of the iso-propyl group results in the formation of the rather unstable p-cymene-3,8-diol and the corresponding dehydration product p-cymene-3-ol-8-ene which could be clearly detected in human urine samples. Furthermore, the aromatic hydroxylation products p-cymene-2,5-diol, its oxidation product p-cymene-2,5-dione and p-cymene-2,3-diol were also unambiguously identified by comparison with synthesized reference compounds.

This study explored stereotype constructions people may impute on to others in the context of a contagious disease epidemic. Participants were 30 undergraduate students from a large university in Johannesburg, South Africa. They completed the open-ended Build-A-Character Questionnaire, which described the typical person in South Africa who they currently believed to be at particular risk of HIV infection. The data were thematically analysed and interpreted. Seven themes resulted, based on the stereotyping of marginalised groups in South Africa considered as being at higher risk for HIV due to historical disadvantage: blacks, women, and the poor. A social cognitive framework explains these stereotypes as they apply to perceived out-groups, and they carry risk to undermine public health interventions regarding the HIV pandemic in South Africa across population segments.	2.0
Power electronic converters are single input multiple output (SIMO) systems in frequency domain. In distributed power system (DPS), one converter's switching frequency ripples are another converter's perturbations, and beat frequency components are generated due to their SIMO characteristics. As the control loops of power converters always take high gains in low-frequency regions if the beat frequency components are relatively low, they may be magnified and presented as oscillations, which will introduce system instability. This paper proposes a matrix-based multifrequency output impedance model to describe the SIMO characteristics of power converters and to analyze the stability of DPS. The buck converter is specifically illustrated as demonstration. The proposed model indicates that the variation of switching frequency, as well as those traditionally discussed parameters of control loops and passive components, could also change output impedance characteristics and introduce system instability. In DPS, the beat frequency oscillation that traditional models fail to explain could be accurately predicted by the proposed model. In addition, based on the proposed model, the switching frequencies for power converters can be optimized to improve the stability of power electronic-based systems. Simulation and experimental results validate the accuracy and the effectiveness of the proposed method.	1.4
Although the Oct4/Sox2 complex is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells, the molecular basis underlying its regulation during lineage-specific differentiation remains unknown. Here, we revealed that the highly conserved Oct4/Lys-156 is important for maintaining the stability of the Oct4 protein and the intermolecular salt bridge between Oct4/Lys-151 and Sox2/Asp-107 that contributes to the Oct4/Sox2 interaction. Post-translational modifications at Lys-156 and K156N, a somatic mutation detected in bladder cancer patients, both impaired the Lys-151-Asp-107 salt bridge and the Oct4/Sox2 interaction. When produced as a recombinant protein or overexpressed in pluripotent stem cells, Oct4/K156N, with reduced binding to Sox2, significantly down-regulated the stemness genes that are cooperatively controlled by the Oct4/Sox2 complex and specifically up-regulated the mesendodermal genes and the SNAIL family genes that promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, we conclude that Oct4/Lys-156-modulated Oct4/Sox2 interaction coordinately controls the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and mesendoderm specification induced by specific differentiation signals.	6.1
The treatment of renal failure has changed little in decades. Organ transplantation and dialysis continue to represent the only therapeutic options available. However, decades of fundamental research into the response of the kidney to acute injury and the processes driving progression to chronic kidney disease are beginning to open doors to new options. Similarly, continued investigations into the cellular and molecular basis of normal kidney development, together with major advances in stem cell biology, are now delivering options in regenerative medicine not possible as recently as a decade ago. In this review, we will discuss advances in regenerative medicine as it may be applied to the kidney. This will cover cellular therapies focused on ameliorating injury and improving repair as well as advancements in the generation of new renal tissue from stem/progenitor cells.	6.1
Background: Fasciolosis remains a significant food-borne trematode disease causing high morbidity around the world and affecting grazing animals and humans. A deeper understanding concerning the molecular mechanisms by which Fasciola hepatica infection occurs, as well as the molecular basis involved in acquiring protection is extremely important when designing and selecting new vaccine candidates. The present study provides a first report of microarray-based technology for describing changes in the splenic gene expression profile for mice immunised with a highly effective, protection-inducing, multi-epitope, subunit-based, chemically-synthesised vaccine candidate against F. hepatica. Methods: The mice were immunised with synthetic peptides containing B-and T-cell epitopes, which are derived from F. hepatica cathepsin B and amoebapore proteins, as novel vaccine candidates against F. hepatica formulated in an adjuvant adaptation vaccination system; they were experimentally challenged with F. hepatica metacercariae. Spleen RNA from mice immunised with the highest protection-inducing synthetic peptides was isolated, amplified and labelled using Affymetrix standardised protocols. Data was then background corrected, normalised and the expression signal was calculated. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool was then used for analysing differentially expressed gene identifiers for annotating bio-functions and constructing and visualising molecular interaction networks. Results: Mice immunised with a combination of three peptides containing T-cell epitopes induced high protection against experimental challenge according to survival rates and hepatic damage scores. It also induced differential expression of 820 genes, 168 genes being up-regulated and 652 genes being down-regulated, p value <0.05, fold change ranging from -2.944 to 7.632. A functional study of these genes revealed changes in the pathways related to nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species production, Interleukin-12 signalling and production in macrophages and Interleukin-8 signalling with up-regulation of S100 calcium-binding protein A8, Matrix metallopeptidase 9 and CXC chemokine receptor 2 genes. Conclusion: The data obtained in the present study provided us with a more comprehensive overview concerning the possible molecular pathways implied in inducing protection against F. hepatica in a murine model, which could be useful for evaluating future vaccine candidates.	6.3
Aim: The objective of the present meta-analysis was to investigate whether or not cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) polymorphisms are associated with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) susceptibility. Methods: A systematic search was conducted from the PubMed, ENBASE, and Springer link database up to April 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the strength of association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) and AS risk. A subgroup analysis based on geographic region and a sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results: Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including 918 cases and 845 controls. The results showed that no significant association was found between AS and CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) for the additive model (G vs. A), dominant model (GG+AG vs. AA), co-dominant model (GG vs. AA, AG vs. AA) and recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA). The OR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.38), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89-1.51), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75-1.46), 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.52) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.79-1.23), respectively. Although subgroup analysis demonstrated no association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) polymorphisms and susceptibility to AS in Europe and Taiwan, an association was found in Iran through both the co-dominant and dominant models. Exclusion of any individual study did not alter the significance of the final outcome, excepting the result by omitting the study by Huang etal. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the CTLA-4 may not be a major susceptibility locus in humans with AS. The relationship between them may be affected by different geographic populations.	5.3
Due to a significant drop in the energy needed for RO desalination from 12 kWh/m(3) to-2 kWh/m(3) over the past 20 years, which is close to the theoretical minimum for recovering salt-free water from seawater of 1 kWh/m(3), the focus here is on the critical aspects that offer opportunities to further reduce costs. These include pre- and post-treatment; and analysis and optimization of the performance of RO systems, such as selectivity, capacity, and flux decline. Flux decline includes concentration polarization and fouling from inorganic, organic, and biological constituents. We call these the three legs that undergird all membrane processes. The approach here is quantitative and includes detailed fluid mechanics and associated mass transfer of RO systems for optimizing performance. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	3.4
This study examined the relationship between child language skills and parent and child gestures of 58 youths with and without an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Frequencies and rates of total gesture use as well as five categories of gestures (deictic, conventional, beat, iconic, and metaphoric) were reliably coded during the collaborative Tower of Hanoi task. Children with ASD had lower Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores and gestured less and at lower rates compared to typically developing children. Gesture use was unrelated to vocabulary for typically developing children, but positively associated with vocabulary for those with ASD. Demographic correlates of gesturing differed by group. Gesture may be a point of communication intervention for families with children with ASD.	2.3
Ambient Intelligence and Ambient Assisted Living systems are required to provide a natural user experience, where the interaction is resolved by using devices and modalities adapted to the user abilities and preferences, and even to the environment conditions. Because of the variety of devices and technologies, and the diversity of scenarios, developing these interaction systems is a complicated task. This paper proposes an UI abstraction framework for the development of AmI and AAL systems that effectively improves the portability of those systems between different environments. It allows developers to design and implement a single UI capable of being deployed with different devices and modalities regardless the physical location.	4.0
It is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting shoots after fire in chaparral shrublands. By contrast, little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. We hypothesized that vascular traits, both functional and structural, would also shift in order to support this heightened level of gas exchange and growth. We examined stem xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and resistance to cavitation (P-50) for eight chaparral shrub species as well as several potential xylem structural determinants of hydraulic function and compared established unburned plants and co-occurring post-fire resprouting plants. Unburned plants were generally more resistant to cavitation than resprouting plants, but the two groups did not differ in K-s. Resprouting plants had altered vessel structure compared with unburned plants, with resprouting plants having both wider diameter vessels and higher inter-vessel pit density. For biomechanics, unburned plants had both stronger and denser stem xylem tissue than resprouting plants. Shifts in hydraulic structure and function resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration. The interaction between time since disturbance (i.e. resprouting versus established stands) and drought may complicate attempts to predict mortality risk of resprouting plants. It is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting plants after fire in chaparral shrublands, but little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. The ecophysiology of eight species of chaparral shrubs was compared between resprouting plants and adjacent unburned plants. Resprouting plants varied from unburned plants in their hydraulics, xylem structure and biomechanics. The observed shifts resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration than unburned plants and demonstrate potential variability of plants in their hydraulic physiology depending on disturbance recovery state.	3.1
To improve the availability of the software-defined networking (SDN) under distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, a multi-queue SDN controller scheduling algorithm based on time slice allocation strategy is proposed. The proposed algorithm can take different time slice allocation strategies according to the intensity of DDoS attacks and use SDN controller to schedule processing flow request from different switches (including the switches suffering from different degrees of attacks and normal switches) to ensure better protection to the normal switch in the network under DDoS attacks. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	0.2
Nonoperative management of fractures in the setting of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) or ankylosing spondylitis is often unsuccessful. The subaxial spine is a common site of hyperextension fractures in the setting of DISH. Fractures of the upper cervical spine are uncommon in DISH. We report, to our knowledge, the first case describing successful nonoperative management of a type 2 odontoid fracture in a patient with DISH. We discuss the patient's initial presentation, physical examination, imaging findings, and management. A 73-year-old male presented with neck pain to the emergency department after sustaining a ground-level fall. Computed tomography of the cervical spine demonstrated a minimally displaced type 2 odontoid fracture in the setting of extensive DISH. He was immobilized with a hard cervical collar as the definitive management of his fracture. The collar was discontinued after 3 months. At his 2-year follow-up, he had a stable fibrous nonunion at the fracture site with tolerable neck pain. Flexion-extension radiographs demonstrated a stable alignment, and nonoperative management was continued. In selected patients with odontoid fractures in the setting of DISH, there is a role for nonoperative management alongside close monitoring.	5.3
The drive to eat is regulated by two compensatory brain pathways termed as homeostatic and hedonic. Hypothalamic orexinergic (ORX) neurons regulate metabolism, feeding and reward, thus controlling physiological and hedonic appetite. Circadian regulation of feeding, metabolism and rhythmic activity of ORX cells are driven by the brain suprachiasmatic clock. How the circadian clock impacts on ORX signalling and feeding-reward rhythms is, however, unknown. Here we used mice lacking the nuclear receptor REV-ERB, a transcription repressor and a key component of the molecular clockwork, to study food-reward behaviour. Rev-Erb mutant mice showed highly motivated behaviours to obtain palatable food, an increase in the intake and preference for tasty diets, and in the expression of the ORX protein in the hypothalamus. Palatable food intake was inhibited in animals treated with the ORX1R antagonist. Analyzing the Orx promoter, we found Retinoic acid-related Orphan receptor Response Element binding sites for Rev-Erb. Furthermore, Rev-Erb dampened the activation of Orx in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide evidence for a possible repressive role of Rev-Erb in the regulation of ORX signalling, highlighting an implication of the circadian clockwork in modulating food-reward behaviours with an important impact for the central regulation of overeating.	5.0
This paper presents a perception sensor network (PSN) for detect audio-based emergency situations such as human scream. The PSN consists of multiple units, each has a Kinect and a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Audio signals, which are acquired by the Kinect microphone array, are used in sound source classification and sound source localization. In order to work in multi-person scenarios, we propose an audio-visual fusion method to detect a single speaking person among multiple ones. The PSN system was demonstrated in a scenario having four persons, where the system is able to detect and localize the screaming person and send a robot to that location to check his/her condition.	4.0
The crop production in the district of Kasaragod in Kerala State (India) is characterized by low input-low yield concept and rain-fed agriculture. A field study was conducted in Western Ghat region of the district to develop a suitable rainwater harvesting system adoptable to hilly terrains and to test its efficacy for improving the use efficiency of the harvested water by its multiple uses. The cost-benefit analysis of the water harvesting system was also carried out to find out its affordability to farmers. The water harvesting system has been developed by integrating three components: (i) improving the productivity of coconut and component crops in the cropping units (ii) developing multiple water use systems, and (iii) the conjunctive use of the harvested water along with other surface and groundwater resources. Based on the estimated annual costs and returns, the Benefit -Cost ratio was found to be 1.69 and all other financial viability criteria (IRR and NPV) were also found favourable for investment on a lined water harvesting tank integrated with a micro-irrigation system and fish farming. The study suggested that the rainwater harvesting could be implemented as a viable alternative to conventional water supply or on-farm irrigation projects considering the fact that any land anywhere can be used to harvest rainwater. Further, the water use efficiency can be improved through effective harvesting and subsequent multiple uses of stored water.	4.3
This paper presents a three-dimensional model of the refrigerant-oil two phase flow developed with the aim of predicting the oil retention in evaporators of air-conditioning systems. The developed model is based on the two-fluid model approach. The governing mass, momentum and energy balance equations are written for each phase. The gas phase is the refrigerant vapor, while the liquid phase is the mixture of liquid refrigerant and oil. The balance equation for the oil mass fraction in the mixture with liquid refrigerant is included. Transfer processes at the vapor-liquid interfaces and on the flow channel walls are predicted with closure laws. The model is solved by the in-house computer code based on the SIMPLE type numerical procedure. The model is validated by comparing numerically predicted refrigerant mass and oil retention data in a brazed plate and fin evaporator, typically used in automotive applications, against measured values. Two sets of experiments performed with refrigerants R134a and R1234yf in the mixture with PAG oil are simulated. The numerical results provide a complete picture of the two-phase flow structure in the evaporator. Model predicts that oil is mainly retained in the bottom header and in smaller amounts in the top header and in parallel evaporating channels with upward refrigerant flow. The developed three-dimensional modeling and numerical approach has the advantage of being more reliable for the prediction of oil retention than existing one-dimensional models.

Sterile (noninfected) inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of many widespread diseases, such as allergies and autoimmune diseases. The evolutionarily conserved innate immune system is considered to play a key role in tissue injury recognition and the subsequent development of sterile inflammation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Here, we show that cholesterol sulfate, a molecule present in relatively high concentrations in the epithelial layer of barrier tissues, is selectively recognized by Mincle (Clec4e), a C-type lectin receptor of the innate immune system that is strongly up-regulated in response to skin damage. Mincle activation by cholesterol sulfate causes the secretion of a range of proinflammatory mediators, and s.c. injection of cholesterol sulfate results in a Mincle-mediated induction of a severe local inflammatory response. In addition, our study reveals a role of Mincle as a driving component in the pathogenesis of allergic skin inflammation. In a well-established model of allergic contact dermatitis, the absence of Mincle leads to a significant suppression of the magnitude of the skin inflammatory response as assessed by changes in ear thickness, myeloid cell infiltration, and cytokine and chemokine secretion. Taken together, our results provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying sterile inflammation.	5.1
To better understand how sleep/wake dysregulation affects Alzheimer's disease (AD), we compared the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin and histamine/tele-methylhistamine (HA/t-MHA) levels of 82 patients (41 probable-AD-high level of evidence, 41 mild cognitive impairment MCI-due-to-AD), 24 other neurologic disorders (OND) and 24 controls. We determined the relationships between these biomarkers, the CSF AD biomarkers concentrations, and the clinical sleep profile. CSF orexin-A but not HA/t-MHA levels were higher in MCI and AD than OND and controls. CSF orexin-A is correlated to CSF amyloid-beta(42) in MCI and AD, independently of age, gender, MMSE, total-tau/phosphorylated-tau, HA or sleep parameters. Nighttime sleep duration was longer in MCI and AD patients than controls. In MCI, nighttime sleep duration negatively correlated with CSF amyloid-beta(42) and MMSE. To conclude, CSF orexin-A but not HA/tHMA was upregulated in AD and correlated with amyloid-beta(42) level. Our data suggested a change in the sleep-wake pattern at an early stage of the disease that needs further investigation to deeply explain the mechanistic interplay between sleep and Alzheimer.

According to theoretical approaches, such as the influence of presumed media influence approach, individuals' attitudes and behaviors are affected by the influences they believe the media has on others. Politicians, for example, are thought to perform media relations activities because they ascribe great importance to the media. This has been tested regarding politicians' online activities using data from two surveys of members of Germany's national parliament, the Bundestag ( n(t1/t2) = 194/149). It was hypothesized that parliamentarians use Facebook and Twitter more extensively when they believe that these social media tools have a strong political influence on the public, journalists, and other politicians. However, the results indicate that parliamentarians use Facebook and Twitter regardless of whether they expect it to have an impact on other people. Therefore, politicians' online activities are determined by other reasons and not such strategic motives. Thus, although ( or precisely because) the hypotheses are rejected, the findings are an important contribution to the research on politicians' motives for online communication.	2.2
The triggers for the onset of oral diseases are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to characterize the oral bacterial community in healthy humans and its association with nutrition, oral hygiene habits, and the release of the inflammatory marker IL-8 from gingival epithelial cells (GECs) with and without stimulation by bacterial endotoxins to identify possible indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with inflammatory marker status. GECs from 21 healthy participants (13 females, 8 males) were incubated with or without addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), and the oral microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene-targeted sequencing. The basal IL-8 release after 6 h was between 9.9 and 98.2 pg/ml, and bacterial communities were characteristic for healthy oral microbiota. The composition of the oral microbiota was associated with basal IL-8 levels, the intake of meat, tea, white wine, sweets and the use of chewing gum, as well as flossing habits, allergies, gender and body mass index. Additionally, eight OTUs were associated with high basal levels of IL-8 and GEC response to LPS, with high basal levels of IL-8, and 1 with low basal levels of IL8. The identification of indicator bacteria in healthy subjects with high levels of IL-8 release is of importance as they may be promising early warning indicators for the possible onset of oral diseases.	5.1
Introduction/Objective Digital 3D modeling is slowly becoming an everyday orthodontic practice, and after two decades of research and development it is a basic element of e-orthodontics. The aim of this study was development and use of geometric entities on 3D digital models for diagnosing, planning and monitoring of orthodontic therapy, by using CAD (computer aided design) systems. Methods Statistical analysis and synthesis of 54 orthodontic parameters (28 in the upper and 26 in the lower jaw), defining three hypotheses and their testing, the application of the t-test. Results All three hypotheses are confirmed, convenience of using geometric entities, higher accuracy of 3D digital models, and more substantial displacement of teeth in the first six months of therapy (Student's t-test). After the first six months, distances in the x-y plane (occlusal plane) were bigger in both the upper and the lower jaw; additionally, the distances in the y-z plane (medial plane) decreased on the left and right side, so we can say that the first phase of therapy had success and that both jaws are wider. At the next four controls, parameters showed slight progress that was not statistically significant. Overall, after 11 months of therapy, there was a considerable improvement in the x-y plane, while changes in distances of clinical crown heights were very small. This could be explained by the fact that, during therapy, by using different arches, upper molars were pushed inside, toward the palate. Analyzing 3D computer models, we could notice that in this plane displacement of the upper left first molar was larger. Conclusion The use of geometric entities for defining orthodontic parameters gives us new possibilities for accurate and reliable analysis of patient's orthodontic condition.	3.0
This paper presents a digital control technique to achieve valley switching in a bidirectional flyback converter used to drive a dielectric electroactive polymer-based capacitive incremental actuator. This paper also provides the design of a low input voltage (24 V) and variable high output voltage (0-2.5 kV) bidirectional dc-dc flyback converter for driving a capacitive incremental actuator. The incremental actuator consists of three electrically isolated-mechanically connected capacitive actuators. It requires three high-voltage (HV) (2-2.5 kV) bidirectional dc-dc converters to accomplish the incremental motion by charging and discharging the capacitive actuators. The bidirectional flyback converter employs a digital controller to improve the efficiency and charge/discharge speed using the valley switching technique during both charge and discharge processes, without the need to sense signals on the output HV side. Experimental results verifying the bidirectional operation of a HV flyback converter are presented using a 3-kV polypropylene-film capacitor as the load. The energy-loss distributions of the converter are presented when 4- and 4.5-kV HV MOSFETs are used on HV side. The flyback prototype with a 4 kV MOSFET demonstrated 89% charge energy efficiency to charge the capacitive load from 0 V to 2.5 kV, and 84% discharge energy efficiency to discharge it from 2.5 kV to 0 V.	1.4
Monitoring chronic wound [CW] healing is a challenging issue for clinicians across the world. Moreover, the health and cost burden of CWare escalating at a disturbing rate due to a global rise in population of elderly and diabetic cases. The conventional approach includes visual contour, sketches, or more rarely tracings. However, such conventional techniques bring forth infection, pain, allergies. Furthermore, these methods are subjective as well as time-consuming. As such, nowadays, non-touching and non-invasive CW monitoring system based on imaging techniques are gaining importance. They not only reduce patients ' discomfort but also provide rapid wound diagnosis and prognosis. This review provides a survey of different types of CW characteristics, their healing mechanism and the multimodal non-invasive imaging methods that have been used for their diagnosis and prognosis. Current clinical practices as well as personal health systems [m-health and e-health] for CW monitoring have been discussed.	5.1
Ambient intelligent systems such as Home and Building Automation Systems (HBAS) are becoming evermore accepted and capable of actuating automatically on behalf of users to fulfil their requests or enable activities. However, when multiple users interact with such systems, the requirements of activities often interfere resulting in conflicting actuations which HBAS ought to automatically detect and resolve. Yet, despite recent advances in HBAS, no ambient intelligent solution has been reported that is adequately grounded on knowledge analysis. The contributions of this article are twofold. First, it reviews relevant literature on Ambient Intelligence, conflict detection, conflict resolution and knowledge representation in HBAS. Second, it proposes and validates an ontological framework for conflict detection and resolution backed by knowledge-based analysis. Effectively, the proposed solution performs automatic environment actuations maximizing users comfort and energy efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.0
Based on the matching theory, the antecedence of partnership formation between Buyer and Supplier in manufacturing engineering is explored. The results show that strategic level matching and operational level matching are positively associated with partnership formation, and cultural level matching moderates effects of strategic level matching and operational level matching on partnership formation.	3.2
Reverse unknown protocol's hidden behavior has played an important role in the field of network security. The proposed work takes the captured messages and the binary code that implement the protocol both as the studied object. Dynamic Taint Analysis combined with Static Analysis is used for protocol analyzing. Firstly, monitor and analyze the process of protocol program parses the message in the virtual platform HiddenDisc prototype system developed by ourselves, record the protocol's public behavior, then based on our proposed Hidden Behavior Perception and Mining algorithm, static analyze the protocol's hidden behavior trigger conditions and hidden behavior instruction sequences. According to the hidden behavior trigger conditions, new protocol messages with the sensitive information are generated, and the hidden behaviors are executed by dynamic triggering. HiddenDisc prototype system can sense, trigger and analyze the protocol's hidden behaviors. According to the statistical analysis results, we propose the evaluation method of Protocol Execution Security. The experimental results show that the present method can accurately mining the protocol's hidden behaviors, and can evaluate unknown protocol's execution security.	0.2
Identifying the contents of a black-box electrical circuit is a challenging experiment. In this paper, we present an approach for identifying the topological structure of the circuit and estimating the values of the internal components, by applying input signals and measuring available signals. The black-box model is provided as a Simulink model, whose contents are not accessible to the students. The overall procedure is performed in Matlab/Simulink environment and the results are obtained for a given circuit and compared with the actual values. The experiment is performed by a group of undergraduate students and the assessment results show its effectiveness in challenging their knowledge.	1.2
Social disinhibition difficulties are common following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, clinically sensitive tools to objectively assess the difficulties are lacking. This study aimed to pilot a new clinical measure of social disinhibition, the social disinhibition task (SDT). Whether social disinhibition is dependent on the type of social information judgements required and whether disinhibited responses can be adjusted with additional guidance were also examined. Participants were 31 adults (25 Male) with moderate-to-severe TBI and 22 adult (17 Male) healthy control participants. Participants viewed scenes of complex social situations and were asked to describe a character in them (Part A), describe a character while inhibiting inappropriate or negative responses (Part B), and describe a character while not only inhibiting negative responses, but also providing positive responses (Part C). One-half of the items contained a faux pas requiring participants to make inferences about a character'smental state. TBI and control participants responded similarly to Part A, although control participants responded less positively than TBI participants in the faux pas items. TBI participants were significantly impaired on Part B indicating they experienced difficulties in inhibiting automatic responding. TBI participants were however able to adjust their responding in Part C so that they respond similarly to the control participants. Between group differences were not detected in reaction time. Overall, the SDT appears to be suitable to detect social inhibition difficulties in clinical settings and provides a new direction for remediation of the difficulties in individuals with TBI.	2.1
Water quality index is used to express the quality of water on both surface as well as subsurface by integrating various water quality parameters. The present work aimed to evaluate seasonal water quality index for Ooty Lake in the Nilgiris district, TamilNadu India. The physico?chemical parameter of water samples taken during two seasons (winter and summer) were analyzed to categorize the level of pollution in the study area. The results were compared with the water quality standards recommended by Environment Protection Act (2009). Based on the Water Quality Index, Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to identify the group of parameter that influence water quality and to evaluate the type of pollution in the lake. In addition to multivariate statistical analyses, the factor and principal component analysis were applied and the outcome showed that there were three types of pollution influencing the water quality namely, agricultural pollution, organic pollution and domestic waste water pollution. During the winter season, domestic waste water pollution was high, as rainwater flushed out in all the areas of watershed. During this season the lake receives a meager amount of water, and hence, the biological activities taking during the summer season has resulted in higher biological pollution. From the analyses, it was observed that there is no major impact by the agricultural pollution. The cluster analysis showed that there were three cluster values, and from the similarity groups among the sampling sites, it was noticed that direct discharge and improper drainage system of watershed caused more pollution in lakes.	4.4
Catalyst-free thermal polyesterification has recently emerged as a potential strategy for designing biodegradable thermoset polymers, particularly polyol-based polyesters for biomedical applications. These thermoset polyesters are synthesized through polycondensation of polyol and polyacid without the presence of catalyst or solvents. The mechanical properties, degradation rates, crystallinity, hydrophilicity, and biocompatibility can be controlled by adjusting the monomer feed ratios and curing conditions. These polyesters often degrade via surface erosion that allows the polymers to maintain structural integrity throughout hydrolysis. Additionally, polyol-based polyesters demonstrated good biocompatibility as non-toxic catalysts and/or solvents involved in the reaction, and the monomers used are endogenous to human metabolism which can be resorbed and metabolized in various physiological pathways. This review summarizes the polyol-based biodegradable polyesters that were synthesized by catalyst-free polyesterification.	6.2
Rainwater harvesting to irrigate small-scale gardens enhances food self-sufficiency to overcome rural poverty. So far rainwater harvesting is not encouraged by the Namibian National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy nor supported financially by the Namibian government. This study proposes two rainwater harvesting facilities to irrigate gardens; one collects rain from household roofs with tank storage, the second collects rain on a pond roof with pond storage. The aim of this paper is to assess the benefits of rainwater harvesting-based gardening and to propose policy and financing implications for the Namibian government. We investigate the benefits of rainwater harvesting through a literature review, a cost-benefit analysis, monitoring of project pilot plants and a comparison with the existing irrigation and drinking water infrastructure. The results indicate that rainwater harvesting offers numerous benefits in technological, economic, environmental and social terms. The facilities have a positive net present value under favourable circumstances. However, material investment costs pose a financing problem. We recommend that government fund the rainwater harvesting infrastructure and finance privately garden and operation and maintenance costs. Integrating these aspects into a national rainwater harvesting policy would create the conditions to achieve the benefits of an up-scale of rainwater harvesting based gardening in Namibia.	4.3
Purpose: Internet social media offers a rich source for soliciting the public's views on health issues. This qualitative research, using YouTube as a platform, aimed to explore the public's perspectives on management of dental fear and anxiety (DFA) in pediatric patients. Methods: Using three keywords (dental fear, dental phobia, and dental anxiety), YouTube videos were searched. Twenty-seven videos related to DFA in children and adolescents were reviewed by three investigators, including a nondental layperson. Inductive thematic analysis was adopted for interpreting the data. Results: Several strategies were considered useful for controlling DFA in pediatric patients, including: verbal and nonverbal communication to establish closeness and effective guidance (explanation, permission-seeking, reassurance, and negotiation); desensitization to dental settings and procedures; tell-show-do; positive reinforcement; distraction by imagination and thoughtful designs of clinic and parental presence and support. Some self-coping strategies adopted by patients alleviated their DFA, such as self-reasoning and trust-building through long-term connection. Dentists' clinical competence, favorable treatment outcomes, and state-of-the-art devices and technologies (dental lasers, intraoral camera, and adapted anaesthesia method) contributed to reducing DFA. Conclusions: Authentic testimonials in YouTube videos endorsed and interpreted a variety of strategies adoptable by patients, parents, and dental professionals for managing children's and adolescents' dental fears and anxieties.	2.3
This study started from the perspective of predicting science and technology competition, building on this to discuss the dynamic competition between Android and iOS by sales volume in each quarter. The Lotka-Volterra system of equations, one well-known competitive diffusion models, has been adopted to represent the competitive situations of the smartphone operating system market, with the Lyapunov function used to carry out equilibrium and stability analysis. The results showed that Android and iOS have a predator-prey relationship, in which iOS serves as the predator, and Android as a prey. The equilibrium and stability analysis show that both products are able to coexist in the market, and thus, each system has its own stable sales volume.	0.4
Purpose: To evaluate the effect of systemically used anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) medication on the thickness of corneal epithelium and stroma in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: A total of 125 eyes of 69 participants were included in this retrospective study of three groups: healthy participants (Group 1), AS patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha medication (Group 2), and AS patients receiving a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (Group 3). Results: According to anterior segment optical coherence tomography, the mean thickness of the corneal epithelium was significantly thicker in Group 2 than in Group 3 (51.6 +/- 3.2 mu m versus 50.4 +/- 3 mu m, p = 0.01), as was that of the stroma (475 +/- 33 mu m versus 443 +/- 29 mu m, p = 0.002). Conclusions: Anti-TNF-alpha medication and/or avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could improve the thickness of both the corneal epithelium and stroma in AS patients.	5.3
This paper proposes a novel unsupervised feature learning algorithm for land-use scene recognition on very high resolution remote sensing imagery. The proposed technique utilizes a multipath sparse coding architecture in order to capture multiple aspects of discriminative structures within complex remote sensing sceneries. Unlike the previous sparse coding and bag-of-visual-words-based techniques that rely on the handcrafted feature descriptors such as scale-invariant feature transform, the proposed technique extracts dense low-level features from the raw data, including the visual (RGB) data and near-infrared (NIR) data, using image patches of varying sizes at different layers. The proposed technique has been evaluated on three data sets, including the 21-category UC Merced land-use RGB data set with a 1-ft spatial resolution, the 9-category ground scene RGB-NIR data set, and the 10-category Singapore land-use RGB-NIR data set with a 0.5-m spatial resolution. The experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.	4.2
Research on how economic factors affect attitudes toward immigration often focuses on labor market effects, concluding that, because workers' skill levels do not predict opposition to low- versus highly skilled immigration, economic self-interest does not shape policy attitudes. We conduct a new survey to measure beliefs about a range of economic, political, and cultural consequences of immigration. When economic self-interest is broadened to include concerns about the fiscal burdens created by immigration, beliefs about these economic effects strongly correlate with immigration attitudes and explain a significant share of the difference in support for highly versus low-skilled immigration. Although cultural factors are important, our results suggest that previous work underestimates the importance of economic self-interest as a source of immigration policy preferences and attitudes more generally.	2.0
Functionalized polypropylene nonwoven (PP) geotextiles can be used as a new eco-friendly way to trap heavy metals in sediments. Chitosan was chosen as sorbent because of its ability to trap heavy metals, its natural origin (from shells) and its low cost. PP was first functionalized with acrylic acid using a low pressure cold plasma process, in order to bring reactive carboxylic functions onto the surface. Chitosan was then covalently grafted on the acrylic acid modified PP. The functionalized surfaces were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and evidence of chitosan grafting was given. The ability of the functionalized geotextile to trap heavy metals was then investigated. Copper was chosen as a model heavy metal, and artificial solutions of CuSO4 were prepared for the experiments. Sorption studies were carried out at 20 degrees C with Polypropylene-grafted-Acrylic acid-Chitosan (PP-g-AA-chitosan) varying the concentration of copper in polluted solutions to evaluate the maximum of adsorption of the surface: the textile can chelate copper increasingly as a function of the initial copper concentration until 830 ppm. At this concentration, it reaches a plateau at about 30 mg of trapped copper per gram of geotextile. The effects of pH and of the ionic strength (adsorption in a NaCl containing solution) were finally investigated. The trapping of Cu2+ decreases slowly when the ionic strength increases. When there are 30 g/L NaCl in the artificial polluted solution (like in seawater), only 20 mg of Cu2+ can be trapped per g of geotextile. Finally, the optimum pH to trap the maximum amount of copper was determined to be 4.8, which corresponds to the optimum pH for the chitosan solubility. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1
Comparative study has been performed to investigate the behavior of dredged fills on rigid (Model 1) and flexible (Model 2) containers. The study was focused on the sedimentation of soil fills and the development of total stresses. Model 1 is made of an acrylic cylinder and Model two is a scale-size geotextile tube. Results indicate that for rigid containers, significant decrease of the sediment height is apparent during the dewatering process. On the other hand, because the geotextile is permeable, the water is gradually dissipated during the filling process on flexible containers. Hence, significant loss in the tube height is not apparent during the duration of the test. Pressure spikes are apparent on rigid containers during the filling process which can be attributed to the confining effect due to hydrostatic pressure. For the flexible containers, the pressure readings gradually increases with time during the filling process and normalize at the end on the filling stage. No pressure spikes were apparent due to the gradual dissipation of pore water pressure.	4.1
Light weight engineering and composite technologies are key strategies in modem product development in mechanical engineering as well as in biomedical applications, where innovation is driven by novel material concepts and surface functionalities. Designed or customized surface properties by advanced coating technologies are an important discipline in this context. Ceramic, metallurgical and cermet layers can be manufactured in a most appropriate way by high energetic thermokinetic deposition techniques like plasma spraying, electric arc and last not least by supersonic flame spraying (HVOF). These technologies perform high deposition rates, high flexibility to use various materials and their combinations and applications in micro to macro scale products. The final properties of the coatings and layer composites do not just depend on the properties of the combined materials but, as in the case of ceramic coated light metals, are distinctly affected by the occurring residual stresses and their interaction with operational load stresses. With respect to the complex geometries of most components, their dimensional and positional tolerances a further strong influence of the robot kinematics of the plasma or HVOF torches during coating manufacturing is observed. By combining the expertise in materials and manufacturing engineering coatings and composites with high performance and reliability can be achieved. This is shown in the development of functionally coated cylinder liners and crankcases for ultra light weight engines as well as for ceramic coated bioinert and biodegradable substrates in medical surgery. It will be shown that cast engine block bores can be directly coated by using an automated HVOF process, obtaining improved coating results. The internal coating process by hypersonic flame spraying is a superior technological alternative to the APS process for high quality cylinder liner and engine crankcase applications. The applications of such ceramic and cermet coatings are not limited to automotive and biomedical applications, i. e. for wear and friction properties or biomedical compatibility, but can be used for tailored thermophysical, electrophysical or catalytic properties in various technical systems.	3.2
This paper presents the results of laboratory model tests of a surface strip footing on unreinforced and reinforced sand beds to investigate the effects of reinforcement length. Multiples of footing width B were employed in the tests, namely B. 2B, 3B, 5B and, in some tests, even 7B. The type and number of reinforcements were also varied to determine whether these parameters had an influence on the optimum reinforcement length. The comprehensive results from laboratory model tests on strip footings supported on a woven geotextile and different Geogrids are presented. The load settlement and Bearing Ratio values obtained from the model test program were compared. Based on the results, the length of footing required to achieve optimum improvement was determined for different numbers of reinforcement layers and different reinforcement types. It was also observed that the improvement obtained by reinforcing the subgrade was different for low settlement ratio values and large settlement values. (C) 2015 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

This paper presents a design of a short term duty electrical machine working in an extreme environment consisting of 80 degrees C ambient temperature and altitudes of over 30,000m. Higher power density is a key factor in the design wherein the machine's operation is required only for a short duty. The requirement of high power-to-weight and power-to-volume leads to a Permanent Magnet (PM) machine design, which is then optimized. Different slot and pole combinations, with both concentrated and distributed winding arrangements are considered. For the optimization, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used where analytical electromagnetic and thermal models are adopted together with Finite Element (FE) methods. It is shown that the adopted thermal model provides sufficient accuracy when predicting temperature rise within the winding. It is also shown that the designs are thermally limited where the pole numbers are limited by volt-amps drawn from the converter. The design consisting of a high slot number allows for improving the heat dissipation from the machine and thus, the weight can be minimized for the given torque production.	3.3
Ethnopharmacological relevance: The genus Mitragyna (Rubiacaeae) has been traditionally used in parts of Africa, Asia and Oceania. In recent years, there has been increased interest in species of Mitragyna with the introduction of products to western markets and regulatory uncertainty. Aim of the study: This paper reviewed the traditional ethnomedicinal uses of leaves for species belonging to the genus Mitragyna with reference to the botany and known chemistry in order to highlight areas of interest for products currently being sold as kratom. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Google Scholar, the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Internet Archive, Hathi Trust, and Biodiversity Heritage Library search engines in the spring of 2015, fall of 2016 and winter of 2017 to document uses of bark, leaf and root material. Results: Leaves of M. speciosa (kratom) had the most common documented ethnomedicinal uses as an opium substitute or remedy for addiction. Other species of Mitragyna were reportedly used for treating pain, however the mode of preparation was most often cited as topical application. Other uses of Mitragyna included treatment of fever, skin infections, and as a mild anxiolytic. Conclusions: Mitragyna species have been used medicinally in various parts of the world and that there is significant traditional evidence of use. Modern products that include formulations as topical application of liniments, balms or tinctures may provide effective alternatives for treatment of certain types of pains. Future research is required to establish safety and toxicology limits, medicinal chemistry parameters and the potential for different physiological responses among varying genetic populations to support regulatory requirements for Mitragyna spp.	5.0
Noting that general military regulations (GMR) contain numerous references to aspects of nonverbal behavior expressed as prescribed behavior, we considered necessary a new reading of GMR as nonverbal communication handbooks. This new reading is possible and it reveals important aspects with regard to opportunities of education or adequate training, in agreement with some good knowledge in the field of communication sciences. This paper aims at setting up a prescriptive nonverbal profile of the Romanian soldiers in relation to behavioral requirements resulting from the current GMR of the Romanian Armed Forces. The research method consists of documents analysis and comprises: 1. placement of four general normative documents into a different context (a communicative one); 2. identification of explicit and implicit nonverbal communication prescriptions included in the body of these normative texts; 3. analysis of the nonverbal prescription in relationship with the major classes of nonverbal behavior and 4. configuration of a nonverbal profile of Romanian soldiers based on the GMR behavioral prescriptions. In this respect, the paper is similar with some projective or normative documents (regulations, memoranda, etc.) developed by institutions such as the Army Research Institute for Behavioral and Social Sciences and the Committee on Opportunities in Basic Behavioral and Social Sciences Research of the US. Army (Katz et al., 2006; Blascovitch & Hartel, 2008; Yager et al., 2009 etc.), designed to identify the role of nonverbal communication in the military context, especially in the context of intercultural actions in different theaters of operations. Following this study, we intend to focus our future research in the field of nonverbal communication on the Romanian military context, in order to subsequently build a first necessary instrument for the development of nonverbal communicative competence within the Romanian Armed Forces.	2.3
The multi-scale modelling approach is a, powerful mathematical technique for simulating and analyzing complex biological systems such as the human body. This tool can help study the interactions of the various networks in a living organism, from the cellular level up to the population scale, in one framework. In this paper, a generic mathematical model is developed that describes human metabolism with 237 serum metabolites integrated with a chosen set of human metabolic networks. A new computational approach is presented for solving the resulting dynamic problem using parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA). To illustrate the performance of the proposed;Approach, the human hepatocyte genome scale model is selected for the metabolic network to be included. The simulation results show that the proposed approach has promise with respect to both computational efficiency and convergence. To demonstrate the potential application of the developed model, prediction of amino acid biomarkers for a set of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) is considered as an example. All the simulations are performed rising MATLAB and the COBRA toolbox. This framework has the potential to simulate various human metabolic disorders to help with the diagnosis of associated human diseases and to suggest novel treatment strategies. In addition, it opens the door to new opportunities for personalized medicine. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic. Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.2
The development of a humoral immune response to influenza vaccines occurs on a multisystems level. Due to the orchestration required for robust immune responses when multiple genes and their regulatory components across multiple cell types are involved, we examined an influenza vaccination cohort using multiple high-throughput technologies. In this study, we sought a more thorough understanding of how immune cell composition and gene expression relate to each other and contribute to interindividual variation in response to influenza vaccination. We first hypothesized that many of the differentially expressed (DE) genes observed after influenza vaccination result from changes in the composition of participants' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were assessed using flow cytometry. We demonstrated that DE genes in our study are correlated with changes in PBMC composition. We gathered DE genes from 128 other publically available PBMC-based vaccine studies and identified that an average of 57% correlated with specific cell subset levels in our study (permutation used to control false discovery), suggesting that the associations we have identified are likely general features of PBMC-based transcriptomics. Second, we hypothesized that more robust models of vaccine response could be generated by accounting for the interplay between PBMC composition, gene expression, and gene regulation. We employed machine learning to generate predictive models of B-cell ELISPOT response outcomes and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers. The top HAI and B-cell ELISPOT model achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.64 and 0.79, respectively, with linear model coefficients of determination of 0.08 and 0.28. For the B-cell ELISPOT outcomes, CpG methylation had the greatest predictive ability, highlighting potentially novel regulatory features important for immune response. B-cell ELISOT models using only PBMC composition had lower performance (AUC= 0.67), but highlighted well-known mechanisms. Our analysis demonstrated that each of the three data sets (cell composition,mRNA-Seq, and DNA methylation) may provide distinct information for the prediction of humoral immune response outcomes. We believe that these findings are important for the interpretation of current omics-based studies and set the stage for a more thorough understanding of interindividual immune responses to influenza vaccination.	0.1
Mechanical manufacturing engineering is an important professional basic course and degree course for mechanical design, manufacturing and automation and has an important position on the outstanding engineers' training program. The problems existed in the present course teaching of mechanical manufacturing engineering were detailed analyzed and the paper explored constructing the teaching curriculum system and teaching contents for the teaching of outstanding engineers' training and reforming the old, outdated teaching methods and means. The reformation results show that the students' learning enthusiasm and initiative are improved and their engineering consciousness and innovation ability have greatly been improved.	3.2
In Colombia, several communities with limited or uncertain access to drinking water services collect rainwater for various domestic uses. This paper presents the results of a water quality analysis of the rainwater runoff from roofs in Kennedy (Bogota) to evaluate the suitability of adapting this water to satisfy domestic uses in this district. Based on the high values of turbidity and biochemical oxygen demand, and on the high concentrations of total suspended solids and heavy metals found in the studied rainwater, it is concluded that the water samples are not suitable for any of the domestic uses currently employed by the citizenry. Nevertheless, a high spatial and temporal variability was detected, in addition to variability as a function of the roof material. In particular cases, the runoff water from roofs may be adapted as an alternative source for domestic uses in the district.	4.3
The paper reports on our work developing a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional approach to teaching Ethical, Social, Safety, Health, and Environmental Issues in Nanotechnology. Under a grant from NSF, we are developing, implementing, and assessing two modular courses that include societal, ethical, environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology for undergraduates in engineering and engineering technology. It is a collaborative project between Texas State University, a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and the University of Texas at Tyler (UT Tyler), whose student population is 60 percent women. The work is being conducted by a highly interdisciplinary team of faculty who bring to the project expertise from mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, industrial education and technology, physics, biology, philosophy, and ethics. Here we explain the origin of the project, explicate how we have developed the course modules, review the first two semesters (Summer and Fall 2013) teaching from these modules, and examine our initial results and evaluations.	3.2
Pro-social behaviours may be prompted or inhibited depending on the situation. Numerous experiments show that, when exposed to the idea of money, people are less willing to help, devote their time or share their resources with others (Vohs et al. Science, 314, 1154-1156, 2006, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 17(3), 208-212, 2008). Conversely, when exposed to the idea of spirituality, they often cheat less and are more willing to help others (Mazar and Ariely Journal of Marketing Research, 45, 633-644, 2008; Randolph-Seng and Nielsen The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 17(4), 303-315, 2007). The aim of this article is to present the results of two experiments in which we activated thoughts about money, i.e. both cash and credit cards, and thoughts about spirituality in order to find out in what way these two kinds of activation may influence pro-social behaviours. In experiment 1, participants, when reminded of money, offered lower donations to others whereas those reminded of spirituality offered higher donations. In experiment 2, those participants reminded of money offered to devote less time to help others whereas those reminded of spirituality offered to devote more time to help others.	2.4
We report a case of a 58 years old woman who presented for clinical picture consisting in skin rash, pruritus, astenia, mialgia, with progressive onset during the last month and recently discovered blood hypereosinophilia. The patient was exhaustively investigated and secondary causes for hypereosinophilia were excluded, mainly allergies, parasitic infections, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. On hospital admission the patient had no symptoms or personal history suggesting cardiac disease. The initial electrocardiography and echocardiography had minimal changes, but cardiac markers such as proBNP and troponin had high values. The clinical evolution was initially good, with moderate dose corticosteroid therapy, but eosinophilia, leukocytosis and cardiac markers continued to increase, followed by progressive cardiac ischemia and ultrasound changes. We considered a rare case of primary hypereosinophilic syndrome with severe cardiac involvement and we switched to high dose corticosteroid followed by add-on therapy with hydroxyurea. Blood eosinophilia decreased, but cardiac markers and ischemia continued to aggravate and unfortunately the patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest, after three weeks from hospital admission. We concluded that hypereosinophilic syndrome with early and progressive cardiac involvement is a severe and difficult to manage disease, with high fatality risk, that requires complex investigations, multidisciplinary approach and prompt therapy.	5.1
This paper explores the performance of a DC-DC converter based with current mode controller photovoltaic (PV) simulator which emulates the output characteristics of a real PV module. A portable PV simulator prototype of 85 W is examined in terms of its steady state IV curve matching capacity and the convergence time corresponding to step change in current source load, voltage source load, and insolation levels. The current voltage (IV) characteristics of the PV module are implemented as a look-up-table (LUT) which determines the reference output current from measured output voltage. A Thevenin Equivalent Method approach to PV arrays analysis is also included in order to model the small-signal linearized characteristics. Extensive simulation results obtained in MAT LAB are included to show that the PV simulator can work in most situations as a real PV module. Preliminary experimental results verify performance with current-source and voltage-source loads	1.4
As the world's population continues to grow, water pollution is presenting one of the biggest challenges worldwide. More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Fipronil (5 -amino-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonitrile) is a highly active, broad spectrum insecticide from the phenyl pyrazole family, which targets the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor. Although fipronil is presently widely used as an insecticide and acaricide, little information is available with respect to its metabolic fate and disposition in mammals. This study was designed to investigate the in vitro human metabolism of fipronil and to examine possible metabolic interactions that fipronil may have with other substrates. Fipronil was incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM) and several recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms obtained from BD Biosciences. HPLC was used for metabolite identification and quantification. Fipronil sulfone was the predominant metabolite via CYP oxidation. The K. and V-max values for human liver microsomes are 27.2 muM and 0.11 nmol/mg protein min, respectively; for rat liver microsomes (RLM) the K-m and V-max are 19.9 muM and 0.39 nmol/mg protein min, respectively. CYP3A4 is the major isoform responsible for fipronil oxidation in humans while CYP2C19 is considerably less active. Other human CYP isoforms have minimal or no activity toward fipronil. Co-expression of cytochrome b(5) (b5) is essential for CYP3A4 to manifest high activity toward fipronil. Ketoconazole, a specific inhibitor of CYP3A4, inhibits 78% of the HLM activity toward fipronil at a concentration of 2 muM. Oxidative activity toward fipronil in 19 single-donor HLMs correlated well with their ability to oxidize testosterone. The interactions of fipronil and other CYP3A4 substrates, such as testosterone and diazepam, were also investigated. Fipronil metabolism was activated by testosterone in HLM but not in CYP3A4 Supersomes(R). Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in HLM was inhibited by fipronil. Fipronil inhibited diazepam demethylation but had little effect on diazepam hydroxylation. The results suggest that fipronil has the potential to interact with a wide range of xenobiotics or endogenous chemicals that are CYP3A4 substrates and that fipronil may be a useful substrate for the characterization of CYP3A4 in HLM.

In order to make the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) concurrently compensate for low-order harmonics and voltage sag, and eliminate the influence of digital control on system performance, we propose a novel double closed-loop digital control strategy, consisting of the fundamental proportional resonant (PR) control in a voltage loop and selective harmonic PR control in an inductance current loop. Then, we mainly analyse the discretization effects of the virtual LC method and the step response method, and further present a straightforward digital design method. Next, with this method, we design the parameters of the fundamental and selective harmonic PR controllers in the discrete domain, which inhibit the influence of sampling, calculation delay etc. on the steady-state error and the dynamic response performance. Finally, an 11-kVA DVR prototype is developed and tested. The experimental results indicate that the proposed control strategy satisfies the requirement of voltage quality for sensitive loads and achieves a good dynamic response performance.	1.4
In this study, we investigated the formation of a co-amorphous system of tranilast (TRL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (DPH), which are drugs used for treating allergies and inflammation. The crystallization from undercooled melts of the drugs and drug mixtures was evaluated by thermal analysis. Both drugs in the amorphous state underwent crystallization on heating, although the mixture remained in the amorphous state, indicating the formation of a co-amorphous system. The physico-chemical properties of co-amorphous TRL-DPH prepared by the melting-cooling process were studied. The glass transition temperature of co-amorphous TRL-DPH deviated from the theoretical value. The enthalpy relaxation rate of the amorphous drugs, which reflected the molecular mobility, was reduced by the formation of a co-amorphous system. The intermolecular interactions between TRL and DPH in the co-amorphous system were measured by the change in the IR spectra. These results were consistent with the high physical stability. The co-amorphous sample remained in the amorphous state for over 30 days at 40 degrees C, whereas the amorphous drugs showed rapid crystallization. Our findings demonstrate that TRL and DPH form a co-amorphous system, which dramatically decreases their crystallization without an excipient. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association (R).

Inhibition of Ca2+ entry into the hippocampus and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) through inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist drugs is the current standard of care in neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and peripheral pain. Oxidative stress activates Ca2+-permeable TRPM2 and TRPV1, and recent studies indicate that selenium (Se) is a potent TRPM2 and TRPV1 channel antagonist in the hippocampus and DRG. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of Se in primary hippocampal and DRG neuron cultures of aged rats when given alone or in combination with scopolamine (SCOP). Thirty-two aged (18-24 months old) rats were divided into four groups. The first and second groups received a placebo and SCOP (1 mg/kg/day), respectively. The third and fourth groups received intraperitoneal Se (1.5 mg/kg/ over day) and SCOP + Se, respectively. The hippocampal and DRG neurons also were stimulated in vitro with a TRPV1 channel agonist (capsaicin) and a TRPM2 channel agonist (cumene hydroperoxide). We found that Se was fully effective in reversing SCOP-induced TRPM2 and TRPV1 current densities as well as errors in working memory and reference memory. In addition, Se completely reduced SCOP-induced oxidative toxicity by modulating lipid peroxidation, reducing glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. The Se and SCOP + Se treatments also decreased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations, apoptosis, and caspase 3, caspase 9, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization values in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the current study reports on the cellular level for SCOP and Se on the different endocytotoxic cascades for the first time. Notably, the research indicates that Se can result in remarkable neuroprotective and memory impairment effects in the hippocampal neurons of rats.	5.2
The purpose of this study was to develop a scale in Urdu language for measuring different dimensions of afterlife belief. The scale was subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of 504 individuals (235 men and 269 women) recruited from different cities in the Punjab, Pakistan. After exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, 16 items were retained with three well-defined factor structures of afterlife belief: positive, negative, and extinction. The alpha coefficients of the subscales ranged from .65 to .78. Convergent and discriminant validity of the subscales of Afterlife Belief Scale was determined by finding its relationship with the Pleasant Afterlife Belief Scale, the Unpleasant Afterlife Belief Scale, the Anxiety Subscale of DASS, and the Belief in Equitable World Scale. The results support that the newly developed scale has promising validity.	5.4
To evaluate the effects of mulching and ridge and furrow widths on soil temperature and moisture, crop growth and yield, and water use efficiency (WUE), a series of field experiments were conducted in a potato field in Inner Mongolia, China. In 2009 and 2010, four treatments (flat plot without mulching (CK), plastic film mulched ridge (MR), MRF (plastic film mulched ridge and furrow (MRF), and non-mulched (NM0.5)) were conducted on the same widths of ridge (0.5 m) and furrow (0.5 m), and two additional non-mulching treatments (1.0 m ridge and furrow width (NM1.0), and 1.5 m ridge and furrow width (NM1.5)) were tested in 2011 and 2012. The results indicated that mulching practices increased topsoil temperature compared to non-mulching treatments at the emergence stage. Compared to CK, the soil water storage in furrows was increased by 10.2 mm on average in 2009 for the MRF treatment, 8.1 mm and 15.1 mm in 2011, and 14.0 mm and 21.2 mm in 2012 for NM1.0 and NM1.5, respectively, and plant leaf area index and dry biomass values during the potato growth stage were also increased. The MR treatment produced greater effects on crop productivity than NM0.5, and increased total yield and marketable yield by 21.4% and 36.3% compared to CK in 2010. Of three non-mulching treatments (i.e., NM0.5, NM1.0, and NM1.5), the NM1.0 treatment produced the highest total yield and marketable yield; compared to CK, the WUE, total yield, and marketable yield were increased by 12.7%, 8.2%, and 52.0% in 2011, and 23.4%, 16.4%, and 81.0% in 2012, respectively.

Purpose: The aim of this paper was to study the feasibility of manufacturing a customizable trocar-cannula system for vitreoretinal surgery utilizing commercially available three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. Methods: A digital model of a trocar-cannula system for vitreoretinal surgery was created using computer-aided design (CAD) software and printed utilizing a laser-sintering 3D printer in modified ABS thermoplastic material. The trocar-cannula prototypes were tested in pig eyes. Results: A customizable digital model was created using commercially available CAD software. Three trocar-cannulas were printed. The smallest cannulas that could be printed had dimensions between 21 and 22G. The trocar-cannulas were inserted in pig eyes after performing sclerotomies with a commercially available 20G MVR blade. One cannula broke during insertion. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of printing a trans conjunctival vitrectomy trocar-cannula system with commercially available 3D print technology. The 3D printer and build material used resulted in trocar-cannulas with functional limitations including a minimum size achievable and mechanical resistance. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel	3.0
The program administrator and total cost of saved energy allow comparison of the cost of efficiency across utilities, states, and program types, and can identify potential performance improvements. Comparing program administrator cost with the total cost of saved energy can indicate the degree to which programs leverage investment by participants. Based on reported total costs and savings information for U.S. utility efficiency programs from 2009 to 2013, we estimate the savings-weighted average total cost of saved electricity across 20 states at $0.046 per kilowatt-hour (kW h), comparing favorably with energy supply costs and retail rates. Programs targeted on the residential market averaged $0.030 per kW h compared to $0.053 per kW h for nonresidential programs. Lighting programs, with an average total cost of $0.018 per kW h, drove lower savings costs in the residential market. We provide estimates for the most common program types and find that program administrators and participants on average are splitting the costs of efficiency in half. More consistent, standardized and complete reporting on efficiency programs is needed. Differing definitions and quantification of costs, savings and savings lifetimes pose challenges for comparing program results. Reducing these uncertainties could increase confidence in efficiency as a resource among planners and policymakers.	1.0
AIM To investigate serum mean platelet volume (MPV) levels in acute pancreatitis (AP) patients and assess whether MPV effectively predicts the disease severity of AP. METHODS We included 117 consecutive patients with AP as the AP group and 34 consecutive patients with colorectal polyps (before endoscopic treatment) as the control group. Complete blood counts, liver function, platelet indices (MPV), coagulation parameters, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after admission. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of MPV, white blood cell (WBC), LDH and CRP in predicting AP severity. The Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria were used to evaluate disease severity in AP. RESULTS MPV levels were significantly lower in the AP group than in the control group on day 1 (P = 0.000), day 2 (P = 0.029) and day 3 (P = 0.001) after admission. In addition, MPV values were lower on day 1 after admission than on day 2 (P = 0.012), day 3 (P = 0.000) and day 7 (P = 0.002) in all AP patients. Based on the mGPS, 78 patients (66.7%) were diagnosed with mild and 39 patients (33.3%) with severe AP. There was no significant difference in mean MPV levels between patients diagnosed with mild and severe AP based on the mGPS (P = 0.424). According to the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria, there were 98 patients (83.8%) without persistent organ failure (OF) [ non-severe acute pancreatitis (non-SAP) group] and 19 patients (16.2%) with persistent OF (SAP group). MPV levels were significantly lower in the SAP group than in the non-SAP group on day 1 after admission (P = 0.002). On day 1 after admission using a cut-off value of 6.65 fL, the overall accuracy of MPV for predicting SAP according to the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria (AUC = 0.716) had a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 47.4% and was superior to the accuracy of the traditional markers WBC (AUC = 0.700) and LDH (AUC = 0.697). CONCLUSION MPV can be used at no additional cost as a useful, noninvasive biomarker that distinguishes AP with persistent OF from AP without persistent OF on day 1 of hospital admission.	5.3
In CAD (computer aided design) environments, a surface is commonly modeled as a collection of connected regions represented by parametric mappings. For meshing such a composite surface, a parallelized indirect approach with dynamic load balancing can be used on a shared memory system. However, this methodology can be inefficient in practice because most existing CAD systems use memory caches that are only appropriate to a sequential process. Two solutions are proposed, referred to as the Pirate approach and the Discrete approach. In the first approach, the Pirate library can be efficiently called in parallel since no caching is used for the storage or evaluation of geometric primitives. In the second approach, the CAD environment is replaced by internal procedures interpolating a discrete geometric support. In both cases, performance measurements are presented and show an almost linear scaling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.0
The ability to unobtrusively measure velocity in the aquatic environment is a fundamental challenge for engineers and sport scientists. In the past video systems were the first choice to monitor the athletes during training. With the acceptance of small inertial sensors new ways of investigating the athletes movements have arisen. These small systems are light, easy to use and do not hinder the athlete during training, allowing an easy tracking of training improvements. This research used a self developed low-cost inertial sensor system, attached to the lower back, to record the acceleration of swimmers performing sub-surface wall push-offs. The recorded data were downloaded to MATLAB for data analysis. Using seven swimmers, the wall push-off velocity at three different efforts was analysed and compared to a tethered cable velocity meter (criterion measure) using Regression and Bland-Altman analysis. The maximum velocity determined from the accelerometer unit was linearly related to the benchmark criteria (r(2)=0.89). A biomechanical technique for the determination of the maximum glide velocity from acceleration data has been verified. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Cigarette smoking is associated with numerous diseases and poses a serious challenge to the current healthcare system worldwide. Smoking impacts both innate and adaptive immunity and plays dual roles in regulating immunity by either exacerbation of pathogenic immune responses or attenuation of defensive immunity. Adaptive immune cells affected by smoking mainly include T helper cells (Th1/Th2/Th17), CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and memory T/B lymphocytes while innate immune cells impacted by smoking are mostly DCs, macrophages and NK cells. Complex roles of cigarette smoke have resulted in numerous diseases, including cardiovascular, respiratory and autoimmune diseases, allergies, cancers and transplant rejection etc. Although previous reviews have described the effects of smoking on various diseases and regional immunity associated with specific diseases, a comprehensive and updated review is rarely seen to demonstrate impacts of smoking on general immunity and, especially on major components of immune cells. Here, we aim to systematically and objectively review the influence of smoking on major components of both innate and adaptive immune cells, and summarize cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying effects of cigarette smoking on the immune system. The molecular pathways impacted by cigarette smoking involve NF kappa B, MAP kinases and histone modification. Further investigations are warranted to understand the exact mechanisms responsible for smoking-mediated immunopathology and to answer lingering questions over why cigarette smoking is always harmful rather than beneficial even though it exerts dual effects on immune responses.	5.1
Intermittent sand filtration (ISF) is an efficient system for treatment of greywater; however, the high quality of effluent and the simple set-up contrast with the high failure rate due to clogging of surface layers. The efficacy of several polypropylene non-woven geotextiles (apparent opening size from 0.10 to 0.18 mm) used as primary treatment filters to remove suspended particles from domestic greywater and the effects of this pretreatment in the performance of fine and small media size (0.3 and 0.6 mm) ISFs was examined. Results showed geotextile achieved suspended solids (SS) removal rates from 25 to 85% and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 3 to 30%; although the portion larger than 75 mu m was removed at higher rates (55-90%), particles smaller than the nominal pore size of the filter were also captured. Geotextile used as pretreatment resulted in improvement of lifetime of the ISFs over an experimental run of 60 days. The vertical profile of volatile organic matter in the ISFs was evaluated at the end of the experiment and it showed a clear reduction in the accumulation of organic material on the top layer of the ISFs, effectively avoiding its early failure by accumulation of solids.	4.1
Background: Longitudinal, patient-centered care represents a challenge for general practitioners (GPs), and in this context, reminder systems can offer targeted support. This study aimed to identify details of such reminders: (1) contents of care addressed, (2) their mode of display in the electronic health record (EHR), (3) their visual appearance, (4) personnel responsibilities for editing and applying reminders, and (5) use of reminders for patient recall. Methods: This mixed-methods study comprised (1) a cross-sectional survey among 185 GP practices from a German university network, and (2) structured observations of reminder utilization in six practices based on a clinical vignette describing a multimorbid senior with 26 care needs. Descriptive statistics were performed for survey data. The practice observations were analyzed by portraying different types of reminders. Results: Seventy-three of 185 practices completed the survey (39.5%): 98.6% reported using reminders in the EHR. Frequent care contents addressed were allergies/adverse drug events (95.8%), preventive measures (93.1%), participation in disease management programs (87.5%), chronic diseases (75.0%), and upcoming vaccinations (68.1%). Practice observations showed a variety of mainly self-configured reminders. In a patients' EHR, information was displayed (1) compiled in a separate field, (2) scattered throughout the EHR, and/or (3) in a pop-up window. The visual appearance of electronic reminders varied: (1) colored fields with short text, (2) EHR entries and/or billing codes in pre-defined colors, (3) abbreviations within the treatment documentation, (4) symbols within the treatment documentation, (5) symbols linked to free text fields, and (6) traffic light schemes. Five practices self-designed reminders 'as needed'; one practice applied an EHR-embedded, pre-defined reminder system. Practices used reminders for a mean of 13.3 of the 26 aspects of care detailed in the clinical vignette (range: 9-21; standard deviation (SD): 4.3). Practices needed 20-35 min (mean: 27.5; SD: 6.1) to retrieve the information requested. Conclusions: Most GP practices use self-designed, visual reminders for some aspects of care, yet data-based, sophisticated solutions are needed to improve longitudinal care.	5.1
A simple synthetic-wavelength self-mixing interferometer is proposed for precision displacement measurement. Choosing the frequency difference of the orthogonally polarized dual frequency He-Ne laser appropriately, we introduce synthetic wavelength theory into self-mixing interference principle and demonstrate a feasible optical configuration by simply adjusting the optical design of self-mixing interferometer. The phase difference between the two orthogonally polarized feedback fringes is observed, and the tiny displacement of the object can be measured through the phase change of the synthetic signal. Since the virtual synthetic wavelength is 106 times larger than the operating wavelength, sub-nanometer displacement of the object can be obtained in millimeter criterion measurement without modulation, demodulation and complicated electrical circuits. Experimental results verifies the synthetic wavelength self-mixing interferometer's ability of measuring nanoscale displacement, which provides a potential approach for contactless precision displacement measurement in a number of scientific and industrial applications.

We propose an alternative approach to treat problems with axial or spherical symmetry. Its main characteristic consists of using Cartesian coordinates instead of curvilinear coordinates as usual. To this end, we derive general mathematical expressions giving the spatial derivatives of tensors of arbitrary order along the direction normal to an arbitrary meridian plane for systems with axial symmetry, or along two orthogonal directions normal to an arbitrary radius for systems with spherical symmetry. These relations allow the reduction of the initial three-dimensional problem to a domain with a lower dimension (two for axial symmetry, one for spherical symmetry), while keeping Cartesian coordinates within this domain. The method is illustrated for the flow of a Newtonian fluid between two coaxial cylinders (Couette cell), the Weissenberg effect for viscoelastic fluids and the flow of complex fluids like liquid crystals.	3.4
Multiracial individuals often do not easily fit into existing racial categories. Perceivers may adopt a novel racial category to categorize multiracial targets, but their willingness to do so may depend on their motivations. We investigated whether perceivers' levels of internal motivation to control prejudice (IMS) and external motivation to control prejudice (EMS) predicted their likelihood of categorizing Black-White multiracial faces as Multiracial. Across four studies, IMS positively predicted perceivers' categorizations of multiracial faces as Multiracial. The association between IMS and Multiracial categorizations was strongest when faces were most racially ambiguous. Explicit prejudice, implicit prejudice, and interracial contact were ruled out as explanations for the relationship between IMS and Multiracial categorizations. EMS may be negatively associated with the use of the Multiracial category. Therefore, perceivers' motivations to control prejudice have important implications for racial categorization processes.	2.2
Childhood obesity is an increasing problem in the Western world, and is affected by a multitude of interacting factors. Recent evidence suggests that taste perception may differ between obese and normal weight children. Evidence also suggests that perception of sweet and bitter taste is linked to differential food liking of various foods. To date, most studies have focused on single food items or food groups, rather than an overall view of dietary quality, and mainly on bitterness. Thus it is unclear whether taste perception is associated with dietary quality in children. Our objective was to examine the link between taste perception, dietary quality and body weight in Irish school children, in conjunction with other known influences of body weight. Taste perception was measured using the gLMS for bitter, salty and sweet stimuli. Detailed dietary intake data were collected from 525 children aged 7-13 via a 3-day diet history. Energy misreporters were identified and excluded from the dietary analyses, leaving n = 483 children. Dietary quality was assessed using Healthy Eating Index. Salivary DNA was collected and analyzed for variations in the bitter receptor gene TAS2R38. Sex differences were observed whereby intensity perception of sweetness was lower in the overweight/obese males, while no association was observed for sweet taste in the females. Despite the differences in weight status, taste perception was not associated with differences in overall dietary quality, measured via HEI score, in this cohort. Prospective cohort studies in children are necessary to better understand the association between taste intensity, food intake and weight over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	6.4
Background: The diagnostic construct of mild neurocognitive disorders (MNCDs) is substantially congruent with previously proposed criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MNCD/ MCI is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Previous studies have examined the prevalence of NPS in amnestic and non-amnestic MCI subtypes; however, no studies exist for etiological types of MNCD. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of NPS in patients with MNCD due to Alzheimer's disease (MNCD-AD) and subcortical vascular MNCD (ScVMNCD) and to determine whether NPS would expand these MNCD phenotypes. Methods: The sample comprised 70 patients with MNCD-AD, 70 patients with ScVMNCD, and 55 cognitively normal elderly persons (CNEP). The diagnosis of MNCD-AD was made according to DSM-5 criteria for possible MNCD-AD. ScVMNCD patients fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria of the probable vascular MNCD and the diagnostic criteria for subcortical vascular MCI according to Frisoni et al. (1). The prevalence of NPS was based on the neuropsychiatric inventory. The statistical analyses included parametric and non-parametric tests, multivariate regression, and Spearman's correlation coefficient. Results: About 69.1% of CNEP, 97.1% of MNCD-AD, and 100% of ScVMNCD patients had one or more NPS. The prevalence of NPS in both MNCD groups was significantly higher than that in CNEP. The most prevalent NPS that had significant differential diagnostic value in separating MNCD-AD from ScVMNCD, as well as MNCD from CNEP, were anxiety (81.43%) and irritability (67.14%) in MNCD-AD and depression (81.43%) in ScVMNCD. In both MNCD groups, we observed significant (p< 0.05) correlations between all distinguishing NPS and the differential cognitive disturbances: the amnestic syndrome in MNCD-AD and executive dysfunction in ScVMNCD. Conclusion: NPS occur in the majority of persons with MNCD-AD and ScVMNCD.Anxiety and irrtability are the most prevelant NPS in MNCD-AD, as well as depression in ScVMNCD.The ammestic-anxious-irritable syndrome can be the main phenotype in MNCD-AD, on the other hand,the dysexecutive-depressive syndrome can be considered as the most prevelant clinical manifestation in ScVMNCD.Obtained data may be used for clinical differentiation of MNCD-AD and ScVMNCD patients.	5.4
This paper presents an intercomparative study of 12 operationally produced large-scale datasets describing soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), and/or vegetation characteristics within agricultural regions of the contiguous United States (CONUS). These datasets have been developed using a variety of techniques, including, hydrologic modeling, satellite-based retrievals, data assimilation, and survey/in-field data collection. The objectives are to assess the relative utility of each dataset for monitoring crop yield variability, to quantitatively assess their capacity for predicting end-of-season corn and soybean yields, and to examine the evolution of the yield-index correlations during the growing season. This analysis is unique both with regards to the number and variety of examined yield predictor datasets and the detailed assessment of the water availability timing on the end-of-season crop production during the growing season. Correlation results indicate that over CONUS, at state-level soil moisture and ET indices can provide better information for forecasting corn and soybean yields than vegetation-based indices such as normalized difference vegetation index. The strength of correlation with corn and soybean yields strongly depends on the interannual variability in yield measured at a given location. In this case study, some of the remotely derived datasets examined provide skill comparable to that of in-situ field survey-based data-further demonstrating the utility of these remote sensing-based approaches for estimating crop yield.	4.2
In human-robot interaction scenarios, an intelligent robot should be able to synthesize an appropriate behavior adapted to human profile (i.e., personality). Recent research studies discussed the effect of personality traits on human verbal and nonverbal behaviors. The dynamic characteristics of the generated gestures and postures during the nonverbal communication can differ according to personality traits, which similarly can influence the verbal content of human speech. This research tries to map human verbal behavior to a corresponding verbal and nonverbal combined robot behavior based on the extraversion-introversion personality dimension. We explore the human-robot personality matching aspect and the similarity attraction principle, in addition to the different effects of the adapted combined robot behavior expressed through speech and gestures, and the adapted speech-only robot behavior, on interaction. Experiments with the humanoid NAO robot are reported.	2.3
Increasing habitat connectivity is important for mitigating the effects of climate change, landscape fragmentation and habitat loss for biodiversity conservation. However, modelling connectivity at the relevant scales over which these threats occur has been limited by computational requirements. Here, we introduce the open-source software gflow, which massively parallelizes the computation of circuit theory-based connectivity. The software is developed for high-performance computing, but scales to consumer-grade desktop computers running modern Linux or Mac OS X operating systems. We report high computational efficiency representing a 173x speedup over existing software using high-performance computing and a 84x speedup using a desktop computer while drastically reducing memory requirements. gflow allows large-extent and high-resolution connectivity problems to be calculated over many iterations and at multiple scales. We envision gflow being immediately useful for large-landscape efforts, including climate-driven animal range shifts, multitaxa connectivity, and for the many developing use-cases of circuit theory-based connectivity.	0.4
This paper describes an international facilities design project for Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering students. American and Turkish engineering students collaborated to create and implement the re-design of a Turkish wheelchair manufacturing facility. The company needed engineering assistance to improve the efficiency and increase the capacity of their existing factory. Turkish Industrial Engineering students went on-site to collect data and draw the existing facility layout. American Manufacturing Engineering students analyzed the data and developed new layout designs. Four American students traveled to Turkey between semesters to implement the initial phases of their design. In the second semester, the Turkish students simulated the new layout to see the performance improvements, completing their project. Student learning outcomes were positive for both groups of students. The paper explains critical steps in identifying projects and partners. Lessons are shown about successes and shortcomings in planning, operating, and communicating with design teams across cultures.	3.2
Background: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as deficits in learning, memory and cognition and Alzheimer's disease are associated with diabetes mellitus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor and is known to possess anti-obesity, anti-diabetic actions and is believed to have a role in memory and Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To investigate whether STZ can reduce BDNF production by rat insulinoma (RIN5F) cells in vitro and decrease BDNF levels in the pancreas, liver and brain in vivo. Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5F cells in vitro and type 2 DM in Wistar rats was employed in the present study. Cell viability, activities of various anti-oxidants and secretion of BDNF by RIN5F cells in vitro were measured using MIT assay, biochemical methods and ELISA respectively. In STZ-induced type 2 DM rats: plasma glucose, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and BDNF protein expression in the pancreas, liver and brain tissues were measured. In addition, neuronal count and morphology in the hippocampus and hypothalamus areas was assessed. Results: STZ-induced suppression of RIN5F cell viability was abrogated by BDNF. STZ suppressed BDNF secretion by RIN5F cells in vitro. STZ-induced type 2 DM rats showed hyperglycemia, enhanced plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and reduced plasma and pancreas, liver and brain tissues (P < 0.001) and increased oxidative stress compared to untreated control. Hypothalamic and hippocampal neuron in STZ-treated animals showed a decrease in the number of neurons and morphological changes suggesting of STZ cytotoxicity. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that STZ is not only cytotoxic to pancreatic beta cells but also to hypothalamic and hippocampal neurons by inducing oxidative stress. STZ ability to suppress BDNF production by pancreas, liver and brain tissues suggests that impaired memory, learning, and cognitive dysfunction seen in diabetes mellitus could be due to BDNF deficiency.

Compared to the total water use in livestock production systems, water for livestock drinking is small in amount but is an important requirement for health and productivity of animals. This study was carried out to assess constraints and challenges of meeting drinking water requirements of livestock in rural mixed smallholder crop-livestock farming districts in the Ethiopian Rift Valley area. Data was collected by individual interviews with randomly selected respondents and farmer group discussions. Farmers ranked feed and water scarcity as the two most important constraints for livestock husbandry, although the ranking order differed between districts and villages. Poor quality water was a concern for the communities in proximity to urban settlements or industrial establishments. Water provision for livestock was challenging during the dry season, since alternative water sources dried up or were polluted. Though rainwater harvesting by dugout constructions was practiced to cope with water scarcity, farmers indicated that mismanagement of the harvested water was posing health risks on both livestock and people. A sustainable water provision for livestock in the area, thus, depends on use of different water sources (intermittent or perennial) that should be properly managed. Industrial establishments should adopt an environment-friendly production to minimize pollution of water resources used for livestock consumption. Technical support to farmers is required in proper design and use of existing rainwater harvesting systems. Further investigations are recommended on effect of poor quality water (perceived by farmers) on performance of livestock.	4.3
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been implicated in different aspects of cognition and decision making, including social cognition. Several studies suggest that this region is actually formed by sub-regions concerned with distinct cognitive functions. The ACC is usually divided in its rostro-caudal axis, with the caudal ACC playing a major role in processing own actions, and the rostral ACC being related to social cognition. Recently, it has been suggested that the ACC can also be functionally divided in its dorso-ventral axis into ACC gyrus (ACCg) and ACC sulcus (ACCs), with the ACCg having a central role in processing social information. In this context, we propose that the pregenual ACCg might be especially important for engaging in social interactions. We discuss previous findings that support this hypothesis and present evidence suggesting that the activity of pregenual ACCg neurons is modulated during spontaneous social interactions.	2.1
Lufft's CHM 15k Nimbus ceilometer and a collocated Cimel sunphotometer were used, in tandem with satellite data, to observe the transport of atmospheric aerosols over Raciborz, Poland, during an exceptionally warm month of August 2015. Two distinct periods are identified: increased aerosol optical thickness (AOT) values, exceeding 0.65, during August 6 to 13 concurrent with the planetary boundary layer elevated up to similar to 2.5 km and thin aerosol layers up to 7 km above ground visible from August 25 to 27. A newly developed scheme for backward air mass trajectory analysis is employed. The scheme utilizes satellite data on thermal anomalies as well as multiangle imaging of aerosol clouds. The obtained retrievals provide evidence that aerosols of biomass burning type were present during the first period, originating from a strong episode of wildfires in Ukraine. Moreover, satellite AOT data from the MODIS instrument show that a significant part of the observed aerosol was accumulated during transport between the region of intense biomass burning and the receptor, Raciborz. The same analysis scheme suggests that a long-range transport of biomass burning products from the United States was a source of the layers observed during the second period. (C) The Authors.

Objectives Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and heritable psychiatric disorder. However, genetic studies in SAD are rare and only a few candidate genes have been implicated so far. In the present study, we investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with other psychiatric disorders also contribute toward the development of SAD and followed up variants associated with SAD on the phenotypic level. Patients and methods We genotyped a total of 24 SNPs in a German sample of 321 SAD patients and 804 controls. We carried out single-marker analyses as well as quantitative association analyses of SAD severity and harm avoidance. Results None of the variants investigated showed an association with SAD in our case-control sample after Bonferroni correction. Two SNPs reached nominal significance (rs818702, P=0.032; rs140701, P=0.048). Of these, only rs140701 showed an association in the same allelic direction as reported previously. This SNP is located within the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4, which is the primary target of selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors used for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. The quantitative association analysis of all cases with available data on symptom severity showed four SNPs with a nominal significant association. Among these SNPs, rs10994359 showed the strongest association (P=0.001) and was located near the ANK3 gene. In addition, rs10994359 was nominally associated with harm avoidance scores (P=0.001). Conclusion Our results provide further evidence for an involvement of the serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4 in the etiology of anxiety-related traits. Furthermore, our study implicates that genetic variation at the genome-wide associated bipolar disorder locus ANK3 might influence anxiety-related personality traits.

Manning's empirical formula in conjunction with Strickler's scaling is widely used to predict the hulk velocity V from the hydraulic radius Rh, the roughness size r and the slope of the energy grade line S in uniform channel and pipe flows at high bulk Reynolds numbers. Despite their importance in science and engineering, both Manning's and Strickler's formulations have waited for decades before finding a theoretical explanation. This was provided, for the first time, by Gioia & Bombardelli (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 88, 2002. 014501), labelled as GB02, using phenomenological arguments. Perhaps their most remarkable finding was the link between the Strickler and the Kolmogorov scaling exponents, the latter pertaining to velocity fluctuations in the inertial subrange of the turbulence spectrum and presumed to he universal. In this work, the GB02 analysis is first revisited, showing that GB02 employed several ad hoc scaling assumptions for the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and, although implicitly, for the mean velocity gradient adjacent to the roughness elements. The similarity constants arising from the GB02 scaling assumptions were presumed to he independent of r/R-h, which is inconsistent with well-known flow properties in the near-wall region of turbulent wall flows. Because of the dependence of these similarity constants on r/R-h, this existing theory requires the validity of the Strickler scaling to cancel the dependence of these constants on rIRh so as to arrive at the Strickler scaling and Manning's formula. Here, the GB02 approach is corroborated using a co-spectral budget (CSB) model for the wall shear stress formulated at the cross-over between the roughness sublayer and the log region. Assuming a simplified shape for the spectrum of the vertical velocity w, the proposed CSB model (subject to another simplifying assumption that production is balanced by pressure velocity interaction) allows Manning's formula to be derived. To substantiate this approach, numerical solutions to the CSB over the entire flow depth using different spectral shapes for w are carried out for a wide range of r/R-h. the results from this analysis support the simplifying hypotheses used to derive Manning's equation. The derived equation provides a formulation for n that agrees with reported values in the literature over seven decades of r variations. While none of the investigated spectral shapes allows the recovery of the Strickler scaling, the numerical solutions of the CSB reproduce the Nikuradse data in the fully rough regime, thereby confirming that the Strickler scaling represents only an approximate fit for the friction factor for granular roughness.	3.1
Few research-developed early intervention models have been deployed to and tested in real world preschool programs. In this study, teaching staff implemented a social communication modularized intervention, JASPER, in their daily program. Sixty-six preschool children with autism in twelve classrooms (12 teachers) were randomized to receive immediate JASPER training (IT) or were waitlisted (WL) for 3 months with a 1-month follow up. Measures of core deficits (initiations of joint engagement, joint attention gestures and language, play skills) and standardized cognitive measures were improved for IT over WL children. IT teachers achieved and maintained high fidelity. Teachers can implement evidence-based interventions with significant improvements in core deficits of their children with ASD.	2.3
This paper presents the results of load tests conducted in the laboratory on an embedded model strip footing resting on a reinforced dense sand bed. The reinforcement used was woven geotextile with wraparound ends, as well as without wraparound ends for investigating the benefits of providing wraparounds. The number of reinforcement layers varied from 1 to 5. The ratio of embedment depth of the footing to its width, called the embedment depth ratio, varied from 0 to 1. The effect of utilizing the wraparound ends with the reinforcement on the load-bearing capacity of the reinforced sand bed has been of special interest in this study. The experimental results arising from the study are compared with the numerical findings based on the finite-element analysis (FEA) carried out using the PLAXIS 2D software. The study shows a significant improvement in both the load-bearing capacity and the stiffness of the sand bed with increasing number of reinforcement layers, as well as with the provision of wraparound ends of the reinforcement. The numerical results follow the experimental results closely for lower settlement values. The graphical presentations of the results of our experimentation can be used as preliminary design guidelines for field applications with conditions similar to those considered in the present study. However, the results presented in this paper may require modifications suitably to account for the difference in the scale of laboratory and the field conditions while using them for practical applications.	4.1
p53 was reported to be an attractive immunotherapy target because it is mutated in approximately half of human cancers, resulting in its inactivation and often accumulation in tumor cells. Peptides derived from p53 are presented by class I MHC molecules and may act as tumor-associated epitopes which could be targeted by p53-specific T cells. Interestingly, it was recently shown that there is a lack of significant correlation between p53 expression levels in tumors and their recognition by p53-TCR transduced T cells. To better understand the influence of the mutational status of p53 on its presentation by the MHC system and on T cell antitumor reactivity, we generated several mutant p53 constructs and expressed them in HLA-A2(+)/p53(-) cells. Upon co-culture with p53-specific T cells, we measured the specific recognition of p53-expressing target cells by means of cytokine secretion, marker upregulation and cytotoxicity, and in parallel determined p53 expression levels by intracellular staining. We also examined the relevance of antigen presentation components on p53 recognition and the impact of mutant p53 expression on cell-cycle dynamics. Our results show that selected p53 mutations altering protein stability can modulate p53 presentation to T cells, leading to a differential immune reactivity inversely correlated with measured p53 protein levels. Thus, p53 may behave differently than other classical tumor antigens and its mutational status should therefore be taken into account when elaborating immunotherapy treatments of cancer patients targeting p53.	6.3
An important prerequisite for prospective competitive factories is an enduring development of production-related competencies in today's universities for manufacturing engineering. Learning Factories are an action-oriented approach for developing these competencies. They are highly authentic learning environments in which genuine products are manufactured in a simulated but life-like production setting. The study aims at investigating the learning success of engineering students in a Learning Factory. Results of a conducted experiment are presented and discussed giving proof to the hypotheses that students in a Learning Factory. Results of a conducted experiment are presented and discussed giving proof to the hypotheses that students have a greater application-performance and a higher degree of action-substantiating knowledge after having attended an action-oriented learning event within the Learning Factory that after receiving a conventional treatment.

This paper presents a very simple and efficient encryption scheme based on controlled chaotic maps and ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) coding, in order to secure the real-time voice communication for operating at 16, 24, 32 or 40 kbps. This encryption algorithm adopts three main operations one to generate chaotic values using two chaotic logistic maps starting from independent initial conditions, the second to transform them into binary words using random encoding tables and the third to execute some basic operations and substitutions. It has important properties of randomness that can pass NIST batteries of tests. The evaluation and simulation analysis indicate that our proposal possesses an excellent statistical and cryptographic properties; it provides low correlation between adjacent samples in encryption speech, extremely sensitive encryption keys and has a large key space which is sufficient to protect against brute-force attack. As an illustrative example, an application on a commonly-encoder type used in communications, standard ITU-T G. 726, is presented.	0.3
The next generation Internet (also known as Internet-of-Things - IoT), will ubiquitously integrate trillions of computing devices of all kinds, shapes and sizes. For this ubiquity to materialize, a key aspect will certainly be interoperability, the capability of different technologies (e.g. different communication protocols at both horizontal and vertical levels, different hardware platforms, different operating systems, fixed and mobile nodes, etc) to talk to and understand each other. A major enabler for this interoperability is the use of standard and commercial-off-the-shelf technologies (e.g. communication protocols, hardware platforms, operating systems). As IPv6 has become the de-facto communication technology for the Internet, 6LoWPAN has recently started paving the way for extending the Internet to low-power low-cost wireless devices. However, while mobility support will be a requirement (or at least beneficial) in many applications contexts, the support of mobile nodes in the default 6loWPAN/RPL protocol leads to excessive packet loss and delays. In this work, we show that interoperability between fixed and mobile nodes can be successfully achieved through the use of appropriate hand-off and topology management techniques. We propose a mobility management framework (dubbed mRPL+) unifying two hand-off models: (1) hard hand-off, where a mobile node has to break a link before finding a new link, and (2) soft hand-off, where a mobile node selects the new link before disconnecting from the current one. Importantly, mRPL+ is integrated in the 6LoWPAN/RPL stack in a backward compatible manner. Simulation results indicate that in a network with mobile nodes, packet delivery ratio with mRPL+ is nearly 100%, where RPL achieves 80% in best case. Hand-off process has a disconnected period of few milliseconds (hand-off delay = 4 ms), while RPL experiences few seconds of disconnection during node's mobility (3 - 10 s). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human health due to its antioxidant capabilities. The Se content around the world is highly variable from 0.005 mg kg(-1) in areas from China and Finland to 8,000 mg kg-1 in seleniferous soils from Tuva-Russia. However, about one billion of people in the world wide are Se deficient. During the last decade, studies related with strategies for Se biofortification in food plants for human nutrition have significantly increased because this metalloid is incorporated into human metabolism mainly as a constituent of food plants. Similarly, Se biofortification is important in pastures for increasing the Se content in cattle to enrich meat and to prevent disease associated to Se deficiency as white muscle disease. In China, two endemic diseases have been related to Se deficiency: Keshan and Keshin-Beck diseases. Agronomic biofortification by using inorganic Se sources is a current practice in countries as China, Finland, and USA. In Chile, fertilization by using chemical compounds with Se is an uncommon practice due the edaphoclimatic characteristics of Andisols, which represent around 60% of agricultural soils of southern Chile. Recent studies showed that microorganisms as bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in the transformations and Se availability, representing an interesting biotechnological alternative to Se biofortification. This review is focalized to describing Se behavior in soil-plant system and the possible strategies to improving Se content, including the use of microorganisms as biotechnological tools for increasing plant nutrition and quality. Specific attention will be devoted to volcanic soils of Southern Chile, where different factors concur to enhance the Se-deficiency problem.	6.2
Our Smart City contribution is transportation-oriented in that it proposes a dynamic road lane management system in order to share appropriately the space devoted to traffic. After a historical view of a series of solutions from physical to ICT supported, we present our proposal extensively supported by up-to-date ICT. Following a main presentation, we describe the system architecture and its working conditions. Then, we present the proposed simulator designed to study operating and driver's conditions with respect to the new traffic signs proposed. We also describe a Mock-up technology validation and give preliminary information on in-the-field deployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.0
Experiments in assisted living confirm that such systems can provide context-aware services that enable occupants to remain active and independent. They also demonstrate that abnormal sensor events hamper the correct identification of critical (and potentially life-threatening) situations, and that existing learning, estimation, and time-based approaches are inaccurate and inflexible when applied to multiple people sharing a living space. We propose a technique that integrates the semantics of sensor readings with statistical outlier detection. We evaluate the technique against four real-world datasets that include multiple individuals, and show consistent rates of anomaly detection across different environments.	4.0
Building detection from two-dimensional highresolution satellite images is a computer vision, photogrammetry, and remote sensing task that has arisen in the last decades with the advances in sensors technology and can be utilized in several applications that require the creation of urban maps or the study of urban changes. However, the variety of irrelevant objects that appear in an urban environment and resemble buildings, and the significant variations in the shape and generally the appearance of buildings render building detection a quite demanding task. As a result, automated methods that can robustly detect buildings in satellite images are necessary. To this end, we propose a building detection method that consists of two modules. The first module is a feature detector that extracts histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) from image regions. Using a novel approach, a support vector machine classifier is trained with the introduction of a special denoising distancemeasure for the computation of distances between HOG-LBP descriptors before their classification to the building or nonbuilding class. The second module consists of a set of region refinement processes that employs the output of the HOG-LBP detector in the form of detected rectangular image regions. Image segmentation is performed and a novel building recognition methodology is proposed to accurately identify building regions, while simultaneously discard false detections of the first module of the proposed method. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology can robustly detect buildings from satellite images and outperforms state-of-the-art building detection methods.	0.0
The fast aging of the population around the world makes ambient intelligence-based assistive technologies essential for sustainable and efficient health-care systems. Aging adults who decide to live alone at home need constant monitoring to control their health status and quality of life. This work introduces a new wearable device that continuously monitors the emotional state of the elderly. Electro-dermal activity (EDA) is used to classify the aging adults into two groups: sleepiness and stressed. The results report a performance of more than 83% of accuracy by using exclusively time and magnitude features from EDA events. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.0
Background:Horizontal advancement genioplasty can be extremely rewarding for microgenia. However, it is challenging for even very experienced surgeon to determine the three-dimensional position of the distant bone fragment during the operation. This study aimed to apply and evaluate computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing techniques for horizontal advancement genioplasty to improve surgical accuracy.Methods:Seven patients with microgenia were prospectively enrolled in the study. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT), photographs, and lateral cephalograms were performed. Computer-aided design was done based on preoperative CT data, and then surgical templates (cutting guide templates and fixation templates) were designed accordingly to guide horizontal advancement genioplasty. All surgeries were performed by junior surgeons. The accuracy of the authors' method was evaluated by the relative error (the mean value of discrepancy between postoperative CT and preoperative design at 6 points selected randomly/preoperative design movement x 100%), Pg position error (postoperative Pg Advancement - preoperative CAD Pg Advancement)/preoperative CAD Pg Advancement x 100%), and Me position error (postoperative Me downward movement - preoperative CAD Me downward movement)/preoperative CAD Me downward movement x 100%). They are all calculated by Geomagic automatically.Results:All 7 patients were satisfied with their aesthetic outcomes. The average absolute relative error is 1.8%. The average absolute Pg position error is 1.9% and the average absolute Me position error value is 1.3%.Conclusions:The authors' study showed that applying computer-assisted techniques for horizontal advancement genioplasty provided accurate surgical result. With this technique, best result for horizontal advancement genioplasty could be achieved by even inexperienced surgeons.	3.0
Introduction: It is unknown if risk loci, identified by genome-wide association studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), are linked to common molecular mechanisms through epistatic effects. Methods: We performed genome-wide interaction studies of five risk variants for LOAD followed by enrichment analyses to find if there are pathways that simultaneously interact with more than one variant. This novel approach was applied to four independent cohorts (5393 cases and 3746 controls). Results: We found enrichment of epistasis in gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling with risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms in APOE and MS4A6A (P value = 3.7 x 10(-5), P value = 5.6 x 10(-6)); vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway was also enriched in epistasis with these loci (P value = 9.6 x 10(-5), P value = 2.4 x 10(-7)). MS4A6A risk variant also interacted with dilated cardiomyopathy pathway (P value = 3.1 x 10(-7)). Discussion: In addition to APOE, MS4A6A polymorphisms should be considered in hormone trials targeting gonadotropins. Interactions of risk variants with neurovascular pathways may also be important in LOAD pathology. (C) 2016 the Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
Expansive soils are one of the most problematic materials that are widely encountered in significant land areas in several parts of the world; like Africa, Australia, India, United States and Canada. The South Gujarat region in India have majority of top soil as black cotton soil. The black cotton soil has characteristics of shrinking on drying and heaving on wetting. This soil being expansive creates several types of damages to pavement structures, and in some cases the pavement may even become unserviceable. The normal climate condition of study area shows short wet and long dry period which aggravate the problem of swelling and shrinkage. The IRC: 37 - 2001, Annexure - 4 suggest 0.6 to 1.0 m thick non-cohesive soil cushion on the expansive soil for road construction which led to higher cost for road construction. Also for new urban areas it is difficult to raise the embankment or to excavate the subgrade upto such a depth due to existing structures and under laying service lines. To provide economical solution along with feasible application two innovative materials were used namely, CONSOLID and Geotextile for flexible pavement. The CONSOLID application shows the great improvement of CBR values helping the overall stability of the pavement. The Geotextile provided below the pavement components to act against the heaving of the swelling soil at the same time it helps as drainage layer also. Field study is undertaken to observe the effect of Geotextile in flexible pavement performance and 2 specific boundary conditions are created for observations. The Observations shows about 50 % reduction in shrinkage effect for paved road reinforced with Geotextile subjected to drying and wetting cycles. Both the materials are having its unique advantage in the performance improvement of flexible pavement over expansive subgrade.	4.1
The equations of compressible ideal fluids analogous to those of electromagnetism are reformulated in terms of hyperbolic octonions. Furthermore, the wave equations with source terms are generalized in a compact and elegant form. The analogy between fluid mechanics and electromagnetism is also argued by considering the previous octonionic formulations in relevant literature.	3.4
Gamification aims to implement game features in non-game contexts, with the goal of increasing the motivation of individuals performing a specific task or set of tasks. The tasks themselves, can focus on cognitive behavior change (e.g., overcoming anxiety) or physical behavior change (e.g., overcoming a shoulder injury). Current gamification methods primarily serve as guidelines and principles for the design of gamified applications. Moreover, these methods often overlook the complexity of actually implementing the game features and do not consider the effects that game features have on individuals' ability to perform a target task. A knowledge gap exists in understanding the tradeoffs between the complexity of implementing a game feature and the impact it has on increasing individuals' motivation and performance on a particular task or set of tasks. This paper presents a method for evaluating the complexity of implementing game features and the physical effort required to perform the tasks of the application, with a specific focus on physically-interactive gamified applications. Designers will gain a fundamental understanding of how the implementation of specific game features, contributes toward the objective of the application. A case study is presented that focuses on physically-interactive gamified applications in a virtual environment. Empirical results measuring the effects of game features on participants' performance are presented, which provide evidence in support of the metrics proposed in this study. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers on how to manage their resources more efficiently and predict possible design issues (e.g., not meeting the objective of the application) while creating gamification applications.

General English Four-skills courses are usually intended to help learners achieve a satisfactory level of language proficiency by focusing on speaking, listening, reading and writing skills. However, the extent to which students who attend this kind of courses are being well prepared to communicate satisfactorily in real contexts seems not to be effective enough. It appears little if no attention is usually paid to aspects of non-verbal communication in English as a complement of spoken language and as a must to avoid future cross-cultural misunderstandings. In contrast to non-verbal communication, verbal communication commonly takes priority in general English four-skills courses. This paper is aimed at discussing the importance and implications of incorporating the teaching of non-verbal communication in these kinds of courses for Mexican Spanish speakers so as to raise learners' awareness of non-verbal communication issues and prepare them for more natural and effective communication. In order to carry out a well informed discussion on this issue, the nature and main characteristics of non-verbal communication as well as its significance and current role in EFL (English Foreign Language) learning will be first established. Secondly, a specific comparison of common patterns of non-verbal behavior of Mexican Spanish speakers, American and British English speakers will take place so as to decide on the non-verbal contents a general English four-skills course may comprise. Thirdly, a suggested teaching approach, methodology, activities, materials and the teacher's role in teaching non-verbal cues will be stated. Finally, the implications of teaching nonverbal communication issues in general English four-skills courses for Mexican Spanish speakers and the general conclusions on this discussion will be annotated.	2.3
Sustainable water management is crucial in the reduction of water pollution and floods. New techniques should be investigated in order to avoid present and future problems such as flood, drought, and water contamination. For this purpose, Low Impact Development-Best Management Practice (LID-BMP) has recently come into the stage in storm water management. Vegetative swales, green roofs, bioretentions, storm water wetlands, rain barrels, permeable asphalts and pavements are among LID-BMPs. Bioretention type of LID is implemented to diminish adverse effects of urbanization such as flood by reducing peak flows on surface and thus managing storm water runoff. The aim of this study is to investigate the hydrological performance of bioretentions by developing a hydrological model based on the data obtained using experimental setup called Rainfall-Watershed-Bioretention (RWB). The hydrological model of RWB (HM-RWB) consists of two main components: (i) rainfall-runoff model in which kinematic wave theory is used for simulation of surface runoff generated over the drainage area that reaches the bioretention as inflow; (ii) runoff-bioretention flow model in which Green-Ampt method under unsteady rainfall is employed and further improved by incorporating the effect of ponding depth on bioretention for the simulation of outflow at the exit of the bioretention. It is observed that the results of the hydrological model developed herein are in good agreement with the measured data obtained in the RWB experimental setup.	4.4
Analysis and detection of human behaviors from video sequences has became recently a very hot research topic in computer vision and artificial intelligence. Indeed, human behavior understanding plays a fundamental role in several innovative application domains such as smart video surveillance, ambient intelligence and content-based video information retrieval. However, the uncertainty and vagueness that typically characterize human daily activities make frameworks for human behavior analysis (HBA) hard to design and develop. In order to bridge this gap, this paper proposes a hierarchical architecture, based on a tracking algorithm, time-delay neural networks and fuzzy inference systems, aimed at improving the performance of current MBA systems in terms of scalability, robustness and effectiveness in behavior detection. Precisely, the joint use of the aforementioned methodologies enables both a quantitative and qualitative behavioral analysis that efficiently face the intrinsic people/objects tracking imprecision and provide context aware and semantic capabilities for better identifying a given activity. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed framework have been verified by using the well-known CAVIAR dataset and comparing our system's performance with other similar approaches working on the same dataset.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is widely used to characterize the charge carrier transfer and charge storage process. Charge carrier transfer process may be affected by the media viscosity. Here, EIS was used to monitor the curing processes of epoxy/amine blends for the first attempt, and a new equation was proposed to character the curing process and estimate the curing degree of resins, while, resins, curing agents and the curing processes have significant effect on product properties. Monitoring curing processes of certain resin/curing agent system is very helpful to design an appropriate formulation. The epoxy/amine blends, the model system, were prepared with Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A as epoxy resin and different ratio of phenalkamine modified with cardanol as curing agent. The curing processes of epoxy/amine were also investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which was employed as a comparative method to verify the EIS results. A good agreement is obtained between the two methods, especially under higher curing temperature condition, which demonstrates the great promise to monitor the curing processes using EIS. The EIS results were also modeled to equivalent electrical circuits.(EEC) by Z(simple)Win software for the further analysis. These results might provide some insights on optimizing the epoxy/amine ratio and the performance of cured epoxy resin and monitoring some process related to viscosity change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Purpose of Review The goal of this review is to characterize food allergy management and anaphylaxis in schools and assess current policies and level of preparedness of schools to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. Recent Findings An increasing number of school-aged children have food allergies, and studies show that a significant number of school children with no known history of allergies will experience their first anaphylactic reaction at school. Stock-unassigned epinephrine auto-injectors are recommended in schools but not mandatory in most states, and therefore, epinephrine is not always available. Non-nursing staff members are sometimes administering epinephrine due to limitations in nurse staffing. Summary Wide variations in staff training and lack of stock epinephrine leave many schools inadequately prepared to manage anaphylactic reactions. Emphasis should be placed not only on ensuring all schools have stock epinephrine but also on training a wider range of school staff members to minimize treatment delay with epinephrine and improve clinical outcomes.	5.1
Rainwater harvesting could increase the resilience of ecosystems on the Loess Plateau and thus ensure the sustainability of livelihoods that depend on them. As such, it is a key component of strategies for adapting to global climate change. In this study, we used a new method to quantify the rainwater harvesting potential (RWHP) across the whole Loess Plateau and to characterize its spatial and temporal variation over the last four decades on the basis of the variable infiltration capacity model. It was found that that the mean RWHP of the study region was 731.10x10(8)m(3), and the average water layer thickness was 114.34mm. There is considerable scope for rainwater harvesting across the Loess Plateau as a whole, to the extent that it could potentially provide enough water to implement the Grain for Green' Project. The annual average RWHP decreased slightly from 1971 to 2010, and Hurst exponent analysis indicated that this trend will exhibit long-term persistence. The annual RWHP was highest in the southeast of the Loess Plateau and lowest in the northwest. Areas with high RWHP values tended to be clustered around the middle reach of the Yellow River. For most areas, there was no significant change between 1971 and 2010. Those areas for which there was a significant decrease in RWHP were primarily located around the upper-middle reaches of the Weihe River, the upper reach of Jinghe River, the eastern Guanzhong Plain, the Qinhe River watershed and the area around Dongsheng. Quantitative assessments of RWHP are likely to be useful for guiding the development and use of innovative rainwater harvesting technologies around the world and could help to relieve the problems caused by water shortages on the Loess Plateau while simultaneously eliminate the major cause of soil erosion.

Identifying network traffics at their early stages accurately is very important for network management and security. Recent years, more and more studies have devoted to find effective machine learning models to identify traffics with few packets at the early stage. In this paper, we try to build an effective early stage traffic identification model by applying flexible neural trees (FNT). Three network traffic data sets including two open data sets are used for the study. We first extract both packet-level features and statistical features from the first six continuous packets and six noncontinuous packets of each flow. Packet sizes are applied as packet-level features. And for statistical features, average, standard deviation, maximum and minimum are selected. Eight classical classifiers are employed as the comparing methods in the identification experiments. Accuracy, true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are applied to evaluate the performances of the compared methods. FNT outperforms the other methods for most cases in the identification experiments, and it behaves very well for both TPR and FPR. Furthermore, it can show the selected features in the optimal tree result. Experiment result shows that FNT is effective for early stage traffic identification.	0.1
Background: There is a dearth of research in the published literature on substance use and addiction in the Middle East and Islamic countries. This study was the first to explore whether the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction was relevant to an addicted treatment population in Jordan, an Islamic country. Methods: A qualitative study design using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a sample of 25 males in addiction treatment. The sample was drawn from a cohort of in-patients at a treatment centre in Amman, Jordan who had already participated in a quantitative survey. A purposive sample was selected to ensure the inclusion of a range of characteristics that might affect their experience of developing addiction and its consequences, i.e., age, marital status and educational level. Interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis conducted using verbatim quotes to illustrate themes. Themes were mapped onto the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of addiction. Results: This study found addiction was associated with a range of health (physical and psychological), social and spiritual factors. Unpleasant physical withdrawal effects, psychological symptoms, such as anxiety and suicide attempts, were experienced. There was breakdown in marital and family relations, loss of employment, involvement in crime and neglect of religious practices, resulting in social isolation. Conclusion: This study found that, despite some differences in emphasis, the biopsychosocial, spiritual model of addiction fit well particularly given the relative importance of religion in Islamic culture. Spirituality was not explored and further study of spirituality versus religious practice in this culture is recommended. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.	5.0
1. Individual plant genotypes as well as genotypic diversity can shape the structure and function of ecosystems; however, the abiotic environment may modify these genotypic influences on ecosystem-level responses. 2. To explore how the interactions between plant genotype, genotypic diversity and soil nutrient availability affect the structure and function of a temperate grassland ecosystem, we manipulated the genotypic diversity of a common perennial herbaceous plant, Solidago altissima (single genotype monoculture and diversity plots) and soil nutrient availability (+nitrogen, +phosphorus, +nitrogen and +phosphorus, unmanipulated control) in a common garden setting. We tracked temporal changes in ecosystem structure (e.g. leaf area index and net primary productivity) as well as a variety of ecosystem functions (e.g. net ecosystem carbon and water exchange and soil carbon efflux) over a growing season. 3. We found that variation in plant genotype identity consistently shaped ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) while it inconsistently altered several ecosystem functions across time. For instance, variation in plant genotype identity influenced net ecosystem carbon dynamics early in the growing season while it influenced water dynamics later in the growing season. The strength of the relationship between genotypic diversity and ecosystem function declined over the season and the relationship between ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) and function (net ecosystem carbon and water exchange) varied across treatments. Overall, there was a strong correlation between ecosystem structure and function across monoculture genotype plots but a weak relationship between ecosystem structure and function across mixed genotype plots. Surprisingly, soil nutrients did not influence ecosystem structure and had minimal impacts on carbon and water flux. 4. Our data suggest that plant genetic variation, and to some extent plant genotypic diversity, strongly influence ecosystem structure and function in an old-field ecosystem, but nutrient availability did not directly or interactively influence ecosystem structure or function.	6.4
Users are currently expected to benefit from the concurrent use of different computing devices and applications: Personal computers for an easier content production, mobile devices for increased mobility and context-awareness, wearable devices for more transparent health-related data acquisitions, etc. However, the simultaneous use of different devices and applications could be perceived as disruptive or unproductive, due to the need of additional settings, lack of integration, etc. As a first step to overcome this problem, in this paper we introduce the notion of Continuous Interaction (CoIn) systems. These systems intend to promote the simultaneous use of multiple devices and applications to complete tasks in a more effective, flexible and easy way. To achieve that goal, a set of human-centred design principles have been figured out to enable users to seamlessly share tasks across multiple devices, independently of the software applications supporting their completion. The case study of a Mobile Forensic Workspace (MFW) will be presented to highlight the benefits that CoIn systems could bring to the Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Ubiquitous Computing research fields.	4.0
The increasing limitations on available energy require use of new environmentally friendly resources and enhancement of utilization efficiency of available resources. Energy storage systems (ESSs) are a promising technology to realize such a goal; however, their application in networks requires an investment that must be economically justified. This study examined the effect of ESS use on energy generation costs in networks for a specific time period. This includes determining the best location for installation of the ESS and the best possible operation schedules for the ESS and power plants to achieve the greatest decrease in daily energy generation costs. The influences of all the factors affecting the final solution were studied under different scenarios. The effects of power plant cost functions, transmission line capacity, and network upgrades were compared. All scenarios were implemented in an IEEE standard 30-bus network. The best possible specifications of ESS can reduce daily energy generation cost by 3% for selected power plant cost functions. It was found that the use of ESS in a network uniformed stress on the transmission line and, in such a case, it would be possible to defer the network upgrade for 21 years.	1.0
Considering the major requirements for automotive applications i.e., high torque and power density, low torque ripple, wide speed range, and high speed operation capability, the synchronous reluctance machine is still under intensive investigation. As a traction motor, the proper operation of the SynRM at low and high speeds is desired, the magnetic and mechanical performance of the core structure are important challenges. Therefore, prior to the final design, these need to be analyzed with regards to the core magnetic behavior and mechanical robustness which cause degradation in torque quality and harmful deformation at critical points in the rotor structure. At low speed, the high current demand at maximum torque makes the core magnetic performance dominant, whereas at high speed the mechanical behavior of the rotor core structure limits the machine performance. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different core characteristics to improve the core magnetic and mechanical performance of the SynRM equipped with a transversal laminated anisotropic rotor type for automotive applications.	3.3
This work focuses on the review of particle-based multiscale and hybrid methods that have surfaced in the field of fluid mechanics over the last 20 years. We consider five established particle methods: molecular dynamics, direct simulation Monte Carlo, lattice Boltzmann method, dissipative particle dynamics and smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. A general description is given on each particle method in conjunction with multiscale and hybrid applications. An analysis on the length scale separation revealed that current multiscale methods only bridge across scales which are of the order of O(10(2))-O(10(3)) and that further work on complex geometries and parallel code optimisation is needed to increase the separation. Similarities between methods are highlighted and combinations discussed. Advantages, disadvantages and applications of each particle method have been tabulated as a reference.	3.4
In this letter, we propose a change detection method based on Gabor wavelet features for very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, Gabor wavelet features are extracted from two temporal VHR images to obtain spatial and contextual information. Then, the Gabor-waveletbased difference measure (GWDM) is designed to generate the difference image. In GWDM, a new local similarity measure is defined, in which the Markov random field neighborhood system is incorporated to obtain a local relationship, and the coefficient of variation method is applied to discriminate contributions from different features. Finally, the fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm is employed to obtain the final change map. Experiments employing QuickBird and SPOT5 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	4.2
In the present paper, we investigate the stationary probability distribution(SPD) and the mean treatment time of a time-delayed cancer growth system induced by cross-correlated intrinsic and extrinsic noises. Our main results show that the resonant-like phenomenon of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) appears in the tumor cell growth model due to the interaction of all kinds of noises and time delay. Due to the existence of the resonant-like peak value, by increasing the intensity of multiplicative noise and time delay, it is possible to restrain effectively the development of the cancer cells and enhance the stability of the system. During the process of controlling the diffusion of the tumor cells, it contributes to inhibiting the development of cancer by increasing the cross-correlated noise strength and weakening the additive noise intensity and time delay. Meanwhile, the proper multiplicative noise intensity is conducive to the process of inhibition. Conversely, in the process of exterminating cancer cells of a large density, it can exert positive effects on eliminating the tumor cells by increasing noises intensities and the value of time delay.

The importance of names has been demonstrated for decision making related to individuals as well as companies. While previous researchers have focused on traits such as the fluency of names, we present three studies that focus on the role of the hard e or [A] sound in relation to helping behavior. Because pronunciation of the [A] sound requires a facial movement that mimics a smile particularly when the sound occurs at the end of a name, our research complements previous findings generated by the theory of embodied cognition in which biting on a pencil or chopstick evoked behavioral and mood changes. Study 1 finds that participants are more likely to help someone whose name ends with the [A] sound while study 2 utilizes a broader set of contrasting sounds and finds a basic preference for the [A] sound that is specific to women. Study 3 shows that women are significantly more likely to recall addressing their parents as Mommy or Daddy when soliciting help rather than Mom or Dad. Our findings complement previous research concerning motherese and highlight a phonetic cue for prosocial behavior that appears to offer insights for marketing and management. Just as the current studies are important in understanding interpersonal interactions, the findings have direct relevance for marketing campaigns that focus on consumer engagement.	2.4
This paper describes the second part of a series of investigation to develop algorithms for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol parameters and surface reflectance from the future hyperspectral and geostationary satellite sensors such as Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO). The information content in these hyperspectral measurements is analyzed for 6 principal components (PCs) of surface spectra and a total of 14 aerosol parameters that describe the columnar aerosol volume V-total fine-mode aerosol volume fraction, and the size distribution and wavelength-dependent index of refraction in both coarse and fine mode aerosols. Forward simulations of atmospheric radiative transfer are conducted for 5 surface types (green vegetation, bare soil, rangeland, concrete and mixed surface case) and a wide range of aerosol mixtures. It is shown that the PCs of surface spectra in the atmospheric window channel could be derived from the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance in the conditions of low aerosol optical depth (AOD <= 0.2 at 550 nm), with a relative error of 1%. With degree freedom for signal analysis and the sequential forward selection method, the common bands for different aerosol mixture types and surface types can be selected for aerosol retrieval. The first 20% of our selected bands accounts for more than 90% of information content for aerosols, and only 4 PCs are needed to reconstruct surface reflectance. However, the information content in these common bands from each TEMPO individual observation is insufficient for the simultaneous retrieval of surface's PC weight coefficients and multiple aerosol parameters (other than V-total). In contrast, with multiple observations for the same location from TEMPO in multiple consecutive days, 1-3 additional aerosol parameters could be retrieved. Consequently, a self adjustable aerosol retrieval algorithm to account for surface types, AOD conditions, and multiple-consecutive observations is recommended to derive aerosol parameters and surface reflectance simultaneously from TEMPO. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to endorsing the content of stigmatizing thoughts (self-stigma content), how frequently and automatically individuals think about these thoughts (self-stigma process) also have implications for their well-being. The present study examined the roles of self-compassion and mindfulness in moderating the relationships of self-stigma content and process with subjective well-being of people in recovery of mental illness (PMI) and people living with HIV (PLHIV). Participants included 169 PMI and 291 PLHIV in Hong Kong who reported their levels of self-compassion, mindfulness, self-stigma content and process, and life satisfaction. Path analyses indicated that the proposed model fitted the two samples well, chi(2) (10) = 19, p = .04, CFI = .98, NNFI = .93, and RMSEA = .04. In both groups, self-compassion and mindfulness were significantly associated with life satisfaction. Self-compassion moderated the relationship between self-stigma content and life satisfaction among PLHIV, while mindfulness moderated the relationship between self-stigma process and life satisfaction among PMI. The differential moderating roles of self-compassion and mindfulness in buffering the effects of self-stigma content and process among PMI and PLHIV were identified, and implications for stigma reduction and well-being promotion in different stigmatized groups were discussed.	5.4
This paper presents an ambient intelligence system designed for assisted living. The system processes the audio and video data acquired from multiple sensors spread in the environment to automatically detect dangerous events and generate automatic warning messages. The paper presents the distributed perception infrastructure that has been implemented by means of an open-source software middleware called NMM. Different processing nodes have been developed which can cooperate to extract high level information about the environment. Examples of implemented nodes running algorithms for people detection or face recognition are presented. Experiments on novel algorithms for people fall detection and sound classification and localization are discussed. Eventually, we present successful experiments in two test bed scenarios.

People use impressions of an evaluative target's self-esteem to infer their possession of socially desirable traits. But will people still use this self-esteem proxy when trait-relevant diagnostic information is available? We test this possibility in two experiments: participants learn that a target person has low or high self-esteem, and then receive diagnostic information about the target's academic success or failure and positive or negative affectivity (Study 1), or watch a video of the target's extraverted or introverted behavior (Study 2). In both experiments, participants' impressions of the target's traits accurately tracked diagnostic information, but impressions also revealed an independent self-esteem proxy effect. Evidently, the self-esteem proxy is robust and influences person perception even in the presence of vivid individuating information.	2.2
The invasive computing paradigm offers applications the possibility to dynamically spread their computation in a multicore/multiprocessor system in a resource-aware way. If applications are assumed to act maliciously, many security problems arise. In this acticle, we discuss different ways to deal with security problems in a resource-aware way. We first formalize the attacker model and the different security requirements that applications may have in multi-core systems. We then survey different hardware and software security mechanisms that can be dynamically configured to guarantee security on demand for invasive applications.	0.4
It is well known that beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) play a critical role in emotional arousal and stressful events, but the specific contributions of the beta 2-AR subtype to the psychological disorders are largely unknown. To investigate whether beta 2-AR are involved in anxiety-like behavior and reward to addictive drugs, we conducted a series of behavioral tests on beta 2-AR knock-out (KO) mice. beta 2-AR KO mice exhibited increased preference for the dark compartment and closed arm in tests of Light/Dark box and elevated plus maze, indicating that beta 2-AR deletion elevates level of anxiety or innate fear. beta 2-AR KO mice also showed decreased immobility in tail suspension test (TST), suggesting that beta 2-AR deletion inhibits depression-like behavior. Interestingly, beta 2-AR ablation did not change basal locomotion but significantly increased locomotor activity induced by acute cocaine administration. beta 2-AR KO mice showed enhanced place preference for cocaine, which could be attenuated by b 1-selective AR antagonist betaxolol. Consistently, beta 2-AR agonist suppressed cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). These data indicate that beta 2-AR deletion enhances acute response and reward to cocaine. Our results suggest that beta 2-AR regulates anxiety level, depression-like behavior and hedonic properties of cocaine, implicating that beta 2-AR are the potential targets for the treatment of emotional disorders and cocaine addiction.	5.0
Objective: To investigate the effect of exposure to a virtual reality (VR) environment preoperatively on patient-reported outcomes for surgical operations. Background: There is a scarcity of well-developed quality improvement initiatives targeting patient satisfaction. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing cranial and spinal operations in a tertiary referral center. Patients underwent a 1:1 randomization to an immersive preoperative VR experience or standard preoperative experience stratified on type of operation. The primary outcome measures were the Evaluation du Vecu de l'Anesthesie Generale (EVAN-G) score and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information (APAIS) score, as markers of the patient's experience during the surgical encounter. Results: During the study period, a total of 127 patients (mean age 55.3 years, 41.9% females) underwent randomization. The average EVAN-G score was 84.3 (standard deviation, SD, 6.4) after VR, and 64.3 (SD, 11.7) after standard preoperative experience (difference, 20.0; 95% confidence interval, CI, 16.6-23.3). Exposure to an immersive VR experience also led to higher APAIS score (difference, 29.9; 95% CI, 24.5-35.2). In addition, VR led to lower preoperative VAS stress score (difference, -41.7; 95% CI, -33.1 to -50.2), and higher preoperative VAS preparedness (difference, 32.4; 95% CI, 24.9-39.8), and VAS satisfaction (difference, 33.2; 95% CI, 25.4-41.0) scores. No association was identified with VAS stress score (difference, -1.6; 95% CI, -13.4 to 10.2). Conclusions: In a randomized controlled trial, we demonstrated that patients exposed to preoperative VR had increased satisfaction during the surgical encounter. Harnessing the power of this technology, hospitals can create an immersive environment that minimizes stress, and enhances the perioperative experience.	5.4
The motion of address resolution protocol (ARP) is done without any problem in a general environment, but it is not considered from the security aspect; therefore, it risks being threatened by an attack from the network called ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning. The attacker can approach the transmission data between hosts by disguising itself as a different host through an ARP spoofing attack and can isolate the host as the target of an attack from the network. In this paper, we propose a routing trace-based network security system for preventing ARP spoofing attacks. Our proposed system includes detection, protection, and recovery techniques to prevent an ARP spoofing attack in the internal network. Whether an ARP spoofing attack occurs is confirmed through the periodic monitoring of the ARP table and a routing trace. The system can prevent ARP spoofing attacks without modifications to the ARP or the addition of cryptographic measures. In addition, it provides security and efficiency by overcoming the weak points of the existing researches.	0.2
Purpose of review Galactose - a key source of energy and a crucial structural element in complex molecules - is particularly important for early human development. However, galactose metabolism might be important not only for fetal and neonatal development but also for adulthood, as evidenced by the inherited disorders of galactose metabolism. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current evidence of galactose metabolism in health and disease. Recent findings The biological importance of galactose goes beyond its importance as a nutrient and a metabolite. Galactose has been selected by evolutionary pressure to exert also a crucial structural role in macromolecules. Additionally, galactose has recently been reported as beneficial in a number of diseases, particularly in those affecting the brain. Summary Galactose is crucial for human metabolism, with an established role in energy delivery and galactosylation of complex molecules, and evidence for other roles is emerging.	6.2
Special diets are consumed as a treatment for diseases such as food allergies, diabetes, lactose intolerance, and coeliac disease. Lifestyle-related diets, such as vegetarian, weight-reducing, sports, bodybuilding, and low-carbohydrate diets, can also be called special diets. The aim of this study was to examine the frequency of and reasons for special diet consumption as a therapeutic measure or as a lifestyle-related choice among 12- to 18-year-old Finns. Nationwide cross-sectional data were collected by mailed, self-administered questionnaires in 1999, 2001, 2007, and 2013. The number of respondents varied from 3535 to 8219, and response rates ranged from 38% to 76%. Consumption of special diets, both for therapeutic purposes and as a lifestyle-related choice, showed a significant increasing trend in 12- to 18-year-olds from 1999 to 2013 (p<.001). During the study period, the most frequently-reported single diets in adolescents were vegetarian and lactose intolerance diets. However, a fluctuation trend was observed in the consumption of different lifestyle-related diets. Further, a growing number of respondents, especially girls, reported simultaneous consumption of a combination of two or more therapeutic and/or lifestyle-related diets. The reason(s) for choosing a therapeutic diet seems to stay constant during the studied period. In contrast, a wide variety of reasons such as health, wellbeing, body weight, ethical, and ideological reasons, and the avoidance of some specific foods were given for the consumption of lifestyle-related diets. Our study results correspond well to the increased prevalence of common illnesses in Finland. Data also reveal the properties of special diet consumption among adolescents in the long run, and this highlights the need to further educate Finnish adolescents on nutrition literacy.	5.1
The piston ring pack is important for the sealing of the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine. It plays a major role in friction, wear and oil consumption considerations. Both experimental and theoretical studies in this area are difficult due to the complexity of this highly dynamic system. The paper deals with the numerical investigation by means of computational fluid dynamics of the gas and oil flow in the piston ring pack. Having been validated with experimental data, the simulation results show gas and oil transport mechanisms, which can be used to improve existing models of 0D/1D-simulations. This leads to a better understanding of the processes in the piston ring pack and helps to further optimize the tribological system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.4

This paper presents an overview about the use of goal-oriented strategies, such as output-based aid (OBA) and payment for environmental services (PES), for water pollution abatement and control in urban and rural areas throughout the country. Thus, considering the goal of implementing IWRM, two nation-wide experiences are reviewed: the River Basin Clean-Up Program (PRODES) and the Water Producer Program, both run by the National Water Agency (ANA), the former initiated over a decade ago. They illustrate successful ways to bring public authorities and water users together, in this case, sanitation services and landowners, respectively. Finally, it is discussed the applicability and perspectives for carrying out new goal-oriented initiatives aimed at IWRM in Brazil.	4.4
Transient operations are very crucial for high power insulated-gate bipolar transistor modules, because high current and voltage are applied during this period for several microseconds. Therefore, the ability for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) variable speed wind turbine power converters to withstand abnormal conditions is strictly imperative in order to achieve its lifetime specifications and also fulfil the grid codes. This study presents a new control scheme for DFIG wind turbine having parallel interleaved converters (PIC) configuration and a series dynamic braking resistor (SDBR) connected at its stator side. Interleaving the wind turbine converters in parallel configuration could help to increase the current capability, while the SDBR helps in post fault recovery of the wind turbine. The coordinated control analysis of the scheme was implemented in power system computer aided design and electromagnetic transient including DC simulation environment for a severe three-phase to ground fault. Results obtained were compared with the conventional DC chopper and crowbar rotor circuit protection scheme for the wind turbine. A better performance of the wind turbine variables were achieved using the proposed control scheme of the PIC and SDBR because the space vector modulation of the PIC results in maximum value of the change in common mode voltage, leading to improved switched output voltage of the voltage source converter leg.	3.0
Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships of CYP2C9 and COX-2 genetic polymorphisms with therapeutic efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Material/Methods: We enrolled 130 AS inpatients and outpatients in the Arthritis and Rheumatism Department of Peking University First Hospital and 106 healthy people getting routine check-ups between September 2013 and July 2014. CYP2C9 and COX-2 genetic polymorphisms were detected by PCR-RFLP. All AS patients underwent medical treatment and 12-week follow-up treatment. Score differences of BASDAI, ASAS20, ASAS50, and ASAS70 for AS patients with different genotypes before and after treatment were compared. Results: In terms of COX-2-1290A/G and -1195G/A gene polymorphism genotype and allele frequency, the case group and control group were obviously different (all P0.05). AS patients had improved BASDAI, ASAS20, ASAS50, and ASAS70 scores after they received NSAID treatment (all P<0.05). Furthermore, the efficacy of NSAID in treatment of AS and COX-2 gene -1290A/G and -1195G/A polymorphism were associated (all P0.05). Conclusions: COX-2-1290A/G and -1195G/A polymorphism may increase AS risk and they both can be considered as biological indicators for prediction of efficacy of NSAIDs in treatment of AS.	5.3
Mutations in the TREM2 gene confer risk for Alzheimer's disease and susceptibility for Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the effect of TREM2 deletion in a 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, measuring neurodegeneration and microglia activation using a combined in vivo imaging and postmortem molecular approach. In wild-type mice, MPTP administration induced a progressive decrease of [C-11] FECIT uptake, culminating at day 7. Neuronal loss was accompanied by an increase of TREM2, IL-1 beta, and translocator protein (TSPO) transcript levels, [C-11]PK11195 binding and GFAP staining (from day 2), and an early and transient increase of TNF-alpha, Galectin-3, and Iba-1 (from day 1). In TREM2 null (TREM2(-/-)) mice, MPTP similarly affected neuron viability and microglial cells, as shown by the lower level of Iba-1 staining in basal condition, and reduced increment of Iba-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta in response to MPTP. Likely to compensate for TREM2 absence, TREM2(-/-) mice showed an earlier increment of [C-11] PK11195 binding and a significant increase of IL-4. Taken together, our data demonstrate a central role of TREM2 in the regulation of microglia response to acute neurotoxic insults and suggest a potential modulatory role of TSPO in response to immune system deficit.

Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical step in the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This process is characterized by the transmigration of activated T cells across brain endothelial cells (ECs), the main constituents of the BBB. However, the consequences on brain EC function upon interaction with such T cells are largely unknown. Here we describe an assay that allows for the evaluation of primary mouse brain microvascular EC (MBMEC) function and barrier integrity during the interaction with T cells over time. The assay makes use of impedance cell spectroscopy, a powerful tool for studying EC monolayer integrity and permeability, by measuring changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and cell layer capacitance (Ccl). In direct contact with ECs, stimulated but not naive T cells are capable of inducing EC monolayer dysfunction, as visualized by a decrease in TEER and an increase in Ccl. The assay records changes in EC monolayer integrity in a continuous and automated fashion. It is sensitive enough to distinguish between different strengths of stimuli and levels of T cell activation and it enables the investigation of the consequences of a targeted modulation of T cell-EC interaction using a wide range of substances such as antibodies, pharmacological reagents and cytokines. The technique can also be used as a quality control for EC integrity in in vitro T-cell transmigration assays. These applications make it a versatile tool for studying BBB properties under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.	6.3
Alya is a multi-physics simulation code developed at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). From its inception Alya code is designed using advanced High Performance Computing programming techniques to solve coupled problems on supercomputers efficiently. The target domain is engineering, with all its particular features: complex geometries and unstructured meshes, coupled multi-physics with exotic coupling schemes and physical models, ill-posed problems, flexibility needs for rapidly including new models, etc. Since its beginnings in 2004, Alya has scaled well in an increasing number of processors when solving single-physics problems such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, acoustics, etc. Over time, we have made a concerted effort to maintain and even improve scalability for multi-physics problems. This poses challenges on multiple fronts, including: numerical models, parallel implementation, physical coupling models, algorithms and solution schemes, meshing process, etc. In this paper, we introduce Alya's main features and focus particularly on its solvers. We present Alya's performance up to 100.000 processors in Blue Waters, the NCSA supercomputer with selected multi-physics tests that are representative of the engineering world. The tests are incompressible flow in a human respiratory system, low Mach combustion problem in a kiln furnace, and coupled electro-mechanical contraction of the heart. We show scalability plots for all cases and discuss all aspects of such simulations, including solver convergence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.4
In this study the authors report the first example of spinal pseudarthrosis in a patient with ochronosis, and they describe the application of posterior-only 360 surgery as an alternative approach to combined anterior-posterior surgery in the management of pseudarthrosis of an ankylosed spine, regardless of its etiology. Spinal involvement in ochronosis produces loss of flexibility and ankylosis of thoracic and lumbar segments. Pseudarthrosis is a serious complication of the diseases that present with ankylosis of the spine. However, its occurrence in ochronotic spine has not been reported previously. Evaluation of progressive paraparesis in a 68-year-old man with ochronosis revealed pseudarthrosis at the T11-12 level. Circumferential dural sac decompression, debridement of the disc space, interbody fusion, and screw-rod fixation were all done via a posterior-only approach. Postoperatively the patient exhibited a marked recovery in terms of pain and neurological status. At the 3-month follow-up, he was able to walk independently. Ochronosis should be included in the etiology of pseudarthrosis. With aggravation of back pain and the appearance of neurological deficits in an already stable patient with any ankylosing disease, pseudarthrosis should be suspected. Furthermore, single-stage, 360, posterior-only surgery may obviate the need for single-stage or staged anterior-posterior surgical intervention in patients with pseudarthrosis of the thoracic and lumbar spine.	5.3
Introduction to Engineering Technology is a typical first-year course in the mechanical engineering technology curriculum of many institutions. The course is intended to introduce students to a number of aspects in the discipline of engineering, including design and manufacturing, engineering ethics, team work, and other areas, with the goal of motivating students in the engineering profession. As a means of improving instruction and better engaging students in their learning process in an Introduction to Engineering Technology course at the Wentworth Institute of Technology, this paper presents a series of hands-on active learning activities, which deploy innovative materials and techniques supported largely by information technology. These innovative learning activities include the use of hands-on lab projects, a focus on interdisciplinary topics, and the leveraging of Internet resources, video, and You Tube clips. All hands-on projects are directly related to each subject area in the mechanical engineering field, which helps students to understand and to feel the engineering profession. Feedback from students concerning the course has been positive, and anecdotal observations indicate that the innovative learning activities motivated the students and enhanced their learning experience.	3.2
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) accounts for approximately 1% of all CRCs. Adenomatous polyposis syndromes can be divided into; familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) - classic FAP and attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), MUTYHassociated polyposis (MAP), NTHL1-associated polyposis (NAP) and polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (PPAP). The polyposis syndromes genetics and clinical manifestation of disease varies and cases with clinical diagnosis of FAP might molecularly show a different diagnosis. This review examines different aspects of the adenomatous polyposis syndromes genetics and clinical manifestation of disease; in addition the genotype-phenotype and modifier alleles of FAP will be discussed. New technology has made it possible to diagnose some of the APC mutation negative patients into their respective syndromes. There still remain many molecularly undiagnosed adenomatous polyposis patients indicating that there remain causative genes to be discovered and with today's technology these are expected to be identified in the near future. The knowledge about the role of modifier alleles in FAP will contribute to improved pre-symptomatic diagnosis and treatment. New novel mutations will continually be discovered in genes already associated with disease and new genes will be discovered that are associated with adenomatous polyposis. The search for modifier alleles in FAP should be made a priority.	6.4
Background: Approximately 70% of rural Nigerian households rely on biomass fuels for cooking. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) estimates the prevalence of current wheeze among children in Nigeria to have risen from 10.7% in 1999 to approximately 20% in 2014. Objective: To examine the effects of biomass smoke exposure on asthma symptom prevalence in rural children in Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in rural communities in Nigeria. Asthma symptoms were defined according to ISAAC definitions. Biomass smoke exposure was determined by the types of fuel used for cooking. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between biomass smoke and asthma symptoms. Results: The study population comprised 1,690 school children, of which 865 lived in households cooking with biomass and 825 lived in households not using biomass. Asthma symptoms were reported in 481 (28.5%) children. Biomass fuel was associated with increased odds of asthma symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.05-1.80) for nocturnal cough, 1.26 (95% CI: 1.00-1.61) for current wheeze, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.05-1.69) for report of any asthma-related symptoms. Sex modified the associations between asthma symptoms with biomass fuel: aORs were stronger and significant for males (nocturnal cough = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.24-2.76; current wheeze = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.03-2.13; report of any asthma-related symptoms = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12-2.28), but weaker and non-significant for females.Conclusion: The risk of asthma symptoms related to biomass smoke exposure appears to differ by sex.	5.1
A prerequisite for reliable hydraulic measurements is an accurate collection of the plant material. Thereby, the native hydraulic state of the sample has to be preserved during harvesting (i.e., cutting the plant or plant parts) and preparation (i.e., excising the target section). This is particularly difficult when harvesting has to be done under transpiring conditions. In this article, we present a harvesting and sampling protocol designed for hydraulic measurements on Malus domestica Borkh. and checked for possible sampling artefacts. To test for artefacts, we analysed the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity, maximum specific conductivity and water contents of bark and wood of branches, taking into account conduit length, time of day of harvesting, different shoot ages and seasonal effects. Our results prove that use of appropriate protocols can avoid artefactual embolization or refilling even when the xylem is under tension at harvest. The presented protocol was developed for Malus but may also be applied for other angiosperms with similar anatomy and refilling characteristics.	3.1
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) films were electrochemically deposited on glassy carbon (GC) disk electrodes using aqueous solutions containing 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and sulfonated calixarenes or fullerene-sulfonated calixarene (C-60-calixarene) complexes. The EDOT monomer was added to aqueous sulfonated calixarene solutions with and without C-60 and from these solutions PEDOT(calixarene) and PEDOT(C-60-calixarene) films were electrochemically deposited on GC disk electrodes. The electrochemical properties of GC/PEDOT(C-60-calixarene) were compared with those of GC/PEDOT doped with other ions, both in aqueous and organic electrolyte solutions using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV measurements carried out on GC/PEDOT(C-60-calixarene) in 0.1 M aqueous KCl solution showed a reduction peak at ca. -0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl only during the first potential scan. This was attributed to the irreversible reduction of C-60 to C-60(-) inside the PEDOT film. This additional reduction peak was, however, not observed when recording the CVs in organic solution, indicating that C-60 was dissolved from the PEDOT film into the organic electrolyte solution, that is a good solvent for C-60. When performing CV measurements in an organic electrolyte solution containing C-60, all GC/PEDOT electrodes with various doping ions and bare GC electrodes showed a reversible reduction peak characteristic for the C-60/C-60(-) redox couple. Interestingly, the peak potential and the shape of the reoxidation peak for the fulleride anion (C-60(-)) on GC/PEDOT in the organic electrolyte solution were found to depend on the PEDOT film thickness. The electrochemical properties of GC/PEDOT(C-60-calixarene) were compared further to those of GC/PEDOT(calixarene) by fitting EIS data to equivalent electrical circuits and the morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy.

Young Latino gay and bisexual men experience discrimination due to heterosexism and racism from within and beyond their communities. Although most research has emphasised overt forms of discrimination, a growing body of research is examining the effects of microaggressions, or indirect forms of discrimination, on racial and sexual minorities. The purpose of this study was to explore the contexts of various types of microaggressions, as well as describe the resilience strategies used by young adult Latino gay and bisexual men living in Los Angeles, California. A sample of 21 young Latino gay and bisexual men aged 18 to 29years were recruited to complete qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews following a phenomenological approach. Three contextual themes relevant to microaggressions emerged: (1) microassaults, (2) microinsults and (3) microinvalidations. Three themes emerged around the resilience strategies to overcome these experiences: (1) self-discovery, (2) adaptive socialisation and (3) self-advocacy. Family and community-based efforts to reinforce and expand resilience repertoires are needed to help young Latino gay and bisexual men.

Introduction: Combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART) has not allowed the cure of HIV. The main obstacle to HIV eradication is the existence of quiescent reservoirs. Several other limitations of cART have been described, such as strict life-long treatment and high costs, restricting it to Western countries, as well as the development of multidrug resistance. Given these limitations and the impetus to find a cure, the development of new treatments is necessary.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the current status of several efficient molecules able to suppress HIV gene transcription, including NF-kB and Tat inhibitors. We also assess the potential of new proteins belonging to the intriguing DING family, which have been reported to have potential anti-HIV-1 activity by inhibiting HIV gene transcription.Expert opinion: Targeting HIV-1 gene transcription is an alternative approach, which could overcome cART-related issues, such as the emergence of multidrug resistance. Improving cART will rely on the identification and characterization of new actors inhibiting HIV-1 transcription. Combining such efforts with the use of new technologies, the development of new models for preclinical studies, and improvement in drug delivery will considerably reduce drug toxicity and thus increase patient adherence.	3.0
Lightweight devices such as smart cards and RFID tags have a very limited hardware resource, which could be too weak to cope with asymmetric-key cryptography. It would be desirable if the cryptographic algorithm could be optimized in order to better use hardware resources. In this paper, we demonstrate how identity-based encryption algorithms from bilinear pairing can be optimized so that hardware resources can be saved. We notice that the identity-based encryption algorithms from bilinear pairing in the literature must perform both elliptic curve group operations and multiplicative group operations, which consume a lot of hardware resources. We manage to eliminate the need of multiplicative group operations for encryption. This is a significant discovery since the hardware structure can be simplified for implementing pairing-based cryptography. Our experimental results show that our encryption algorithm saves up to 47 percent memory (27,239 RAM bits) in FPGA implementation.	0.3
Microscale mechanical networks are prevalent in lab-ona- chip systems, which are rapidly expanding into biological, chemical, and physical research. In these systems, nano-liter volumes of fluids are manipulated and a precise control of flow in individual segments within a complex network is often desirable. One paradigm for such control suggests adjusting the hydraulic resistance of each segment, relying on the fact that like in electrical circuits, fluid flow is depended upon the relation between the potential drop (pressure difference) and the resistance of the transmitting conductor. Current solutions for the control of hydraulic resistance rely on intricate fabrication processes, are often characterized by a high-biased error and can generally produce a limited range of resistance. Here, a computer-aided design of a six-bit digitally controlled adjustable hydraulic resistor, which features five linear ranges of resistance and a small footprint is presented. This design can be rapidly embedded within a microfluidic network for real time control of fluid flow.	1.2
Hyperspectral remote sensing data offer the opportunity to map urban characteristics in detail. Though, adequate algorithms need to cope with increasing data dimensionality, high redundancy between individual bands, and often spectrally complex urban landscapes. The study focuses on subpixel quantification of urban land cover compositions using simulated environmental mapping and analysis program (EnMAP) data acquired over the city of Berlin, utilizing both machine learning regression and classification algorithms, i.e., multioutput support vector regression (MSVR), standard support vector regression (SVR), import vector machine classifier (IVM), and support vector classifier (SVC). The experimental setup incorporates a spectral library and a reference land cover fraction map used for validation purposes. The library spectra were synthetically mixed to derive quantitative training data for the classes vegetation, impervious surface, soil, and water. MSVR and SVR models were trained directly using the synthetic mixtures. For IVM and SVC, a modified hyperparameter selection approach is conducted to improve the description of urban land cover fractions by means of probability outputs. Validation results demonstrate the high potential of the MSVR for subpixel mapping in the urban context. MSVR outperforms SVR in terms of both accuracy and computational time. IVM and SVC work similarly well, yet with lower accuracies of subpixel fraction estimates compared to both regression approaches.	0.1
This paper presents a comparison of two inlet permanent magnet synchronous machines with concentrated windings. A novel 24-teeth/28-poles machine design with flux barriers in the stator teeth is compared to a common 30teeth/20-poles design, which is widely used for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications. Detailed comparison of important machine characteristics such as torque ripple, iron losses, eddy current losses in the magnets, axial length and machine weight is presented. According to the study, the novel 24-teeth/28-poles machine design offers a high saving potential concerning the space requirement and production costs. At the same time this machine topology generates a smoother torque compared to the 30-teeth/20-poles topology.	3.3
This paper provides an analysis in the time and frequency domain of an RC electrical circuit described by a fractional differential equation of the order 0 < alpha a parts per thousand currency sign 1. We use the Laplace transform of the fractional derivative in the Caputo sense. In the time domain we emphasize on the delay, rise and settling times, while in the frequency domain the interest is in the cutoff frequency, the bandwidth and the asymptotes in low and high frequencies. All these quantities depend on the order of differential equation.	1.2
Climate change has been shown to increase the number of mountain lakes across various mountain ranges in the World. In Central Asia, and in particular on the territory of Uzbekistan, a detailed assessment of glacier lakes and their evolution over time is, however lacking. For this reason we created the first detailed inventory of mountain lakes of Uzbekistan based on recent (2002-2014) satellite observations usingWorldView-2, SPOT5, and IKONOS imagery with a spatial resolution from 2 to 10 m. This record was complemented with data from field studies of the last 50 years. The previous data were mostly in the form of inventories of lakes, available in Soviet archives, and primarily included localized in-situ data. The inventory of mountain lakes presented here, by contrast, includes an overview of all lakes of the territory of Uzbekistan. Lakes were considered if they were located at altitudes above 1500 m and if lakes had an area exceeding 100 m(2). As in other mountain regions of the World, the ongoing increase of air temperatures has led to an increase in lake number and area. Moreover, the frequency and overall number of lake outburst events have been on the rise as well. Therefore, we also present the first outburst assessment with an updated version of well-known approaches considering local climate features and event histories. As a result, out of the 242 lakes identified on the territory of Uzbekistan, 15% are considered prone to outburst, 10% of these lakes have been assigned low outburst potential and the remainder of the lakes have an average level of outburst potential. We conclude that the distribution of lakes by elevation shows a significant influence on lake area and hazard potential. No significant differences, by contrast, exist between the distribution of lake area, outburst potential, and lake location with respect to glaciers by regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) facilitates prosocial behavior and selective sociality. In the context of stress, OXT also can down-regulate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, leading to consideration of OXT as a potential treatment for many socioaffective disorders. However, the mechanisms through which administration of exogenous OXT modulates social behavior in stressful environmental contexts are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that autonomic pathways are components of the mechanisms through which OXT aids the recruitment of social resources in stressful contexts that may elicit mobilized behavioral responses. Female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) underwent a stressor (walking in shallow water) following pretreatment with intraperitoneal OXT (0.25 mg/kg) or OXT antagonist (OXT-A, 20 mg/kg), and were allowed to recover with or without their sibling cagemate. Administration of OXT resulted in elevated OXT concentrations in plasma, but did not dampen the HPA axis response to a stressor. However, OXT, but not OXT-A, pretreatment prevented the functional coupling, usually seen in the absence of OXT, between paraventricular nucleus (PVN) activity as measured by c-Fos immunoreactivity and HPA output (i.e. corticosterone release). Furthermore, OXT pretreatment resulted in functional coupling between PVN activity and brain regions regulating both sympathetic (i.e. rostral ventrolateral medulla) and parasympathetic (i.e. dorsal vagal complex and nucleus ambiguous) branches of the autonomic nervous system. These findings suggest that OXT increases central neural control of autonomic activity, rather than strictly dampening HPA axis activity, and provides a potential mechanism through which OXT may facilitate adaptive and context-dependent behavioral and physiological responses to stressors.

Past research has demonstrated that perceivers are more likely to draw spontaneous trait inferences (STIs) from stereotype-consistent behaviors than from stereotype-inconsistent behaviors. Four studies were conducted to examine the moderating role of power in stereotype effects on STIs. Priming power using the scrambled sentence task, Study 1 found that high-power participants drew STIs from elderly stereotype-consistent but not from elderly stereotype-inconsistent sentences, while low-power participants did not draw STIs from elderly stereotype-consistent or stereotype-inconsistent behaviors. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 by exploring the moderating role of power in gender stereotype effects on STIs. Measuring participants' dispositional power via the Personal Sense of Power, Study 3 found that dispositional power also moderated the effects of gender stereotype on STIs. Study 4 found that compared with the baseline condition (nopower manipulation), the low-power condition inhibited STIs from stereotype-consistent behaviors, but the high-power condition did not facilitate STI formation from stereotype-consistent behaviors. The current study is the first to show that power influences the reliance on stereotypes when spontaneously inferring traits from behaviors.	2.0
Artificial insemination with cryopreserved semen enables affordable, large-scale dissemination of gametes with superior genetics. However, cryopreservation can cause functional and structural damage to spermatozoa that is associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impairment of sperm motility and decreased fertilizing potential, but little attention has been paid to protein changes. The goal of this study was to investigate the oxidative modifications (measured as carbonylation level changes) of bull spermatozoa proteins triggered by the cryopreservation process. Flow cytometry and computer assisted sperm analysis were used to evaluate changes in viability, ROS level and motility of spermatozoa. Western blotting, in conjunction with two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-oxyblot) and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight spectrometry, was employed to identify and quantify the specifically carbonylated spermatozoa proteins. Cryopreservation decreased motility and viability but increased the number of ROS-positive cells. We identified 11 proteins (ropporin-1, outer dense fiber protein 2, glutathione S-transferase, triosephosphate isomerase, capping protein beta 3 isoform, actin-related protein Ml, actin-related protein T2, NADH dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, cilia- and flagella-associated protein 161, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4) showing differences in protein carbonylation in response to cryopreservation. The identified proteins are associated with cytoskeleton and flagella organization, detoxification and energy metabolism. Moreover, almost all of the identified carbonylated proteins are involved in capacitation. Our results indicate for the first time that cryopreservation induces oxidation of selected sperm proteins via carbonylation. We suggest that carbonylation of sperm proteins could be a direct result of oxidative stress and potentially lead to disturbances of capacitation-involved proteins or could indicate cryopreservation-induced premature capacitation.

Introduction: Amyloid imaging has been integrated into diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD). How amyloid tracers binding differ for different tracer structures and amyloid-beta aggregates in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and sporadic AD is unclear. Methods: Binding properties of different amyloid tracers were examined in brain homogenates from six ADAD with APPswe, PS1 M146V, and PS1 E Delta 9 mutations, 13 sporadic AD, and 14 control cases. Results: H-3-PIB, H-3-florbetaben, H-3-AZD2184, and BTA-1 shared a high-and a varying low-affinity binding site in the frontal cortex of sporadic AD. AZD2184 detected another binding site (affinity 33 nM) in the frontal cortex of ADAD. The H-3-AZD2184 and H-3-PIB binding were significantly higher in the striatum of ADAD compared to sporadic AD and control. Polyphenol resveratrol showed strongest inhibition on H-3-AZD84 binding followed by H-3-florbetaben and minimal on H-3-PIB. Discussion: This study implies amyloid tracers of different structures detect different sites on amyloid-beta fibrils or conformations. (C) 2016 the Alzheimer's Association.

HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world.	2.0
Mindfulness has been studied extensively in both basic and clinical settings; however, discussions still persist. The current research approached this issue by creating a new measure of trait mindfulness. The construct defined within is end-state mindfulness and is a tendency to see things as they are moment by moment without any judgment. The newly created scale was validated in three studies. End-state mindfulness was negatively correlated with rumination, suppression, neuroticism, and better-than-average effect, but was not correlated with both positive and negative trait-affectivity; it also moderated negative emotional reactions in the context of mortality salience. End-state mindfulness was differentiated from the past measure of mindfulness in many aspects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	2.1
Six years have passed since the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in the United States launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. The RDoC introduces a framework for research on the biology of mental illness that integrates research findings across multiple levels of information. The framework outlines constructs that represent specific quantifiable dimensions of behavior (e.g., responses to acute threat, cognitive control) and corresponding units of analysis that can be used to study the constructs, beginning at the levels of genes, molecules, cells, circuits and physiology, and moving up to behaviors and self-reports. In this systematic review, a literature search was conducted to synthesize empirical research published since the proposal of the framework that incorporated the RDoC. Forty-eight peer-reviewed scholarly articles met eligibility criteria for the review. Studies differed according to whether they analyzed RDoC constructs and units of analysis within vs. between clinically-diagnosed and non-psychiatric samples. The most commonly studied constructs were subsumed within the domains of Negative Valence Systems, Positive Valence Systems and Cognitive Systems, providing initial results which primarily connected genetics, brain circuits and physiology research findings with behavior and self-reports. Prospects for future research adopting the RDoC matrix and utilizing a dimensional approach to studying the biology of mental illness are discussed.	6.4
The use of nuclear energy to generate electric power is crucial to meet the high energy demand of a modern economy. In newly constructed nuclear power plants (NPPs), the trend among control systems is to replace the obsolete analog hard-wired systems with the contemporary digital and cyber-based systems. Therefore, cyberphysical security as well as dependability are critical issues in safety critical NPPs. In this paper, we present different levels/layers of protection to manage cyber/physical security. We also discuss the interrelationship between cyber and physical attacks. We adopt generalized stochastic Petri nets to quantitatively evaluate the intrusion probability. We then propose a new cyberframework and show that the proposed framework not only prevents cyberattacks but also conforms to cybersecurity regulations. We also propose a physical framework to prevent potential physical attacks. Finally, we discuss dependability through three metrics, i.e., reliability, maintainability, and availability. A case study is presented to demonstrate that the proposed cyberframework is highly dependable through analyzing steady-state probabilities.	1.4
In English-speaking western cultures the punitive attitudes towards law-breakers is well documented. The present study examines the utility of predictors of punitive attitudes with online survey data obtained from a convenience sample of 566 Australian residents. After controlling for demographic variables, the study examines the utility of two theoretical models; the Crime-distrust model and the Racial-animus model, in predicting punitive attitudes. All three factors of the Crime-distrust model significantly predict punitive attitudes. The study extends the current literature through identifying the significance of negative perceptions of Indigenous Australians in predicting punitive attitudes to sentencing. Results suggest that community perception of Indigenous Australians is a significant predictor of punitive attitudes in addition to factors of the Crime-distrust model. Future research using a more representative sample of the Australian population is recommended to increase the confidence with which findings are interpreted.	2.0
Despite decades of study, no scholarly consensus has emerged regarding whether violent video games contribute to youth violence. Some skeptics contend that small correlations between violent game play and violence-related outcomes may be due to other factors, which include a wide range of possible effects from gender, mental health, and social influences. The current study examines this issue with a large and diverse (49 % white, 21 % black, 18 % Hispanic, and 12 % other or mixed race/ethnicity; 51 % female) sample of youth in eighth (n = 5133) and eleventh grade (n = 3886). Models examining video game play and violence-related outcomes without any controls tended to return small, but statistically significant relationships between violent games and violence-related outcomes. However, once other predictors were included in the models and once propensity scores were used to control for an underlying propensity for choosing or being allowed to play violent video games, these relationships vanished, became inverse, or were reduced to trivial effect sizes. These results offer further support to the conclusion that video game violence is not a meaningful predictor of youth violence and, instead, support the conclusion that family and social variables are more influential factors.	2.4
Three dimensional virtual worlds (3DVW) have experienced a large growth in number of users, and are being used for collaboration activities. In parallel, the research field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) has developed taxonomies to classify systems that support collaboration. However, the CSCW perspective presents a bias towards traditional user interface paradigms, whose affordances are quite distinct from those of 3DVW, which include features such as the spatial environment, embodiment, and their dynamics. These are features which are regarded as significant factors in the research field of Presence, and yet, in our opinion, are not well appreciated from the perspective of CSCW analysis. Because of this, we question of the ability of CSCW taxonomies to properly describe the collaboration characteristics of 3DVW. By properly, we mean to say that 3DVW bring to fore collaboration characteristics that are in fact distinctive of them as collaboration tools, impacting collaboration in ways that are seldom found in usual groupware, and yet CSCW taxonomies do not distinguish them. We posit that these features should be contemplated in CSCW taxonomies and their usefulness taken into account in the development of future systems that aim to support collaboration.	2.3
Physical attractiveness is suggested to be an indicator of biological quality and therefore should be stable. However, transient factors such as gaze direction and facial expression affect facial attractiveness, suggesting it is not. We compared the relative importance of variation between faces with variation within faces due to facial expressions. 128 participants viewed photographs of 14 men and 16 women displaying the six basic facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and a neutral expression. Each rater saw each model only once with a randomly chosen expression. The effect of expressions on attractiveness was similar in male and female faces, although several expressions were not significantly different from each other. Identity was 2.2 times as important as emotion in attractiveness for both male and female pictures, suggesting that attractiveness is stable. Since the hard tissues of the face are unchangeable, people may still be able to perceive facial structure whatever expression the face is displaying, and still make attractiveness judgements based on structural cues.	2.2
Objective: This research focused on how race-based rejection sensitivity (RS-Race) and components of racial identity intensify negative psychological reactions to an incident of vicarious racism. We examined how these individual difference variables directly and/or indirectly predicted African American students' reactions to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of the African American teenager, Trayvon Martin. Method: In Study 1, 471 African American students completed measures of RS-Race, thought intrusions about the Zimmerman trial, and outcome variables (negative affect about the Zimmerman trial and forgiveness for Mr. Zimmerman). In Study 2, 304 African American students completed measures of racial identity (centrality, private regard, and public regard), thought intrusions about the Zimmerman trial, negative affect, and forgiveness. Results: In Study 1, higher RS-Race was either directly and/or indirectly (via thought intrusions) related to more negative affect and lower forgiveness. In Study 2, high racial centrality and low public regard either directly and/or indirectly (via thought intrusions) predicted more negative affect and lower forgiveness. Conclusions: RS-Race and specific components of racial identity are likely to sensitize African Americans to incidents of racism that happen to other African Americans, leading to negative psychological reactions when these events occur.	2.0
To compare MRI-defined back muscle volume between AS patients and age, and spinopelvic alignment matched control patients with chronic back pain. 51 male patients with AS were enrolled. Age and spinopelvic alignment matched controls (male) were found among non-AS patients with chronic back pain. After matching procedure, fully matched controls were found in 31 of 51 AS patients (60.8%), who represent AS patients without deformity. However, matched controls were not found in 20 of 51 AS patients (39.2%), who represent AS patients with deformity. MRI parameters of back muscle (paraspinal muscle and psoas muscle) at L4/5 disc level including cross-sectional area (CSA) and fat-free cross-sectional area (FCSA) were compared between AS patients and matched controls. Covariates, including BMI, self-reported physical activity, and the presence of chronic disease, which can influence back muscle volume, were also investigated. There were no statistical differences in age, body mass index, score of back pain (NRS), and spinopelvic alignment, and physical activity between matched AS patients and control patients except for duration of back pain. All MRI parameters for paraspinal muscle volume in matched AS patients (without deformity) were significantly less than those of control patients, and significantly larger than those of non-matched AS patients (with deformity). Body size adjusted MRI parameters (relative CSA and relative FCSA) of paraspinal muscle showed strong correlations with lumbar lordosis and sacral slope. Such relationship between paraspinal muscle and spinopelvic parameters remained significant even after multivariate adjustment. AS patients without deformity already have decreased paraspinal muscle volume compared with age and spinopelvic alignment matched non-AS patients with chronic back pain. Such decrease in paraspinal muscle volume was significantly associated with kyphotic deformity of AS patients even after multivariate adjustment. Although the result of our study supports the causal relationship between muscle degeneration and kyphotic deformity in AS patients, further study is required to prove the causality.	5.3
Domestic dogs have an ancient origin and a long history in Africa. Nevertheless, the timing and sources of their introduction into Africa remain enigmatic. Herein, we analyse variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop sequences from 345 Nigerian and 37 Kenyan village dogs plus 1530 published sequences of dogs from other parts of Africa, Europe and West Asia. All Kenyan dogs can be assigned to one of three haplogroups (matrilines; clades): A, B, and C, while Nigerian dogs can be assigned to one of four haplogroups A, B, C, and D. None of the African dogs exhibits a matrilineal contribution from the African wolf (Canis lupus lupaster). The genetic signal of a recent demographic expansion is detected in Nigerian dogs from West Africa. The analyses of mitochondrial genomes reveal a maternal genetic link between modern West African and North European dogs indicated by sub-haplogroup D1 (but not the entire haplogroup D) coalescing around 12,000 years ago. Incorporating molecular anthropological evidence, we propose that sub-haplogroup D1 in West African dogs could be traced back to the late-glacial dispersals, potentially associated with human hunter-gatherer migration from southwestern Europe.

Objective: Psychiatric symptoms of varying degrees that accompany hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) may continue throughout the pregnancy or after, and these psychological problems may cause morbidity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the HG and psychiatric symptoms in the first trimester and postpartum depression. Methods: Two hundred and seven pregnant who were diagnosed as HG and 177 healthy pregnant women included in this prospective study. All cases were assessed with SCL-90-R in first trimester and with ED in postpartum period. Factors related to postpartum psychiatric symptoms were investigated with bivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: SCL-90-R and ED scores were statistically significant at HG group (p<0.05). In cases who diagnosed as postpartum depression, the rates of HG and SCL-90-R results were higher (p<0.05). In the bivariate analysis, the high rates of HG and high SCL-90-R scores were determined to be related to postpartum depression (p<0.05). Conclusions: The results show that mental health is negatively affected by HG at pregnancy, and in this case, psychiatric symptoms may continue even after discontinuation HG.	5.4
Background: In 2014, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) reported that the highest prevalence of symptoms of severe asthma was found in the low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Nigeria. While exposure to biomass fuel use may be an important risk factor in the development of asthma, its association with asthma symptoms severity has not been well-established. The aim of this study is to extend the spectrum of environmental risk factors that may be contributing towards increasing asthma morbidity, especially asthma symptoms severity in rural schoolchildren in Nigeria and to examine possible asthma underdiagnosis among this population. Methods: Authors conducted a cross-sectional survey in three rural communities in Nigeria. Asthma symptoms were defined according to the ISAAC criteria. Information on the types of household fuel used for cooking was used to determine household cooking fuel status. Asthma symptoms severity was defined based on frequencies of wheeze, day-and night-time symptoms, and speech limitations. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore associations. Results: A total of 1,690 Nigerian schoolchildren participated in the study. Overall, 37 (2.2%) had diagnosed asthma and 413 (24.4%) had possible asthma (asthma-related symptoms but not diagnosed asthma). Children from biomass fuel households had higher proportion of possible asthma (27.7 vs. 22.2%; p < 0.05) and symptoms of severe asthma (18.2 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.048). In adjusted analyses, biomass fuel use was associated with increased odds of severe symptoms of asthma [odds ratios (OR) = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.16-4.84], but not with possible asthma (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.95-1.56). Conclusion: In rural Nigerian children with asthma symptoms, the use of biomass fuel for cooking is associated with an increased risk of severe asthma symptoms. There is additional evidence that rural children might be underdiagnosed for asthma.	5.1
The traditional research of information dissemination is mostly based on the virus spreading model that the information is being spread by probability, which does not match very well to the reality, because the information that we receive is always more or less than what was sent. In order to quantitatively describe variations in the amount of information during the spreading process, this article proposes a safety information radiation model on the basis of communication theory, combining with relevant theories of complex networks. This model comprehensively considers the various influence factors when safety information radiates in the network, and introduces some concepts from the communication theory perspective, such as the radiation gain function, receiving gain function, information retaining capacity and information second reception capacity, to describe the safety information radiation process between nodes and dynamically investigate the states of network nodes. On a micro level, this article analyzes the influence of various initial conditions and parameters on safety information radiation through the new model simulation. The simulation reveals that this novel approach can reflect the variation of safety information quantity of each node in the complex network, and the scale-free network has better radiation explosive power, while the small-world network has better radiation staying power. The results also show that it is efficient to improve the overall performance of network security by selecting nodes with high degrees as the information source, refining and simplifying the information, increasing the information second reception capacity and decreasing the noises. In a word, this article lays the foundation for further research on the interactions of information and energy between internal components within complex systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is a common goal to improve safety and performance of mobile indoor robots by predicting the movements of people in the surroundings. In contrast to many related works which exclusively employ sensors mounted on mobile robots, this work shows a method to achieve this goal in a smart environment where external sensors are used to sense people's positions. By using probabilistic models and filters, the evolution of the environment's state is predicted and optimal paths with respect to safety and performance are planned. Experiments in reality and in a simulation environment show the applicability in real-world scenarios and the advantages over classical path planning approaches.	4.0
Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens and bryophytes in varying proportions, which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimeters of the soil in arid and semiarid regions. As biocrusts are highly relevant for ecosystem processes like carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, a correct characterization of their spatial distribution is required. Following this objective, considerable efforts have been devoted to the identification and mapping of biocrusts using remote sensing data, and several mapping indices have been developed. However, their transferability to different regions has only rarely been tested. In this study we investigated the transferability of two multispectral indices, i.e. the Crust Index (CI) and the Biological Soil Crust Index (BSCI), and two hyperspectral indices, i.e. the Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) and the Crust Development Index (CDI), in three sites dominated by biocrusts, but with differences in soil and vegetation composition. Whereas multispectral indices have been important and valuable tools for first approaches to map and classify biological soil crusts, hyperspectral data and indices developed for these allowed to classify biocrusts at much higher accuracy. While multispectral indices showed Kappa (kappa) values below 0.6, hyperspectral indices obtained good classification accuracy (kappa similar to 0.8) in both the study area where they had been developed and in the newly tested region. These results highlight the capability of hyperspectral sensors to identify specific absorption features related to photosynthetic pigments as chlorophyll and carotenoids, but also the limitation of multispectral information to discriminate between areas dominated by biocrusts, vegetation or bare soil. Based on these results we conclude that remote sensing offers an important and valid tool to map biocrusts. However, the spectral similarity between the main surface components of drylands and biocrusts demand for mapping indices based on hyperspectral information to correctly map areas dominated by biocrusts at ecosystem scale.

Fine-grained image recognition, a computer vision task filled with challenges due to its imperceptible inter-class variance and large intra-class variance, has been drawing increasing attention. While manual annotation can be utilized to effectively enhance performance in this task, it is extremely time-consuming and expensive. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification. We propose a fine-grained image recognition framework by exploiting CNN as the raw feature extractor along with several effective methods including a feature encoding method, a feature weighting method, and a strategy to better incorporate information from multi-scale images to further improve recognition ability. Besides, we investigate two dimension reduction methods and successfully merge them to our framework to compact the final image representation. Based on the discriminative and compact framework, we achieved the state-of-the-art performance in terms of classification accuracy on several fine-grained image recognition benchmarks based on weekly supervision.	0.0
Background: Feature selection methods are commonly used to identify subsets of relevant features to facilitate the construction of models for classification, yet little is known about how feature selection methods perform in diffusion tensor images (DTIs). In this study, feature selection and machine learning classification methods were tested for the purpose of automating diagnosis of migraines using both DTIs and questionnaire answers related to emotion and cognition - factors that influence of pain perceptions. Methods: We select 52 adult subjects for the study divided into three groups: control group (15), subjects with sporadic migraine (19) and subjects with chronic migraine and medication overuse (18). These subjects underwent magnetic resonance with diffusion tensor to see white matter pathway integrity of the regions of interest involved in pain and emotion. The tests also gather data about pathology. The DTI images and test results were then introduced into feature selection algorithms (Gradient Tree Boosting, L1-based, Random Forest and Univariate) to reduce features of the first dataset and classification algorithms (SVM (Support Vector Machine), Boosting (Adaboost) and Naive Bayes) to perform a classification of migraine group. Moreover we implement a committee method to improve the classification accuracy based on feature selection algorithms. Results: When classifying the migraine group, the greatest improvements in accuracy were made using the proposed committee-based feature selection method. Using this approach, the accuracy of classification into three types improved from 67 to 93% when using the Naive Bayes classifier, from 90 to 95% with the support vector machine classifier, 93 to 94% in boosting. The features that were determined to be most useful for classification included are related with the pain, analgesics and left uncinate brain (connected with the pain and emotions). Conclusions: The proposed feature selection committee method improved the performance of migraine diagnosis classifiers compared to individual feature selection methods, producing a robust system that achieved over 90% accuracy in all classifiers. The results suggest that the proposed methods can be used to support specialists in the classification of migraines in patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging.	0.1
Background and aims: Gambling disorder-related illegal acts (GDRIA) are often crucial events for gamblers and/or their entourage. This study was designed to determine the predictive factors of GDRIA. Methods: Participants were 372 gamblers reporting at least three DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) criteria. They were assessed on the basis of sociodemographic characteristics, gambling-related characteristics, their personality profile, and psychiatric comorbidities. A multiple logistic regression was performed to identify the relevant predictors of GDRIA and their relative contribution to the prediction of the presence of GDRIA. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed a higher South Oaks Gambling Scale score, comorbid addictive disorders, and a lower level of income as GDRIA predictors. Discussion and conclusion: An original finding of this study was that the comorbid addictive disorder effect might be mediated by a disinhibiting effect of stimulant substances on GDRIA. Further studies are necessary to replicate these results, especially in a longitudinal design, and to explore specific therapeutic interventions.	5.0
Criminal-justice-involved clients often are a complicated population for students to consider through a lens of oppression. Nevertheless, it is critical that they do so given that many will serve clients with criminal records during their careers. An attempt to challenge students' prejudice toward criminal-justiceinvolved people was deployed using a teaching technique derived from intergroup contact theory. The authors invited Juan Melendez to share his story of incarceration on death row for more than 17 years for a crime he did not commit. This article is an examination of the impact of Mr. Melendez's story and the application of intergroup contact theory.	2.0
Cogging torque is a known disadvantage of surface permanent magnet (SPM) machines, especially if equipped with open stator slots. A possible strategy to reduce the cogging torque is to use suitably designed non-isotropic magnetic wedges. The design of such wedges for cogging torque minimization requires a genetic optimization approach. This has been done in previous works using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations to predict the cogging torque for each machine design being explored, leading to a very time consuming optimization process. In this paper, the same optimization is performed using an analytical method to compute the cogging torque. It is shown that the optimization process, based on the analytical formula for cogging torque prediction, leads to the same result as the FEA-based procedure, but with a significant reduction in the computational burden.	3.3
In this paper, we detail two side-channel attacks against the McEliece public-key cryptosystem. They are exploiting timing differences on the Patterson decoding algorithm in order to reveal one part of the secret key: the support permutation. The first one is improving two existing timing attacks and uses the correlation between two different steps of the decoding algorithm. This improvement can be deployed on all error-vectors with Hamming weight smaller than a quarter of the minimum distance of the code. The second attack targets the evaluation of the error locator polynomial and succeeds on several different decoding algorithms. We also give an appropriate countermeasure.	0.3
How do donors reason and justify their choices when faced with dilemmas in a charitable context? In two studies, Swedish students were confronted with helping dilemmas based on the identifiable victim effect, the proportion dominance effect and the ingroup effect. Each dilemma consisted of two comparable charity projects and participants were asked to choose one project over the other. They were then asked to provide justifications of their choice by stating the relative importance of different types of reasons. When faced with an identified victim dilemma, participants did not choose the project including an identified victim more often than the project framed statistically, but those who did emphasized emotional reasons (e.g., Because I had more empathic feelings), but not any other reasons, more than those choosing the statistical project. When faced with a Proportion dominance dilemma, participants more often chose the project with a high rescue proportion (e.g., you can save 100% out of 30) than the project with a low rescue proportion (e.g., you can save 4% out of 800), and those who did emphasized efficacy reasons (e.g., Because my money can make a greater difference there), but no other reasons, more than those favoring the low recue proportion project. Finally, when faced with an Ingroup dilemma, participants more often chose the project that could help ingroup-victims over the project that could help outgroup victims, and those who did emphasized responsibility reasons (e.g., Because I have a greater obligation), but no other reasons, more than those favoring outgroup projects. These results are consistent with and extend previous findings about how different helping effects are related to different psychological processes.	2.4
In recent years environmental sustainability has demanded a progressive increase of waste recycling in general and waste value-added utilisation in the construction industry in particular. As regards the application of construction and demolition wastes (C&DW) in geotechnical works, it has been noticed that the use of recycled aggregates is found mostly in road construction. Value-added utilisation of C&DW in geosynthetic-reinforced structures is almost an unexplored field. This paper presents the results of physical, mechanical and environmental characterisation of recycled C&DW, as well as the direct shear behaviour of three recycled C&DW-geosynthetic interfaces. The C&DW material was collected from a recycling plant and came from the demolition of single-family houses and the cleaning of land with illegal deposits of C&DW. Two geogrids and one geocomposite reinforcement (high-strength geotextile) were used to assess the behaviour of C&DW-geosynthetic interfaces. The environmental characterisation of the C&DW, carried out through leaching tests, did not show environmental concerns. Direct shear test results have demonstrated that properly selected and compacted C&DW can exhibit shear strength similar to natural soils. The coefficients of interaction achieved for C&DW-geosynthetic interfaces compare well with those reported in the literature for soil-geosynthetic interfaces under similar conditions, which supports the feasibility of using these recycled materials as backfill in geosynthetic-reinforced structures.	4.1
Genomic DNA is dynamically associated with protein factors and folded to form chromatin fibers. The 3-dimensional (3D) configuration of the chromatin will enable the distal genetic elements to come into close proximity, allowing transcriptional regulation. Noncoding RNA can mediate the 3D structure of chromatin. Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) is a valuable and powerful technique in molecular biology which allows the study of unbiased, genome-wide de novo chromatin interactions with paired-end tags. Here, we describe the standard version of ChIA-PET and a Multiplex ChIA-PET version.	6.0
Naphthalene sulfonates are highly water-soluble compounds, indicating a high mobility in aquatic systems along with high temperature stability, which are important substances in the chemical industry. This review covers analytical methods, instruments and techniques used for the pre-concentration and analysis of naphthalene sulfonates in different matrices.All analytical steps including the extraction from real samples, their detection by spectrophotometric and chromatographic techniques, as well as methods of identification of this class of compounds are described in detail. The methods normally employed for the extraction and pre-concentration of these compounds is solid-phase extraction (including molecularly imprinted polymers and anion-exchange), while their quantification are performed using high-performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and spectrophotometric techniques. In this review, in addition to chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods, electrochemical innovations appearing in the literature will be also explored.	4.4
A study was undertaken to determine if humans excrete both amobarbital N-glucuronides and N-glucosides in urine after an oral dose of amobarbital. Amobarbital N-glucuronides were synthesized and characterized. A reverse phase LC method using past-column pH adjustment and UV detection at 240 nm was developed and used for the quantification of the amobarbital N-glucosides and N-glucuronides in human urine. Amobarbital was administered orally to seven male subjects and the total urine was collected for a period of 48-53 h after dosing. After filtration, the urine was injected directly onto the HPLC column to analyze for the presence of metabolites. The previously identified (5S)-amobarbital N-glucoside was detected in all seven subjects. The (5R)-amobarbital N-glucoside was detected at lower concentrations in only four of the subjects. At the levels at which amobarbital N-glucosides were detected, there was no evidence for the formation and excretion of the amobarbital N-glucuronides. Amobarbital N-glucuronidation is not a quantitatively significant pathway for the biodisposition of amobarbital in humans. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.	6.2
Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum and is a systemic disease, which can present with variable clinical signs, and clinicopathological abnormalities. Clinical manifestations can range from subclinical infection to very severe systemic disease. Leishmaniosis is categorized as a neglected tropical disease and the complex immune responses associated with Leishmania species makes therapeutic treatments and vaccine development challenging for both dogs and humans. In this review, we summarize innate and adaptive immune responses associated with L. infantum infection in dogs, and we discuss the problems associated with the disease as well as potential solutions and the future direction of required research to help control the parasite.	6.3
Energy storage is unique in that it can provide multiple services. This feature raises cost-recovery issues for storage, due to the combination of competitive markets and ratebased cost recovery used in many power systems today. This hybrid regulatory paradigm relies on classifying assets as providing competitively prices or unpriced services and handling cost recovery based on that classification. Some recent regulatory precedents suggest that storage developers must choose between classifying their assets as providing competitively priced or unpriced services. In the former case, storage costs must be recovered through the market. If an asset is classified as providing only unpriced services, costs can be recovered through the ratebase. This regulatory design can hamper cost recovery for storage and may lead to inefficient storage investment and use. We propose an alternate solution whereby storage-capacity rights are auctioned to third parties that use their rights for priced or unpriced services. Storage-capacity rights disentangle storage cost recovery from the regulatory treatment of its end use. We formulate the storage-capacity auction model and demonstrate how to efficiently price storage-capacity rights. We show that the revenues earned by the storage owner through the auction equals the imputed marginal value of storage capacity, as revealed by the market bids.	1.0
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder mainly showed atypical social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests and activities. Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence. The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in. As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring. Autism Res2017, 0: 000-000.

This study presents a methodology for the estimation of a-priori parameters of the widely used kinematic wave approximation to the unsteady, 1-D Saint-Venant equations for hydrologic flow routing. The approach is based on a multi-dimensional statistical modeling of the macro scale spatial variability of rating curve parameters using a set of geophysical factors including geomorphology, hydro-climatology and land cover/land use over the Conterminous United States. The main goal of this study was to enable prediction at ungauged locations through regionalization of model parameters. The results highlight the importance of regional and local geophysical factors in uniquely defining characteristics of each stream reach conforming to physical theory of fluvial hydraulics. The application of the estimates is demonstrated through a hydrologic modeling evaluation of a deterministic forecasting system performed on 1672 gauged basins and 47,563 events extracted from a 10-year simulation. Considering the mean concentration time of the basins of the study and the target application on flash flood forecasting, the skill of the flow routing simulations is significantly high for peakflow and timing of peakflow estimation, and shows consistency as indicated by the large sample verification. The resulting a-priori estimates can be used in any hydrologic model that employs the kinematic wave model for flow routing. Furthermore, probabilistic estimates of kinematic wave parameters are enabled based on uncertainty information that is generated during the multi-dimensional statistical modeling. More importantly, the methodology presented in this study enables the estimation of the kinematic wave model parameters anywhere over the globe, thus allowing flood modeling in ungauged basins at regional to global scales.

Background: Ocular allergy is a growing public health problem that greatly impacts the day-to-day life of sufferers and their families. Other aspects of their activities of daily living such as schooling, professional, and social life are affected hence an increased awareness and knowledge of ocular allergies, their detection and treatment is paramount. This study was to assess the level of knowledge and awareness of ocular allergy among undergraduate students of public universities in Ghana. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted among 1000 students from three selected public universities in Ghana. Each respondent completed a questionnaire that had questions concerning awareness and knowledge of ocular allergy. Results: Out of the 1000 students, 347 (34.7 %) were aware of ocular allergy. Of these 347 students, the level of knowledge of ocular allergy was generally low. Majority of the students had their source of information about ocular allergy from the media and the internet. There was statistical significant association among awareness of ocular allergy, sources of information and programme of study (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Level of awareness among university students is generally low. Students' programmes of study influenced their knowledge of ocular allergy. Public health measures are recommended to help educate students on the prevention and control of ocular allergy as well as the complications associated with this condition.	5.1
Several laboratory model tests were carried out on the bearing capacity of strip footings on reinforced soil foundation and reinforced slope. Compared with unreinforced cases, the deformation and failure of reinforced earth in different foundation conditions were monitored and analyzed. In order to visualize a failure mechanism when the ground reaches the state of limit equilibrium, a new numerical procedure was proposed. Assuming an elastic-perfectly plastic model, a smeared shear band approach and a modified initial stress method enable the proposed procedure to create an explicit collapse mode by the stress yield condition. On the basis of the development of failure mode and deformation of foundation, the bearing capacity of strip footings can be significantly increased by the inclusion of geotextile. And because the procedure considers the stiffness and deformation of the material, it may be applied to complex stability problems.	4.1
With the rapid development of the Internet, especially the development of mobile Internet, network size and network infrastructure changes, especially the more random access node to detect network attacks challenges traditional detection algorithm using neural networks, so that the calculated volume increased dramatically, and will detection accuracy is not high, for this problem, we use the stochastic process theory hidden Markov chain transformation neural network, so that the convergence of a substantial decline, while improving network attack detection accuracy degree.	0.2
The absorption, metabolism and excretion of desloratadine (DL, Clarinex(R)) were characterized in six healthy male volunteers. Subjects received a single oral 10-mg dose of [C-14]DL (similar to 104 mu Ci). Blood, urine and feces were collected over 240h. DL was well absorbed; drug-derived radioactivity was excreted in both urine (41%) and feces (47%). With the exception of a single subject, DL was extensively metabolized; the major biotransformation pathway consisted of hydroxylation at the 3 position of the pyridine ring and subsequent glucuronidation (3-OH-DL-glucuronide or M13). In five of the six subjects, DL was slowly eliminated (mean t(1/2) = 19.5 h) and persisted in the plasma for 48-120 h post-dose. This is in contrast to a t(1/2) of similar to 110 h and quantifiable plasma DL concentrations for the entire 240-h sampling period in one subject, who was identified phenotypically as a poor metabolizer of DL. This subject also exhibited correspondingly lower amounts of M13 in urine and 3-OH-DL (M40) in feces. Disposition of DL in this subject was characterized by slow absorption, slow metabolism and prolonged elimination. Further clinical studies confirmed the lack of safety issues associated with polymorphism of DL metabolism.	6.2
Objective: To examine the association between postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Medicine and Alzheimer's disease (MEDALZ) is a nested case-control study of the entire Finnish population with clinically verified AD from 2005 to 2011 and up to 4 matched controls per case. This study comprises 230,580 women (46,117 cases and 184,463 controls). Data on HT use from 1995 to 2011 was extracted from the national prescription register using following ATC codes: GO3C (estrogen), GO3D (progestogen) and GO3F (estrogen and progestogen in combination). Only systemic HT (oral or transdermal) was considered. Results: Use of systemic estrogen and progestogen was associated with an increased risk of AD, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.10 (1.06-1.12) and 1.13 (1.10-1.17) respectively, but use of systemic estrogen HT for >10 years (OR, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.84-0.99) was protective against AD. Long-term (>10 years) use of progestogen and combination HT was not related to AD risk (OR, 95% CI: 1.0, 0.90-1.2). Conclusion: Our findings do not suggest HT is an important determinant of AD risk.

Non-uniform flow patterns on distillation trays can result in significant losses in separation efficiency compared to conditions with straight chordal flow paths. To improve flow pattern via tray design revamps as well as for more accurate prediction of achievable separation efficiency, better understanding of the flow formation is required. This is, however, not straight forward since the evolving patterns depend on column and tray design as well as on operating conditions and may cover configurations with continuous liquid being pushed through a curtain of rising bubbles (bubble regime) or a continuous gas phase carrying the liquid as droplets (spray regime). In this study, the wire-mesh sensor technique was used to visualize flow patterns on larger trays. The technique tracks conductivity tracer pulses during their passage across the tray. A proper calibration routine was developed and a methodology is proposed to determine point liquid residence time distributions and weir-to-weir liquid velocities. Experiments were carried out in a tray column of 800 mm diameter. The feasibility study included experiments at different liquid capacities and various outlet weir obstructions. Tray benchmark data at high spatio-temporal resolution were obtained, which are suitable for validation of CFD models for flow simulation of industrial-scale sieve trays.

We examined how ethnic discrimination targeting ethnic minority group members would affect majority group members' attitudes and multiculturalism towards ethnic minority groups in the context of Turkish-Kurdish interethnic conflict. Study 1 (N = 356) demonstrated that the extent to which majorities (Turkish) believed there was ethnic discrimination towards minorities (Kurdish) in the Turkish society was associated with positive outgroup attitudes and support for multiculturalism through decreased levels of perceived threat from the outgroup. Study 2 (N = 82) showed that Turkish participants who read bogus news reports about the prevalence of ethnic discrimination towards the Kurdish were more positive towards this ethnic group (higher levels of support for multiculturalism, culture maintenance, and intergroup contact) compared to participants in the neutral condition. Furthermore, participants who were presented with lower levels of discrimination (few companies have been discriminatory against the Kurdish) were more positive towards Kurdish people than participants who were presented with higher levels of discrimination (most companies have been discriminatory against the Kurdish). Regardless of the intensity of discrimination, information about the prevalence of ethnic discrimination improved majority members' attitudes towards ethnic minority groups. Practical and theoretical implications of the studies were discussed.	2.0
Purpose of review The purpose of the present review is to provide an update on the current development in the field of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNabs) and their potential use in the prevention and therapeutic settings, and an evaluation of the B-cell abnormalities that may impair antibody responses in HIV infection. Recent findings Major advances have been achieved in the characterization of bNabs directed against different vulnerable regions of HIV Envelope (Env). Recent observations have clearly demonstrated the ability of bNabs to prevent HIV infection in the nonhuman primate model of HIV infection and to suppress viremia in individuals with chronic HIV infection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, substantial advances have also been obtained in the development of HIV Env proteins and immunization strategies inducing bNabs in small animal models. Several studies have also shed light on the B-cell abnormalities associated with the viremic phase of HIV infection that cause impaired B-cell maturation and antibody responses. Of note, preliminary observations have provided evidence for a correlation between the expansion of a specific population of B cells, for example, germinal center B cells, the expansion of T follicular helper cells (Tfh), and the generation of neutralizing antibodies. Summary The recent observations on the antiviral effects of bNabs in vivo indicate that bNabs may play a central role in both the prevention and the therapeutic settings. The identification of the role of germinal center B cells and Tfh cells as critical components of the immune response leading to the generation of neutralizing antibodies, will allow the development of specific immunization strategies for the stimulation of germinal center B cells and Tfh cells. A lot of work still remains to be done for the delineation of B-cell and Tfh cell biology from human lymphoid tissues and in the development of HIV Env proteins and immunization strategies leading to the generation of bNabs.	6.1
Objectives: To measure early retirement due to self-reported rheumatic diseases (RDs) and to estimate the respective indirect costs and years of working life lost (YWLL). Methods: We used individual level data from the national, cross-sectional, population based EpiReumaPt study (September 2011 December 2013) where 10,661 inhabitants were randomly surveyed in order to capture and characterize all cases of RD within a representative sample of the Portuguese population. In this analysis, we used all participants aged between 50 and 64 years, near the official retirement age. A national database was used to calculate productivity values by gender, age and region, using the human capital approach. YWLL were estimated as the difference between each participant's current age and the respective retirement age, while the potential years of working life lost (PYWLL) were given by the difference between official and actual retirement ages. We also calculated the percentage of time in inactivity (inactivity ratio = YWLL/Active age-range [15-64 years old]). Results: 29.9% of the Portuguese population with ages between 50 and 64 years were retired with 13.1% self-reporting retirement due to RD. The estimated annual indirect cost following premature retirement attributed to RD was (sic)910 million ((sic)555 per capita; (sic)1625 per self-reported RD patient and (sic)13,592 per early retiree due to RD). Females contributed with 84% for these costs ((sic)766 million; (sic)882 per capita vs (sic)187 from males). We observed a total number of 389,939 accumulated YWLL (228 per 1000 inhabitants) and 684,960 PYWLL (401 per 1000 inhabitants). The mean YWLL and PYWLL inactivity ratios were 12% and 21%, respectively. RD patients with higher values of disability have the highest risk of early retirement. Conclusions: Early retirement attributed to self-reported RD amounts to approximately 0.5% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013, due to large YWLL. Both the public health concern and the economic impact highlight the need to prioritize investments in health and social protection policies targeting patients with rheumatic conditions.

Advanced grammar courses often present standardized grammar rules to students without considering sociolinguistic variation. As a result, many native/heritage students feel that they speak incorrectly, and many second language learners do not get an accurate picture of the target language's real-world grammar. This article describes and evaluates a unique approach to teaching advanced Spanish grammar to university students. The curriculum focuses on core grammatical content by studying structures that are subject to sociolinguistic variation, as in habia approximate to habian dos ranas [there was approximate to were two frogs], and it highlights the sociopolitical factors that explain why some forms are deemed prestigious. To test the efficacy of this curriculum, students enrolled in an advanced Spanish grammar course at a large university in the southwestern United States completed a pre- and posttest that measured Spanish grammar knowledge, awareness of sociolinguistic concepts, and positive language attitudes. Results showed statistically significant gains with respect to knowledge of grammar and sociolinguistics. Students also demonstrated a heightened awareness of how prejudice can manifest in judgments of spoken language.	2.0
In all kinds of Internet security incidents, the most serious is malicious code. The increasingly serious problem caused by malicious code, not only make the enterprises and users suffered huge economic losses, but also makes network security facing serious threat. In this paper, based on the analysis of malicious code detection technology and detection system, the author designs and implements an unknown malicious code detection system based on network behavior analysis. Test results show that the detection system can distinguish three kinds of ARP attack; it can produce normal alarm information and achieve the desired results. At the same time, the network behavior analysis method needs to be further improved in order to achieve better analysis results, and provide more reliable results for the detection system.	0.2
In the present work we compare the results obtained by two approaches to detect receptor expression on cells surface: (i) the confocal laser scanning microscopy, which is an established methodology to study cell biology and associated events, wherein the cells or molecules labeling is needed, and (ii) an alternative label-free electroanalytical technique, essentially quantitative, based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Concerning specificity, both assays are equivalent, since they depend on the antibody efficiency to recognize and discriminate the searched structure in the cell context. Regarding sensitivity, we showed that, in the case of the detection of Toll-like receptor on transfected human cells, this label-free EIS approach (with measurements performed on 2% of paraformaldehyde, an environment that retained morphology and antigenic sites of cells), was very sensitive for the receptor detection, in a demonstration that the proposed electrical impedance analytical assays can help optimizing the ability to evaluate cellular biological events. It provides to biologists and medical community an alternative and either quantitive analytical tool that can be applied to the biological model of interest and used to design and perform a rapid multiplexable and automatable assaying methodology.

This paper presents a novel multiphase permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous machinery series adopting two adjacent coils per phase and modular stator. Machine design principles, including modular stator design, segmental interior PM-assisted rotor design, and winding factor improvement, are investigated. Moreover, analytical modeling of winding inductance is developed to provide insights into the magnetic circuit of this type of machine. The proposed machinery series is suitable for wheel-driving electric vehicles attributing to their high magnetic isolation feature, good flux-weakening capability, and feasibility of modular fabrication.	3.3
As a primary disposal mean of municipal solid waste in China, the landfill has been recognized as one of the major threats to the surrounding surface water and groundwater environment due to the emission of leachate. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of leachate on the surface water and groundwater environment of the region of the Chang'an landfill, which is located in Sichuan province, China. The surface water and groundwater were sampled for hydrochemical analysis. Three electrical resistivity tomography profiles were conducted to evaluate the impact of leachate on the groundwater environment, and several laboratory tests were carried out to build the relationship between the soil bulk resistivity and the void fluid resistivity. The results showed that a seasonal creek named Longfeng creek, which crosses the landfill site, was contaminated by the leachate. The concentrations of COD, BOD5, and chlorides (Cl) of surface water samples increased by 12.3-105.7 times. The groundwater quality in the surface loose sediments along the valley deteriorated obviously from the landfill to 500 m downstream area. The laboratory tests of soil samples indicated that the resistivity value of 13 Omega m is a critical value whether the groundwater in the loose sediments is polluted. The groundwater at the site adjacent to the spillway in the landfill was partially contaminated by the emission of leachate. The groundwater contamination zones at 580 m downstream of the landfill were recognized at the shallow zones from 60 m left bank to 30 m right bank of Longfeng creek. The improved understanding of groundwater contamination around the landfill is beneficial for the landfill operation and groundwater environment remediation.	4.4
A major topic of interest in human prehistory is how the large-scale genetic structure of modern populations outside of Africa was established. Demographic models have been developed that capture the relationships among small numbers of populations or within particular geographical regions, but constructing a phylogenetic tree with gene flow events for a wide diversity of non-Africans remains a difficult problem. Here, we report a model that provides a good statistical fit to allele-frequency correlation patterns among East Asians, Australasians, Native Americans, and ancient western and northern Eurasians, together with archaic human groups. The model features a primary eastern/western bifurcation dating to at least 45,000 years ago, with Australasians nested inside the eastern clade, and a parsimonious set of admixture events. While our results still represent a simplified picture, they provide a useful summary of deep Eurasian population history that can serve as a null model for future studies and a baseline for further discoveries.	6.4
Delayed Resonators (DR) refer to a special type of active vibration absorber system. An intentionally delayed feedback control is used to bring an absorber sub-structure to resonance, in turn canceling vibrations in the primary structure. So far, this theory has been applied to traditional mechanical vibration absorbers with proof masses. This study proposes a new venue for DR-based vibration control using piezoelectric networks. The inherent electro-mechanical coupling of piezoelectric materials has enabled the use of electrical circuits to absorb vibrations in mechanical structures. The DR principles are applied here to create a resonating electrical circuit which offers ideal vibration absorption performance. Experimental studies are also presented to demonstrate the results.

Brown and beige adipose tissue may represent important therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes and obesity as these organs dissipate nutrient energy as heat through the thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). While mice are commonly used to mimic the potential effects of brown/beige adipose tissue that may act in human metabolism, new animal models are edging into the market for translational medicine. Pigs reflect human metabolism better than mice in multiple parameters such as obesity-induced hyperglycemia, cholesterol profiles and energy metabolism. Recently, it was reported that energy expenditure and body temperature in pigs is induced by the hormone leptin, and that leptin's action is mediated by UCP1 in adipose tissue. Given the tremendous importance of identifying molecular mechanisms for targeting therapeutics, we critically examine the evidence supporting the presence of UCP1 in pigs and conclude that methodological shortcomings prevent an unequivocal claim for the presence of UCP1 in pigs. Despite this, we believe that leptin's effects on energy expenditure in pigs are potentially more transformative to human medicine in the absence of UCP1, as adult and obese humans possess only minor amounts of UCP1. In general, we propose that the biology of new animal models requires attention to comparative studies with humans given the increasing amount of genomic information for various animal species.

The paper presents a specialized application containing its own algorithms for reduction functions, changing the length of chain, generating Rainbow Tables and measuring the effectivity of the password search in detail. Within the executed tests, the dependence of Rainbow Tables size on the password length, the affection of the hash search by the size of the chosen chain and their links to collisions, which arise from the principle of using the reduction function, were observed. The results objectively describe the pros and cons of using Rainbow Tables and show the possibilities and restrictions for their effective usage.	0.2
Objective: To investigate whether risperidone improves social cognitive impairments and executive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia. Methods: Fifty-six patients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were allocated to a risperidone treatment group (RTG, n= 28) and a typical antipsychotic treatment group (TATG, n= 28). Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were recruited as the normal control group (NCG). The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Interpersonal Perception Task-15 (IPT-15), and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were rated at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment with risperidone or typical antipsychotics. Results: Risperidone and typical antipsychotics decreased Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores for total psychopathology and positive and negative symptoms. At baseline, in the IPT-15, total scores and five factor scores, as well as the number of categories completed and the percentage of conceptual level responses, were significantly lower in the RTG and TATG than in the NCG, whereas total response errors, perseverative errors, and failure to maintain set were significantly higher in the patient groups than in the NCG. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of time period (baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks) for IPT-15 scores and WCST performances, and significant interactions for time period x group (RTG and TATG). Multivariate analysis of variance showed no significant differences between the RTG and TATG on IPT-15 scores at 4 weeks, but there were significant differences between these two groups at 12 weeks. Significant differences were also found between the RTG and TATG on WCST performances at 4 and 12 weeks. Conclusion: Individuals with schizophrenia have impairments in social cognitive and executive function, which might be improved by risperidone.	2.1
Objective: The objective of this study was the identification of the stain HIF-alpha using the Image Cytometry, and to help to count the positive cells (with HIF-alpha) and the negative cells (without HIF-alpha) from the same sample. Method: 17 images of renal tissues from male rats of Winstar lineage; overall, there were 12.587 objects (cells) in the images for analysis. The acquired images were then analyzed through the free softwares CellProfiler (version 2.1.1) and CellProfiler Analyst (version 2.0). In the software CellProfiler Anlyst, there was a separation with the classes of the object, using a classifier, and the classes were: 1) class with HIF-alpha and 2) class without HIF-alpha. Results: With the data obtained through Score All, it was possible to calculate the percentage of cells that had HIFalpha; out of 12.587 objects of the sample, 6.773 (54%) had HIF-alpha and 5.814 (46%) did not have HIF-alpha. Data of sensibility 0.90, specificity 0.84 and standard deviation 0.10 and 0.12. Conclusion: The research shows that the free software CellProfiler, through the light microscope, was able to identify the stains, perform the machine's learning, and subsequently count and separate cells from distinct classes (with and without the stain of HIF-alpha).

The ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coils are required not to quench during the most demanding event: a plasma disruption followed by a fast discharge of the Central Solenoid (CS), the Poloidal Field (PF) coils and the Correction Coils (CC). This event creates large heat deposition in the ITER magnet stainless steel structures in addition to the conductor AC losses. In order to prevent quench occurring in the TF conductor, cooling channels, implemented in the TF coil structure (TFCS), have to remove a large fraction of the heat deposited. The first integrated TF and structure mock-up has been manufactured and then tested in the HELIOS cryogenic test facility (CEA Grenoble) to determine the thermal coupling between the TFCS and the TF conductor, both actively cooled by supercritical helium at 4.4 K and 5 bar. It consists in a stainless steel casing, a cooling pipe glued with resin in the casing groove, winding pack (WP) ground insulation, a radial plate and a copper dummy cable-in-conduit-conductor (CICC). Steady state as well as transient thermal characterizations have been completed in May 2015. Simulation results by thermal hydraulic codes (VENECIA/SuperMagnet) and some of the experimehtal data are presented and discussed. The thermal coupling between the helium in the cooling tube and the TF coil structure is then modelled as an equivalent heat transfer coefficient in order to simplify the thermal hydraulic (TH) models. Comparison between simplified coupling and detailed coupling is presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.1
This paper mainly discussed the novel open experiment graduate course in electronic information and engineering. The course is designed to teach postgraduates how to design, test, and simulate some basic experiments related to wireless communication systems and microwave transmission systems using modern instruments and computer-aided design ( CAD) software. One of the objectives of the course is to assist postgraduates to understand the theoretical concepts of wireless systems, parallel DSP, embedded systems, electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic compatibility and optical communication systems through hands-on experiments and to make them more confident both in system design and analysis. The course also aims at increasing the interest of postgraduates in engineering and technology. Therefore, laboratory experiments that are complementary to the materials discussed in the theoretical part of the course are designed specifically to incorporate the use of several common instruments that students probably use extensively in their research fields. Complementing and expanding upon the materials covered in six basic courses is another merit of this laboratory-based course. Meeting the course requirements also helps students improve their oral presentation and report preparation abilities. The laboratory has provided more than 2000 postgraduates during the past ten years with the opportunity to acquire both in-depth theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in this rapidly growing discipline. The evaluation of the course indicates that most of the objectives are achieved.	3.0

The machine runs on a single phase three horse power electric motor at a speed of 1450 rpm. Due to the inherent problems of contamination the machine may be adopted for large scale industrial applications.	3.3
In this study, we evaluated the performance of community land surface model (CLM4.5) to simulate the hydrologic fluxes, such as, soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET) and runoff with (without) remote sensing data assimilation. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR_E) daily SM (both ascending and descending) are incorporated into the CLM4.5 model using data assimilation (DA) technique. The GLDAS data is used to validate the AMSR_E SM data and evaluate the performance of CLM4.5 simulations. The AMSR_E SM data are rescaled to meet the resolution of CLM4.5 model. By assimilating the AMSRE SM data into the CLM4.5 model can improve the SM simulations, especially over the climate transition zones in Africa, East Australia, South South America, Southeast Asia, and East North America in summer season. The Local Ensemble Kalman Filter (LEnKF) technique improves the performance of CLM4.5 model compared to the directly substituted method. The improvement in ET and surface runoff simulations from CLM4.5 model assimilated with AMSR_E SM data shares similar spatial patterns with SM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.2
Catering for children with food allergies in school canteens falls entirely within the ambit of the Individualised Meal Project (PAD. Although national educational staff enjoy the support of medical personnel, canteen staff to prepare and occasionally package meals, are employed by local authorities and thus only rarely undergo training in good practices in catering for children with food allergies. The Franche-Comte and Ecology Network (Menu d'allergologie de Franche-comTe RAFT) has created and now proposes training for such staff. The present article sets out the methodology of the course, the tools developed, and its evaluation. To date, 23 training sessions have been conducted in the region, and have enabled training of 439 staff members, from institutions dealing with small children to secondary schools. The evaluation questionnaire comprising 11 questions enabling the collection of spontaneous comments, was sent out to 127 of the primary school staff who underwent training. Sixty-one questionnaires (48%) were completed. The majority of staff answering the questionnaire indicated that they had acquired new knowledge, in particular regarding allergen labeling. They have a greater working knowledge of the procedures recommended under the PAI. They felt themselves to be better prepared in catering for children with food allergies. They had a better understanding of the various people involved and after their training, they were able to cater more successfully for children with food allergies without offering separate meals for this population. The success of this project was partly due to the creation of a training course developed over time, with the complete involvement of the actors concerned and within an institutional framework. Further training sessions have been scheduled, and these will be given by RAFT staff members. A partnership programme will soon enable this action to be extended to the entire Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region. It is our hope that the experience acquired in this project may soon be utilised by other regions. (C)2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.	5.1
The arrival of the information age has gradually expanded the practical application of computer networks, provided more convenience for people's lives, and promoted the rapid development of Chinese information industry. In this situation, the process of using computer network has gradually produced network security problems, affected the security of the user's personal information. Affected by various illegal attacks will bury a large security risks to popularization and use of computer network, indirectly reduce the efficiency of a variety of information security transmission, restrict the future level of network services. In order to change the current situation of the development of adverse, we need to pay attention to the rational use of network security technology, structure reliability computer network defense mechanism, enhance the safety performance of network. This will maximize to meet the actual needs of users. Based on this, this paper will carry on the systematic elaboration to the security technology in the computer network.	0.2
The switched reluctance machine (SRM) offers advantages over other topologies, but low torque density, high torque ripple, and use of a nonstandard power converter are limitations. This paper develops a drive configuration, which facilitates the operation of a six-phase SRM using a standard three-phase inverter in order to address these limitations. The focus of the paper is an investigation of electromagnetic design aspects of two candidate SRM topologies in this six-phase context for a pure electric or hybrid electric vehicle-type application. Advances are made in the understanding of the electromagnetic design of suitable SRMs, and the conventional SRM is demonstrated as the preferred topology through parametric and finite-element analysis (FEA) design studies with reference to a given specification. Laboratory test results for a prototype machine are presented in verification of the machine design and demonstration of this drive concept as a high-torque-density candidate suitable for electric vehicle applications.	3.3
An assembly design system is an important part of computer-aided design systems, which are important tools for realizing product concept design. The traditional assembly design system does not record the connection information of production on the engineering layer; consequently, the upstream design idea cannot be fully used in the downstream design. An assembly design model based on the relationship of engineering connection is presented. In this model, all nodes are divided into two categories: The component and the connection. Moreover, the product is constructed on the basis of the connection relationship of the components. The model is an And/Or graph and has the ability to record all assembly schemes. This model records only the connection information that has engineering application value in the product design. In addition, this model can significantly reduce the number of combinations, and is very favorable for the assembly sequence planning in the downstream. The system contains a connection knowledge system that can be mapped to the connection node, and the connection knowledge obtained in practice can be returned to the knowledge system. Finally, VC++6.0 is used to develop a prototype system called Connect-based Assembly Planning (CAP). The relationship between the CAP system and the commercial assembly design system is also established.	3.0
Individuals can apply different processing strategies to deal with situations they encounter. One central question in social-cognition research refers to the factors that determine reliance on different processing strategies. Parting from a functional perspective, which holds that processing strategies need to be adjusted to the requirements of the situation, we argue that individuals' mood carries information about the benign versus problematic nature of the situation and thus that mood can regulate cognitive processing. Focusing on mental abstraction, we propose that positive mood contributes to a processing style characterized by reliance on prior knowledge in the form of general knowledge structures, whereas negative mood elicits a processing style characterized by attention to details and consideration of new situation-specific information.	2.1
Increasing quality requirements for functional sports-and work wear make their development more demanding as complex interaction between human physiology and clothing is to be taken adequately into account. Previous test designs, often based on subjective perceptions, make a convincing comparison difficult. Material-specific laboratory tests only offer limited validity regarding effects on physiological and ergonomic properties. Principal objective of the study is to compare two different types of down jackets with respect to their effect on core body temperature during physical activity and inactivity. Both jackets were filled with different lining, one with chemically modified down called QuixDown (QD), the other one with conventional down (CD). A climatic chamber test with two activity sessions and a break in between was performed. Subjects were physically active on a bike ergometer at moderate level. A total of n = 26 (12m, 14f) healthy and physically active subjects between 18 and 35 years of age were randomly divided into control (CG) and treatment group (TG). TG was equipped with the QD, control group with the CD jacket. To ensure identical loading intensity for the test the individual anaerobic threshold of each subject had been determined in a pretest. Each person was equipped with an in-ear thermometer for measuring the core body temperature at the acoustic meatus. With QD jacket the subject's core body temperature dropped less during the break between both activity sessions than when wearing the CD jacket (p < 0.05, omega(2) = 0.124). No statistical significance could be shown in gender (p = 0.22, omega(2) = 0.02) and interaction jacket/gender (p = 0.56, omega(2) approximate to 0). The chemically modified down insulation seems to offer better thermal insulation than conventional down. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and concussion are terms often used interchangeably. However, mTBI is frequently seen as representing a broader injury that encompasses the construct of concussion, which often conveys transience or decreased severity. The present study examined the influence of varying diagnostic terminology on acute injury expectations in an undergraduate population (N=105). Participants were presented with an mTBI vignette and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in which the term mTBI or concussion was used to describe the injury. There were no significant differences between the two conditions on anxiety, symptomatology, timeline, or consequence scales. However, participants in the mTBI group allocated more days to return to play than participants in the concussion group, suggesting that terminology has an effect on perceptions of the severity of the injury. Varsity athletes allocated fewer days to return to play than nonathletes. Individuals with a history of concussion, both athletes and nonathletes, indicated fewer days to return to play, but greater symptomatology than individuals with no history of concussion. Clinicians should consider the influence of diagnostic terminology, athletic background, and history of concussion on perceptions of the severity of an injury because expectations can influence injury outcomes and compliance in a recovery process.	5.4
Background: Inferring the ancestry of each region of admixed individuals' genomes is useful in studies ranging from disease gene mapping to speciation genetics. Current methods require high-coverage genotype data and phased reference panels, and are therefore inappropriate for many data sets. We present a software application, AD-LIBS, that uses a hidden Markov model to infer ancestry across hybrid genomes without requiring variant calling or phasing. This approach is useful for non-model organisms and in cases of low-coverage data, such as ancient DNA. Results: We demonstrate the utility of AD-LIBS with synthetic data. We then use AD-LIBS to infer ancestry in two published data sets: European human genomes with Neanderthal ancestry and brown bear genomes with polar bear ancestry. AD-LIBS correctly infers 87-91% of ancestry in simulations and produces ancestry maps that agree with published results and global ancestry estimates in humans. In brown bears, we find more polar bear ancestry than has been published previously, using both AD-LIBS and an existing software application for local ancestry inference, HAPMIX. We validate AD-LIBS polar bear ancestry maps by recovering a geographic signal within bears that mirrors what is seen in SNP data. Finally, we demonstrate that AD-LIBS is more effective than HAPMIX at inferring ancestry when preexisting phased reference data are unavailable and genomes are sequenced to low coverage. Conclusions: AD-LIBS is an effective tool for ancestry inference that can be used even when few individuals are available for comparison or when genomes are sequenced to low coverage. AD-LIBS is therefore likely to be useful in studies of non-model or ancient organisms that lack large amounts of genomic DNA. AD-LIBS can therefore expand the range of studies in which admixture mapping is a viable tool.	6.4
Wavelet analysis was applied to detect the greatest deviation from the perfect circle for the roundness and cylindricalness of shaft-like components in the virtual manufacturing engineering. Based on the concepts of the roundness and cylindricalness, the least square method was adopted into the determination of the reference-the least square circle from which the deviation was calculated. In order to obtain the extremum of the errors, wavelet transform was carried out with binary wavelet from the time domain to frequency domain. A virtual probe was used to have the signals for the measured point by using WTnode_gettranslation() function. The accuracy of the measurement depends, to a large extent, on the length of individual step along the axis and the density of the measured points on the sections. Experiments have shown that the measuring processing was time-saving and the results from the wavelet analysis were much reliable.	3.2
The endocannabinoid signaling plays a critical role in mediating rewarding effects to morphine. The relative stability for the expression and reinstatement of morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) suggests the involvement of differential neuroadaptations in learned associations between environmental cues and morphine. Changes in gene expression in hippocampus through the endogenous cannabinoid system (eCB) may accompany and mediate the development of such neuroadaptations to repeated morphine stimulation. To test this possibility, we systematically compared the expression of eCB-related genes in the dorsal hippocampus following the expression, extinction, and reinstatement of morphine CPP using quantitative RT-PCR analyses. We found that expression of morphine CPP was associated with significant increases in mRNA expression for the primary clearance routes for anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG (fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH] and monoacylglycerol lipase [MAGL], respectively), but with reductions in cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1R) and CB2R in dorsal hippocampus following the expression of CPP. However, our results indicated that decreased in MAGL and increased CB1R mRNA levels were accompanied with morphine CPP reinstatement. No significant changes in mRNA expression for enzymes involved in AEA and 2-AG biosynthesis (N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D [NAPEPLD] and diacylglycerol lipase-alpha/beta [DAGLet/f3], respectively) were found in all conditions. These results suggest that differential regulation of the synthesis and/or degradation of the eCB system contribute to the expression and reinstatement of morphine CPP. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Hepatitis A virus is one of five types of hepatotropic viruses that cause human liver disease. A similar liver disease is also identified in ducks caused by Duck Hepatitis A virus (DHAV). Notably, many types of hepatotropic viruses can be detected in urine. However, how those viruses enter into the urine is largely unexplored. To elucidate the potential mechanism, we used the avian hepatotropic virus to investigate replication strategies and immune responses in kidney until 280 days after infection. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to detect viral distribution and copies in the kidney. Double staining of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and virus and qPCR were used to investigate T cell immune responses and expression levels of cytokines. Histopathology was detected by standard HE staining. In this study, viruses were persistently located at scattered renal tubules. No CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were recruited to the kidney, which was only accompanied by transient cytokine storms. In conclusion, the extremely scattered infection was the viral strategy to escape host immunity and may persistently shed virus into urine. The deletion of Th or Tc cell responses and transient cytokine storms indeed provide an advantageous renal environment for their persistent survival.	6.3
We tested the effectiveness of the preventive behavioral parent training (BPT) program, The Incredible Years (IY), and the independent effects of previously suggested socio-demographic and intervention-based moderator variables (i.e., initial severity of externalizing problem behavior, child gender, social economic status, family composition, and number of sessions parents attended), in a large-scale randomized controlled trial. Questionnaire and observation data from 387 parents and children ages 4-8 years (M-age = 6.21, SD = 1.33, 55.30% boys) across pretest, posttest, and 4-month follow-up were analyzed, using full intention-to-treat analyses and correcting for multiple testing. IY was successful in decreasing parent-reported child externalizing behavior (Cohen's d = 0.20 at posttest, d = 0.08 at follow-up), increasing parent-reported (d = 0.49, d = 0.45) and observed (d = 0.06, d = 0.02) positive parenting behavior, and decreasing parent-reported negative parenting behavior (d = 0.29, d = 0.25). No intervention effects were found for reported and observed child prosocial behavior, observed child externalizing behavior, and observed negative parenting behavior. Out of 40 tested moderation effects (i.e., 8 Outcomes x 5 Moderators), only three significant moderation effects appeared. Thus, no systematic evidence emerged for moderation of IY effects. The present multi-informant trial demonstrated that many previously suggested moderators might not be as potent in differentiating BPT effects as once thought.	2.4
Despite health and safety legislation and ergonomics regulations for several years many Swedish companies are still unable to effectively prevent the consequences of poor ergonomics. Corrective measures are often made (too) late when employees complain and work-related disorders have already occurred. Besides, several studies have shown that poor ergonomics result in deteriorated assembly quality and reduced productivity and that late measures are often costly. Other studies have proven that design engineers are often unaware of design consequences and do not know how to apply ergonomics principles in new product and production design. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore what is required to improve the situation. One way to find out was to ask engineers involved in product and production development. Thus, 64 engineers in design and manufacturing engineering in five Swedish companies were interviewed about ergonomics conditions related to quality and productivity issues. In general, their answers unexpectedly demonstrated a fairly good awareness of the implications of poor assembly ergonomics but also that appropriate product and production design methods and tools to prevent these are missing. 58 of the respondents thought that poor ergonomics could result in reduced product quality. 47 stated that profitability calculations are necessary for changes of poor ergonomic solutions. 37 said that ergonomics risks are accepted due to lack of appropriate calculation methods. Altogether, many suggestions emerged for how to improve product and production design methods and tools in order to achieve more complete and sustainable manufacturing solutions. Relevance to industry: The relationship between ergonomics and assembly quality deserves more attention in order to achieve both good working conditions and sustainable and cost-efficient manufacturing solutions. Assembly ergonomics and quality relationships must therefore be proactively considered already in early design phases of new product and assembly concepts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Clear identification of areas vulnerable to waterborne diseases is essential for protecting community health. This is particularly important in developing countries where unsafe disposal of domestic wastewater and limited potable water supply pose potential public health risks. However, data paucity can be a compounding issue. Under these circumstances, landscape epidemiology can be applied as a resource efficient approach for mapping potential disease risk areas associated with poor sanitation. However, in order to realise the full potential offered by this approach, an in-depth understanding of the impact of different classes of an explanatory variable on a target disease and the validity of hotspot analysis using limited datasets is needed. Accordingly, this research study focused on typhoid and diarrhoea incidence with respect to different classes of elevation, flood inundation, land use, soil permeability, population density and rainfall as explanatory variables. An integrated methodology consisting of hot spot analysis and Poisson regression was employed to map potential disease risk areas. The study findings confirmed the significant differences in the influence exerted by the various classes of an explanatory variable in relation to a target disease. The results also confirmed the feasibility of the hotspot analysis for identifying areas vulnerable to the target diseases using a limited dataset. The study outcomes are expected to contribute to creating an in-depth understanding of the relationship between disease prevalence and associated landscape factors for the delineation of disease risk zones in the context of data paucity.

As a result of the development of internet and ICT (information-centric technology) advances including mobile, cloud, social networking, big data, multimedia and the tendency towards digital society, the management and configuration of them have become highly complex, challenging and time consuming. Also, access to high bandwidth, extendibility and dynamic management are of critical significance, especially when network devices are vertically integrated. Hence, a set of unique predefined line commands and operating systems or firmware should be used. SDN (software-defined networking) is a structure designed for simplifying and improving network management with high flexibility by splitting control plane and data plane. Thus, network programmability is enhanced which in turn leads to more innovation opportunities. Although SDN is regarded as a new research issue, it has attracted numerous researchers' attention from both industrial and academic institutes. In this paper, data plane, control plane and application plane as the three planes of SDN and the interfaces between them such as OpenFlow are investigated and the challenges and the latest technologies in relation to SDN are examined. The investigation and overview of SDN reported in this paper might be used by the interested future researchers to better understand and apply SDN in real-life applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa has led to more than 11,000 deaths, with a peak in mortality from August through December of 2014. A meeting convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) in September 2014, concluded that an urgent unmet need exists for efficacy and safety testing of the Ebola virus vaccine candidates and that clinical trials should be expedited. These vaccines could be used both in an outbreak setting and to provide long-term protection in populations at risk of sporadic outbreaks. A number of vaccines have been evaluated in phase 1 trials, but the two most advanced first-generation Ebola vaccine candidates are the live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) and the replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3). This review focuses on these two vaccines in clinical development and discusses the future opportunities and challenges faced in the licensure and deployment of Ebola virus vaccines.

Individual differences in visuo-spatial factors play an important part in environment learning when it comes to mentally representing environments, but little is known about how visuo-spatial factors (in terms of abilities and self-assessments) are related to an individual's representations of familiar environments. A group of 273 female undergraduates familiar with a university campus completed object-based visuo-spatial tasks (i.e., mental rotation and visuo-spatial working memory [VSWM] tasks), and questionnaires on their self-assessed wayfinding inclinations (i.e., sense of direction, visuo-spatial preferences, pleasure in exploring environments), and their spatial anxiety. Their spatial orientation performance was assessed with landmark locating and pointing tasks. The results of structural equation modeling showed that object-based visuo-spatial abilities and self-assessed wayfinding inclinations were related with spatial orientation performance. In particular, it was postulated that object-based visuo-spatial abilities (where rotation had an indirect effect through VSWM) and self assessed wayfinding inclinations support spatial orientation performance. Spatial anxiety was only related to self-assessed wayfinding inclinations. Overall, these results show that a set of different individual visuo-spatial factors have a role in the representation of a familiar environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.4
This paper presents the results of laboratory model tests carried out on embedded square footing supported on geotextile reinforced sand bed. The effect of reinforcement with geotextile were studies through a series of laboratory model tests with different size of geotextile and depth of placement below footing. The effects of prestressing the geotextile on the strength improvement and settlement reduction of a reinforced sand bed are also being investigated. The model steel tank of size 120 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm and square footing of 10 cm are used. The study also highlights the effect of size of geotextile and placement of geotextile below footing on load-settlement characteristics.	4.1
Proximity detection systems are actively being marketed to the underground mining section as a way to provide enhanced information for operators of large underground machinery. To date, many of the systems are lacking the reliability and validity ratings that researchers would like to see them have. Due to this, they may not interact in a predictable way to always improve operator awareness. In fact, Burgess Limerick (2011) noted that in many fatalities that occurred on underground machinery, the operator was aware of the location of the victim, or they were the victim themselves. This work recreates one of the accidents from that review in a computer simulation environment, models a video-based proximity detection system and then evaluates the capacity of the system to improve operator line of sight. Results demonstrate that there was only a small window of time during which the operator may have been able to see the victim's location even with a hypothetical camera system installed. The work points to the importance that mine design and machine design have with respect to improving safety of the worker, as well as the downfalls of existing proximity detection systems that rely on video feeds mounted to the machinery.

Advances in forensic identification using molecular genetics are helpful in resolving some historical mysteries. The aim of this study was to confirm the authenticity of shrunken-head artifacts exhibited by two Polish museums. Shrunken heads, known as tsantsas, were headhunting trophies of South American Indians (Jivaroan). A special preparation preserved their hair and facial appearance. However, it was quite common to offer counterfeit shrunken heads of sloths or monkeys to collectors of curiosities. We sampled small skin specimens of four shrunken-head skin from the museum collection from Warsaw and Krakow, Poland. Following genomic DNA isolation, highly polymorphic short tandem repeats were genotyped using a commercial chemistry and DNA sequencing analyzer. Haplogroups of human Y chromosome were identified. We obtained an informative genetic profile of genomic short tandem repeats from all the samples of shrunken heads. Moreover, amplification of amelogenin loci allowed for sex determination. All four studied shrunken heads were of human origin. In two ones, a shared Y-chromosome haplogroup Q characteristic for Indigenous Americans was detected. Another artifact was counterfeited because Y-chromosome haplogroup I2 was found, characteristic for the Southeastern European origin. Commercial genetic methods of identification can be applied successfully in studies on the origin and authenticity of some unusual collection items.	6.4
Natural killer cells were first described over 40 years ago, but the last 15 years has shown tremendous progress in our understanding of their biology and our ability to manipulate them for clinical therapeutic effect. Despite the increased understanding by clinicians and scientists investigating these cells, their biology remains a confusing subject for many because of the wide array of receptors, complex interactions, multiple models of predicting function, and contradictory data in the literature. While they are microscopically indistinguishable from T cells and share many of the same effector functions, their mechanisms of target recognition are completely distinct from yet complimentary to T cells. In this review we provide a basic understanding of NK cell biology and HLA recognition as compared and contrasted to T cells using a metaphor of border patrol and passports. We conclude with a summary of the evidence for NM cell effects in hematologic malignancies and describe new advances in NM cell immunotherapy aimed at improving these effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Watching contact between members of one's ingroup and members of an outgroup in the media (mediated vicarious contact) improves intergroup attitudes. We compare mediated vicarious contact with observing only members of the outgroup (parasocial contact), and examine whether the activity of the portrayed contact matters. Building on theory, we predict that watching outgroup members playing music should reduce prejudice more than watching them engaged in nonmusical activities, particularly with vicarious (vs. parasocial) contact. Results show that vicarious musical contact enhances perceptions of synchronization, liking, and honesty between ingroup and outgroup actors in a video, which in turn results in more positive attitudes toward the outgroup. Counter to predictions, parasocial musical contact results in less positive outcomes than parasocial nonmusical contact.	2.0
Background Studies of children with food allergy typically only include the mother and have not investigated the relationship between the amount of allergen needed to elicit a clinical reaction (threshold) and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Our aims were (i) to compare self-reported and parent-reported HRQL in different age groups, (ii) to evaluate the impact of severity of allergic reaction and threshold on HRQL, and (iii) to investigate factors associated with patient-reported and parent-reported HRQL. Methods Age-appropriate Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaires (FAQLQ) were completed by 73 children, 49 adolescents and 29 adults with peanut, hazelnut or egg allergy. Parents (197 mothers, 120 fathers) assessed their child's HRQL using the FAQLQ-Parent form. Clinical data and threshold values were obtained from a hospital database. Significant factors for HRQL were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression. Results Female patients reported greater impact of food allergy on HRQL than males did. Egg and hazelnut thresholds did not affect HRQL, but lower peanut threshold was associated with worse HRQL. Both parents scored their child's HRQL better than the child's own assessment, but whereas mother-reported HRQL was significantly affected by limitations in the child's social life, father-reported HRQL was affected by limitations in the family's social life. Severity of allergic reaction did not contribute significantly to HRQL. Conclusion The risk of accidental allergen ingestion and limitations in social life are associated with worse HRQL. Fathers provide a unique perspective and should have a greater opportunity to contribute to food allergy research.	6.3
Purpose of reviewCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is one of the commonest inherited neuromuscular diseases with a population prevalence of 1 in 2500. This review will cover recent advances in the genetics and pathomechanisms of CMT and how these are leading to the development of rational therapies.Recent findingsPathomechanistic and therapeutic target advances in CMT include the identification of the ErbB receptor signalling pathway as a therapeutic target in CMT1A and pharmacological modification of the unfolded protein response in CMT1B. In CMT2D, due to mutations in glycyl-tRNA synthetase, vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated stimulation of the Nrp1 receptor has been identified as a therapeutic target. Preclinical advances have been accompanied by the publication of large natural history cohorts and the identification of a sensitive biomarker of disease (muscle MRI) that is able to detect disease progression in CMT1A over 1 year.SummaryAdvances in next-generation sequencing technology, cell biology and animal models of CMT are paving the way for rational treatments. The combination of robust natural history data and the identification of sensitive biomarkers mean that we are now entering an exciting therapeutic era in the field of the genetic neuropathies.	6.1
Curbing water scarcity problems in semi-arid regions is a top priority for economic and social development. Alternative strategies for sustainable domestic water supply are therefore required to augment water supply with affordable cost and technology. Scant research findings in sub-Saharan Africa have, however, reported inefficiency in adapting to water scarcity problems in the region. Therefore, an investigation of domestic rainwater harvesting (RWH) reliability is important to identify factors affecting the system. We found that rainwater harvesting with the existing traditional RWH systems in Mekelle city was unreliable. Unreliability was attributed to inefficient design (the systems were installed without considering deterministically the stochastic nature of rainfall), family size, water demand, rooftop area and storage tank size.	4.3
Tolerances play an important role in modem manufacturing engineering and impact significantly the quality of a product and machining cost. In conventional methods, tolerances design is divided into two separate sequential stages i.e. product tolerance design and process tolerance design. This sequential tolerances design method would result in some problems in cooperation, continuity, and consistency between two separate design stages. A more rational approach in tolerance design is concurrent tolerancing which consolidate the two sequential design stages into one. In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for concurrent tolerance design based on manufacturing cost and quality loss. A practical example is used to illustrate the design process. The calculation results by using CA are compared with those by conventional nonlinear optimization method.	3.2
Background: Rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life is often reduced during seasonal allergies. The Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (MRQLQ) is a validated tool used to measure quality of life in people experiencing allergies (0 = not troubled to 6 = extremely troubled). Probiotics may improve quality of life during allergy season by increasing the percentage of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inducing tolerance. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether consuming Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, and B. longum MM-2 compared with placebo would result in beneficial effects on MRQLQ scores throughout allergy season in individuals who typically experience seasonal allergies. Secondary outcomes included changes in immune markers as part of a potential mechanism for changes in MRQLQ scores. Design: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial, 173 participants (mean +/- SEM: age 27 +/- 1 y) who self-identified as having seasonal allergies received either a probiotic (2 capsules/d, 1.5 billion colony-forming units/capsule) or placebo during spring allergy season for 8 wk. MRQLQ scores were collected weekly throughout the study. Fasting blood samples were taken from a subgroup (placebo, n = 37; probiotic, n = 35) at baseline and week 6 (predicted peak of pollen) to determine serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E concentrations and Treg percentages. Results: The probiotic group reported an improvement in the MRQLQ global score from baseline to pollen peak (-0.68 +/- 0.13) when compared with the placebo group (-0.19 +/- 0.14; P = 0.0092). Both serum total IgE and the percentage of Tregs increased from baseline to week 6, but changes were not different between groups. Conclusions: This combination probiotic improved rhinoconjunctivitis-specific quality of life during allergy season for healthy individuals with self-reported seasonal allergies; however, the associated mechanism is still unclear. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials. gov as NCT02349711.	5.1
Network attacks and cyber-security breaches may be the cause of huge monetary damages in the modern information-based economy; thus, the need for network security is stronger than ever as it is the need for full traffic sanitization. Nonetheless, the purge of malicious packets is still too often relegated to the destination of the attacks letting the unwanted traffic roam freely. At the same time, the next generation of routers promises to be able to modulate energy consumption on the basis of actual traffic, thus the presence of malicious traffic in the network is a cause of economic losses in itself, even when the attack is not successful. In past work, we modelled and analysed the energy savings enabled by aggressive intrusion detection; however, fluctuations in the traffic intensity has not been fully taken into account. In this article, we introduce a new enhanced adaptive model that takes into full account the actual load of routers including what is due to forecasting errors.	0.2
Bluetooth low energy beacons have gained traction among ambient intelligence researchers. Their low cost and robustness make them a fit choice for ambient assisted living or other healthcare applications. Nevertheless, similar to many other radio-frequency based technologies, beacons pose serious challenges when it comes to developing applications that require predictability. Moreover, the multipath propagation characteristics of Bluetooth beacons prevent ambient intelligent researchers to solely rely on using theoretical models to describe their behaviors. In this paper, we present an empirical evaluation of Bluetooth beacons behaviors. We describe the observed pattern of the signal through a series of experiments totalizing more than 3 million samples.	4.0
One of the most promising fields for ambient intelligence is the implementation of intelligent emergency plans. Because the use of drills and living labs cannot reproduce social behaviors, such as panic attacks, that strongly affect these plans, the use of agent-based social simulation provides an approach to evaluate these plans more thoroughly. (1) The hypothesis presented in this paper is that there has been little interest in describing the key modules that these simulators must include, such as formally represented knowledge and a realistic simulated sensor model, and especially in providing researchers with tools to reuse, extend and interconnect modules from different works. This lack of interest hinders researchers from achieving a holistic framework for evaluating emergency plans and forces them to reconsider and to implement the same components from scratch over and over. In addition to supporting this hypothesis by considering over 150 simulators, this paper: (2) defines the main modules identified and proposes the use of semantic web technologies as a cornerstone for the aforementioned holistic framework; (3) provides a basic methodology to achieve the framework; (4) identifies the main challenges; and (5) presents an open and free software tool to hint at the potential of such a holistic view of emergency plan evaluation in indoor environments.	4.0
The starting point in choosing this theme was the belief that in the specific professional sports instructive activity the dominant form of communication is the nonverbal communication in the coach-athlete relationship, with implications for the improvement of the training process. The study consisted in a sociological approach through an inquiry conducted on a group of athletes. The questionnaire comprised items with prefigured and open answers to facilitate the research in the female gymnasts of the Vasile Alecsandri University of Bacau team. A dominant form of expressing in the sports training is represented by body movements as an expression of energy and information through posture, movement and indices, a psycho-somatic connection (body-soul) through which feelings and emotions are expressed. The gestures of illustration, the artifacts, the facial expressing are other landmarks of the existence of nonverbal communication perceived by the athletes in the sports training process. The body language communication is perceived by most respondents, the messages transmitted this way being continuous, facilitating a dialog between the coach and the female gymnast.

The main goal of this paper is to propose a probability model for computing probabilities of dismissal of 10b-5 securities class-action cases filed in United States Federal district courts. By dismissal, we mean dismissal with prejudice in response to the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, and not eventual dismissal after the discovery process. The proposed probability model is a hybrid of two widely-used methods: logistic regression, and naive Bayes. Using a dataset of 925 10b-5 securities class-action cases filed between 2002 and 2010, we show that the proposed hybrid model has the potential of computing better probabilities than either LR or NB models. By better, we mean lower root mean square errors of probabilities of dismissal. The proposed hybrid model uses the following features: allegations of generally accepted accounting principles violations, allegations of lack of internal control, bankruptcy filing during the class period, allegations of Section 11 violations of Securities Act of 1933, and short-term drop in stock price. Our model is useful for those insurance companies which underwrite Directors and Officers liability policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	2.0
Tau is well established as a microtubule-associated protein in neurons. However, under pathological conditions, aberrant assembly of tau into insoluble aggregates is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neural cell death in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent advances in our understanding of the multiple functions and different locations of tau inside and outside neurons have revealed novel insights into its importance in a diverse range of molecular pathways including cell signalling, synaptic plasticity, and regulation of genomic stability. The present review describes the physiological and pathophysiological properties of tau and how these relate to its distribution and functions in neurons. We highlight the post-translational modifications of tau, which are pivotal in defining and modulating tau localisation and its roles in health and disease. We include discussion of other pathologically relevant changes in tau, including mutation and aggregation, and how these aspects impinge on the propensity of tau to propagate, and potentially drive neuronal loss, in diseased brain. Finally, we describe the cascade of pathological events that may be driven by tau dysfunction, including impaired axonal transport, alterations in synapse and mitochondrial function, activation of the unfolded protein response and defective protein degradation. It is important to fully understand the range of neuronal functions attributed to tau, since this will provide vital information on its involvement in the development and pathogenesis of disease. Such knowledge will enable determination of which critical molecular pathways should be targeted by potential therapeutic agents developed for the treatment of tauopathies.	5.2
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a super family of mixed-function oxidases that are responsible for the human metabolism of drugs and endogenous compounds, as well as environmental and dietary substances. Many CYP enzymes function in the liver, but presence of CYP2E1 in the brain is demonstrating its role in both nicotine and ethanol metabolism. To examine the association between CYP2E1 polymorphism and the risk of oral cancer, we performed a case-control study on a south Indian population. 157 patients with oral cancer and 132 age and sexmatched controls were recruited. Three SNPs of the CYP2E1 gene [4768G>A (p. V179I, dbSNP rs6413419), CYP2E1_-1295G>C (dbSNP rs3813867) and CYP2E1_-1055C>T (dbSNP rs2031920)] were genotyped using TaqMan allelic discrimination. The V179I locus is monomorphic in the study subjects, whereas rs3813867 and rs2031920 are co-inherited with a minor allele frequency of 0.022. None of the polymorphic sites deviated from HWE in controls. A much lesser frequency of the uncommon c2 allele was seen in our control subjects than in Caucasians and East Asians. There were no significant differences between oral cancer and controls in the distribution of either allelic or genotype frequencies. None of the haplotypes showed a significant association with oral cancer. Our results suggest that CYP2E1 is not a major or independent determinant in the pathogenesis of oral cancer in south Indians.	6.2
Focalized short-pulsed lasers have sufficient power to generate micrometersized cavities in various hydrogels. An in situ technique based on laser ablation to fabricate intricate microfluidic networks in biocompatible gels without manual handling is presented. This method is fully compatible with 3D cell culture and opens up unprecedented opportunities for cell biology, developmental biology, and stem-cell-based tissue engineering.	6.1
Once thought to be uniquely human, prosocial behavior has been observed in a number of species, including vampire bats that engage in costly food-sharing. Another social chiropteran, Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), have been observed to engage in cooperative mate guarding, and thus might be expected to display prosocial behavior as well. However, frugivory and hematophagy diets may impose different selection pressures on prosocial preferences, given that prosocial preferences may depend upon cognitive abilities selected by different ecological constraints. Thus, we assessed whether Jamaican fruit bats would assist a conspecific in an escape paradigm in which a donor could opt to release a recipient from an enclosure. The test apparatus contained two compartments-one of which was equipped with a sensor that, once triggered, released the trap door of the adjacent compartment. Sixty-six exhaustive pairs of 12 bats were tested, with each bat in each role, twice when the recipient was present and twice when absent. Bats decreased their behavior of releasing the trapdoor in both conditions over time, decreasing the behavior slightly more rapidly in the recipient absent condition. Bats did not release the door more often when recipients were present, regardless of the recipient; thus, there was no clear evidence of prosocial behavior.	2.4
Research problem: The purpose of the study was to explore the effects of national culture and medium type on first impression bias reduction in the context of job interview and performance appraisals. Research questions: (1) Does the evaluators' national culture affect first impression bias reduction? (2) Which medium type (text or multimedia) is more effective in reducing first impression bias? and (3) Does medium effect in reducing first impression bias vary with national culture? Literature review: The purpose of the literature review is to examine the current literature in the areas of national culture, medium type and first impression bias reduction, especially in a communication context. Researchers reviewed the discussions on first impression formation, and national culture theories, and the Media Richness Theory. For media, multimedia type was found to reduce first impression bias more than text medium type. For national culture, the literature review suggested that national culture dimensions (such as collectivism, assertiveness, and uncertainty avoidance) could possibly affect first impression bias reduction. Methodology: The researchers conducted a quantitative experiment with 407 students from a US university and a Chinese university, who majored in business-related disciplines. Researchers requested the treatment group participants to access performance bias cue. The participants then performed an initial appraisal of a manager based on Denison's leadership index. The participants then viewed the job interview of the manager, via different media, and performed the appraisal again. The performance appraisal data were collected via a website. The researchers used Analysis of Variance to analyze the data. Results and discussion: This study found that for our participants, national culture reduces first impression bias more than media. It identified that first impression bias reduction in US participants is significantly greater than that in Chinese participants, independent of media used. Regardless of national culture of media users, this study found that users using text medium were able to reduce first impression bias significantly more than users using multimedia. The implications of this study are that to reduce first impression bias in cross-cultural settings, managers and employees must adapt the channels and effort allocation for communication to national culture. Managers and researchers must understand that national culture is more important than media in reducing first impression bias. The limitations of the study were the use of student participants, and absence of national culture dimensions measurement. The study was conducted in only two national cultures. Future research could use employees as participants, measure national culture dimensions, and replicate the study in various national cultures.	2.3
Leaving a composite liner exposed for an extended period can sometimes lead to down-slope bentonite erosion from geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). This laboratory study examines a number of factors that can affect the erosion of bentonite particles with an imposed flow of water for one particular geotextile-encased, needle-punched GCL. The factors examined include the effect of an initial wet/dry cycle, water chemistry, flow rate, slope, prior cation exchange, and the effect of no-drying phase in the test cycle. No erosion was observed unless the GCL had been hydrated and dried to create a wet/dry cycle. The most critical factor was found to be the water chemistry. No erosion was observed with tap water (39 ppm calcium) with up to 360 cycles and a flow of 3 L/hour. Tests simulating the evaporation and condensation of water below an exposed composite liner by imposing deionized water on the GCL surface developed erosion holes within 5-6 cycles.

A review of recent studies of early childhood altruism is followed by a report of a study of development of altruism in early childhood at ages 3, 4 and 5 years in terms of children's ability and willingness to help, share, and donate. 178 preschool children were videotaped while interacting in pairs matched by age and sex in an age-appropriate, structured altruism task in which opportunities to help and share arose in the natural flow of events. Results indicate that even the youngest children (age 3) displayed some altruistic acts; both the number of children showing altruism, and their number of altruistic acts, were greater at each succeeding age level. Sharing was the most common altruistic behavior, and it was more frequent than helping and donation behaviors at earlier ages. Possible explanations for the different developmental trajectories of different altruistic acts are discussed, with emphasis on the differing cognitive and empathic demands of the situation. Main contributions of the study include demonstration of (1) different developmental trajectories for different types of altruistic acts; (2) age-related increase in spontaneous altruistic acts toward peers between 3 and 5 years of age; (2) the utility of a naturalistic, structured observational task to study spontaneous altruism towards peers in young children.	2.4
Objective This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Functional Independence Measure to assess preoperative frailty for elderly patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement. Methods Eighty-five patients >65 years who survived elective isolated aortic valve replacement from January 2008 to October 2015 were included. The mean age at the operation was 78 +/- 6 years old (n = 28 males, n = 57 females). The patients were divided into two groups according to their status at discharge: impossible to discharge home or hospitalization for >30 days (compromised group, n = 8), or unaffected (unaffected group, n = 77). Preoperative frailty was evaluated with the Functional Independence Measure, which comprises 18 items divided into six domains: self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. Results The preoperative total Functional Independence Measure score was significantly lower in the compromised group (79 +/- 32) than in the unaffected group (120 +/- 9, p < 0.01). The preoperative motor Functional Independence Measure score was significantly lower in the compromised group (45 +/- 24) than in the unaffected group (85 +/- 9, p = < 0.01). The duration of postoperative intubation, intensive care unit stay, and postoperative hospitalization were significantly longer in the compromised group than in the unaffected group (48 +/- 67 vs 16 +/- 12 h, p < 0.01; 6.7 +/- 5.3 vs 3.4 +/- 2.0 days, p < 0.01; 34 +/- 27 vs 23 +/- 11 days, p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions The preoperative Functional Independence Measure is effective for assessing preoperative frailty in elderly patients undergoing aortic valve replacement in terms of predicting operative morbidity.	2.1
Large eddy simulation (LES) with the approximate deconvolution model is combined with Lagrangian particles simulation (LPS) for simulating turbulent reactive flows at high Schmidt numbers Sc. The LES is used to simulate velocity and nonreactive scalar while reactive scalars are simulated by the LPS using the mixing volume model for molecular diffusion. The LES-LPS is applied to turbulent scalar mixing layers with a second-order isothermal irreversible reaction at Sc5600. The mixing volume model is implemented with the IEM, Curl's, and modified Curl's mixing schemes. The mixing volume model provides a correct decay rate of nonreactive scalar variance at high Sc independently of the number of particles. The statistics in the LES-LPS with the IEM or modified Curl's mixing scheme agree well with the experiments for both moderately-fast and rapid reactions. However, the LPS with the Curl's mixing scheme overpredicts the effects of the rapid reaction. (C) 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers	3.4
Background: Over 100 million Americans are living with chronic pain, and pain is the most common reason that patients seek medical attention. Despite the prevalence of pain, the practice of pain management and the scientific discipline of pain research are relatively new fields compared to the rest of medicine contributing to a twenty-first century dilemma for health care providers asked to relieve suffering in the Fifth Vital Sign era. Methods: This manuscript provides a narrative review of the basic mechanisms of chronic pain and history of chronic pain management in the United States including the various regulatory, health system and provider factors that contributed to the decline of multidisciplinary pain treatment in favor of the predominant opioid treatment strategy seen today. Multiple non-opioid pain treatment strategies are then outlined. The manuscript concludes with three key questions to help guide future research at the intersection of pain and addiction. Conclusions: The assessment and treatment of chronic pain will continue to be one of the most common functions of a health care provider. To move beyond an over reliance on opioid medications, the addiction and pain research communities must unite with chronic pain patients to increase the evidence base supporting non-opioid analgesic strategies.

Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal (OFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) cortices has been linked with several psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and addiction. These conditions are also associated with abnormalities in the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the white matter (WM) bundle carrying ascending and descending fibers from the OFC and ACC. Furthermore, deep-brain stimulation (DBS) for psychiatric disorders targets these fibers. Experiments in rats provide essential information on the mechanisms of normal and abnormal brain anatomy, including WM composition and perturbations. However, whereas descending prefrontal cortex (PFC) fibers in primates form a well defined and topographic anterior limb of the internal capsule, the specific locations and organization of these fibers in rats is unknown. We address this gap by analyzing descending fibers from injections of an anterograde tracer in the rat ACC and OFC. Our results show that the descending PFC fibers in the rat form WM fascicles embedded within the striatum. These bundles are arranged topographically and contain projections, not only to the striatum, but also to the thalamus and brainstem. They can therefore be viewed as the rat homolog of the primate anterior limb of the internal capsule. Furthermore, mapping these projections allows us to identify the fibers likely to be affected by experimental manipulations of the striatum and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. These results are therefore essential for translating abnormalities of human WM and effects of DBS to rodent models.	5.0
Three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D CAD) models with different levels of detail (LOD) are used in various industries for numerous purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques to simplify 3D CAD models in order to adjust the LOD of the model according to its purpose. The main purpose of simplification is to minimize the change in the outer shape of the models and to reduce the data size of the models. The key technologies to achieve these purposes are evaluation metrics and simplification operation. Evaluation metrics are employed to select elements to be preserved or removed by calculating the importance of the geometric elements comprising a 3D CAD model. The simplification operation removes the selected elements and fills up the void in the model caused by the removal. Feature volume and type have been the most popular criteria used in evaluation metrics for the simplification of feature-based 3D CAD models. In this study, the concept of feature shape complexity (FSC) is introduced, and a method of adopting FSC as a criterion of evaluation metrics is presented. A prototype system for the simplification of 3D CAD models is then implemented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by conducting simplification experiments with a complex 3D CAD assembly model.	3.0
Vehicular network has been recently used to achieve high efficient and flexible traffic scheduling at intersection roads for smart transportation systems. Different from existing works, where traffic signal is used to schedule waiting vehicles at each lane, we propose to divide vehicles in the same lane into small groups and schedule vehicle groups via wireless communication rather than traffic lights. Such direct scheduling of vehicles can reduce waiting time and improve fairness, especially when the traffic volume in different lanes is imbalanced. The key challenge in such a design lies in determining appropriate size of groups with respect to real-time traffic conditions. To cope with this issue, we propose a neuro-fuzzy network-based grouping mechanism, where the network is trained using reinforcement learning technique. Also, vehicle groups are scheduled via a neuro-fuzzy network. Simulations using ns3 are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with similar works. The results show that our algorithm can reduce waiting time and at the same time improve fairness in various cases, and the advantage against traffic light algorithms can be up to 40%.	0.1
In this paper, a current sensorless adaptive secondary-side control is proposed for the series resonant converter (SRC), making it a good candidate for MHz 48 voltage regulators. By means of varying ac equivalent resistance, the output voltage regulation is achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the synchronous MOSFET. By taking advantage of the secondary-side control, SRCs can operate under zero-voltage switching at any input voltage and load conditions. A current sensorless adaptive digital control is proposed to control the current-type synchronous MOSFETs, which automatically compensates the delay caused by the current-sensor circuit and the gate driver, and also eliminates the current sensor in the power path. A hybrid control strategy is introduced to overcome the efficiency degradation caused by the secondary-side control.	1.4
One of teenagers' key developmental tasks is to engage in new and meaningful relationships with peers and adults outside the family context. Attachment-derived expectations about the self and others in terms of internal attachment working models have the potential to shape such social reorientation processes critically and thereby influence adolescents' social-emotional development and social integration. Because the neural underpinnings of this developmental task remain largely unknown, we sought to investigate them by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We asked n = 44 adolescents (ages 12.01-18.84 years) to evaluate positive and negative adjectives regarding either themselves or a close other during an adapted version of the well-established self-other trait-evaluation task. As measures of attachment, we obtained scores reflecting participants' positive versus negative attachment-derived self- and other-models by means of the Relationship Questionnaire. We controlled for possible confounding factors by also obtaining scores reflecting internalizing/externalizing problems, schizotypy, and borderline symptomatology. Our results revealed that participants with a more negative attachment-derived self-model showed increased brain activity during positive and negative adjective evaluation regarding the self, but decreased brain activity during negative adjective evaluation regarding a close other, in bilateral amygdala/parahippocampus, bilateral anterior temporal pole/anterior superior temporal gyrus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that a low positivity of the self-concept characteristic for the attachment anxiety dimension may influence neural information processing, but in opposite directions when it comes to self- versus (close) other-representations. We discuss our results in the framework of attachment theory and regarding their implications especially for adolescent social-emotional development and social integration.	2.1
Embodiment has become the central topic of ritual studies. Over recent decades a great deal has changed in the comprehension of ritual, its nature and the main characteristics. This knowledge can become of benefit for liturgy research. Interpreting of ritual is based on an understanding of physical acts, gestures and attitudes. We also find both dimensions expressed in liturgy by the term attitudes physical and mental, as well as the occurrences of a deep embodiment of attitudes in liturgy. Most signification in liturgy takes place in something other than a verbal way. Nonverbal communication is not often dealt with, however, reflected in the liturgy science. The text aims at an analysis of certain approaches, which help in an understanding of the nature of a liturgical act, which is always essentially a ritual act.	2.3
The 2-D analytical solution of electrostatic potential and enhanced drain current is modeled for a dual metal surround gate junctionless transistor (DMSGJLT) by solving the Poisson equation using the parabolic approximation technique. The gate engineered DMSGJLT produces an increase in the mobility of electrons in the channel. Enhancement in drain current of 35 mu A is obtained than single metal JLT for the same dimension. Due to that, the gain increases, short channel effects and leakage current decreases. The electrostatic potential, threshold voltage, drain current, transconductance, drain-induced barrier lowering, power and delay predicted by the analytical solution have excellent agreement with the simulation results obtained from Technology Computer-Aided Design. The analytical modeling provides useful insight on physics of short channel effects. The inverter circuit is implemented with a DMSGJLT and is compared with that of a single metal device. The noise margin analysis is made for the inverter circuit employing both dual metal and single metal devices. It is found that gate engineering improves the noise margin to a much extend and due to this, the voltage loss is also improved with a DMSGJLT.	3.0
For more than a century researchers have used enculturated animals-those extensively trained or reared by humans-to explore the effects of learning and environment on the capacities for linguistic abilities outside of the human line. Unfortunately, due to many controversies, the findings of these studies frequently have been dismissed or outright ignored. However, experimental exploration of the capacities of nonhumans is the only option to determine which, if any, language-associated capacities are unique to humans. Researchers continue to publish findings from language projects that move our understanding forward, including descriptions of capacities, such as gestural comprehension, declarative communication, and categorization, that are frequently considered to be specific biological adaptations.	2.1
The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011 fatally damaged the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), caused prolonged station blackout (SBO). Following the SBO, the reactor water level gradually dropped due to the increase in steam discharge from safety relief valves and eventually led to nuclear fuel melt down. Almost four years have passed since the accident, and official reports by the Japanese regulatory have given the general description of causes and progressions of the fatal accident. Even after the Fukushima accident, more than 430 nuclear power plants are currently operating and over 80 units are under construction worldwide. From this fact alone, it is extremely important to learn from the Fukushima accident and enhance the safety culture of the reactor operation to completely eliminate the possibilities of catastrophic accidents seen in 2011. In this study, the best estimate transient thermal-hydraulics code, RETRAN-03/MODO4 was utilized to focus on the effectiveness of the Isolation Condenser (IC) installed on Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWR). The ICs turned out to be one of the very few operable safety systems during the Fukushima accident, and this simple yet reliable safety system should be utilized to secure ABWR from possible reactor core damages. In the present paper, several case studies conducted utilizing the ICs are presented and methods of countermeasures to improve light water reactor safety level in design and operation features are proposed.

Siblings of people with disabilities have more exposure to people with disabilities than most nondisabled people, uniquely positioning them toward disability, yet less is known about how this might impact their attitudes. This study examined siblings' disability attitudes by determining siblings' explicit and implicit disability bias, mapping their 2-dimensional prejudice, and examining theoretical variables that might be relevant to their attitudes. To do so, the Disability Attitudes Implicit Association Test, the Symbolic Ableism Scale, and survey questions were administered to 48 siblings. Findings revealed the majority of the siblings implicitly preferred nondisabled people, despite reporting low levels of explicit attitudes.	2.0
Intergroup contact-(positive) interactions with people from different social groups-is a widely researched and strongly supported prejudice-reducing mechanism shown to reduce prejudice against a wide variety of outgroups. However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.	2.0
Despite the widespread inclusion of diversity-related curricula in U.S. medical training, racial disparities in the quality of care and physician bias in medical treatment persist. The present study examined the effects of both formal and informal experiences on non-African American medical students' (N = 2,922) attitudes toward African Americans in a longitudinal study of 49 randomly selected U.S. medical schools. We assessed the effects of experiences related to medical training, accounting for prior experiences and attitudes. Contact with African Americans predicted positive attitudes toward African Americans relative to white people, even beyond the effects of prior attitudes. Furthermore, students who reported having witnessed instructors make negative racial comments or jokes were significantly more willing to express racial bias themselves, even after accounting for the effects of contact. Examining the effects of informal experiences on racial attitudes may help develop a more effective medical training environment and reduce racial disparities in healthcare.	2.0
In order to gain mechanistic insights into multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, we utilized a multi-dimensional approach to test the hypothesis that mutations in myelin proteins lead to immune activation and central nervous system autoimmunity in MS. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human MS brain lesions revealed seven unique mutations of PLP1; a key myelin protein that is known to be destroyed in MS. Surprisingly, in-depth genomic analysis of two MS patients at the genomic DNA and mRNA confirmed mutated PLP1 in RNA, but not in the genomic DNA. Quantification of wild type and mutant PLP RNA levels by qPCR further validated the presence of mutant PLP RNA in the MS patients. To seek evidence linking mutations in abundant myelin proteins and immune-mediated destruction of myelin, specific immune response against mutant PLP1 in MS patients was examined. Thus, we have designed paired, wild type and mutant peptide microarrays, and examined antibody response to multiple mutated PLP1 in sera from MS patients. Consistent with the idea of different patients exhibiting unique mutation profiles, we found that 13 out of 20 MS patients showed antibody responses against specific but not against all the mutant-PLP1 peptides. Interestingly, we found mutant PLP-directed antibody response against specific mutant peptides in the sera of pre-MS controls. The results from integrative proteomic, genomic, and immune analyses reveal a possible mechanism of mutation-driven pathogenesis in human MS. The study also highlights the need for integrative genomic and proteomic analyses for uncovering pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases.	6.3
Industrial manufacturers are required to adopt water conservation and pollution control technologies because of increasingly serious water scarcity and water pollution, especially in textile industry. An effective performance evaluation tool for these technologies is greatly needed for textile manufacturers. However, the existing tools for textile industry can only evaluate on plant level and ignore pollution effect of water consumption. In order to help textile manufacturers know about water conservation and pollution control performance of technologies more systematically and comprehensively, we developed a process-level water conservation and pollution control performance evaluation tool of cleaner production technology in textile industry. The new tool includes three indicators: water withdrawal reduction, water consumption reduction and water assimilation reduction. Comparison between the new tool and old ones by evaluating the low-pollution-concentration effluent reuse technology in a polyester flannel fabric dyeing and printing plant demonstrates that the new tool can help textile manufacturers to not only understand operation mechanism of a technology on specific processes and then take specific improvement measures on different processes to optimize water conservation and pollution control performance, but also find out indiscoverable disadvantages of a technology and then adopt complementary technologies to reduce negative effect of the technology.

Water pollution has been a major concern for agrarian societies like Pakistan. Pharmaceutical industries are amongst the foremost contributor to industrial waste. Present study addresses the generation of oxidative stress caused by 2 months exposure to pharmaceutical wastewater in rats and their response to oral treatment with vitamin E, a potent antioxidant. The rats were randomized into five groups (n = 5) named as negative control, pharmaceutical wastewater (PEW) 100 %, PEW 10 %, PEW 1 %, and PEW 100 % + vitamin E. Oxidative damage in rats was evaluated by estimation of the activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), catalase (CAT), and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the liver, kidney, and blood/plasma. Exposure to pharmaceutical wastewater significantly decreased the activities of T-SOD and CAT and concentration of H2O2 in the liver and kidney and blood/plasma. Exposure to 100 % pharmaceutical wastewater exhibited a maximum decline in T-SOD activity, and activity was reduced to only 63.57 U/mL, 32.65, and 43.57 U/mg of protein in the plasma, kidney, and liver, respectively. Exposure to wastewater minimized activity CAT to 89.25 U/g of hemoglobin, 54.36, and 62.95 U/mg of protein in the blood, kidney, and liver, respectively. Treatment with vitamin E significantly increased the activity of T-SOD and CAT. However, increase in concentration of H2O2 was also observed in vitamin E exposed rats. Histopathology of the kidney revealed coagulative necrosis of renal epithelial cells and peritubular congestion. Endocardium showed infiltration of inflammatory cells and cellular breakdown in some areas. Lung sections exhibited atelectasis and emphysema of alveoli suggesting decline in lung function. The anatomy of the liver was also compromised due to severe degeneration and cellular swelling. The present study concluded that pharmaceutical wastewater induced severe oxidative stress in Wistar rats and ensued in histopathological lesions in several vital organs suggesting its high toxicity. Non-enzymatic antioxidant vitamin E may ameliorate oxidative stress induced by pharmaceutical wastewater.	4.4
Maintenance of ballasted railway tracks is a major cost for railway infrastructure owners. In many developed countries, much of the railway infrastructure is mature and was built for service requirements long since superseded. The increased demands on historic infrastructure can lead to the development or exacerbation of localised trackbed problems that require disproportionate levels of maintenance. Identifying these and applying cost effective remediation has the potential to reduce maintenance spend in the long term. However, it is not always clear what the most cost effective remediation will be. One type of localised maintenance issue is the development of wet beds or wet spots, which can occur where saturated clayey subgrade soils are overloaded and result in the development of mud pumping as trains pass. This leads to the migration of fines into the ballast bed and a deterioration in local track performance. Over time the track overlying the wet bed settles disproportionately more, sleepers become progressively more voided, and train ride quality deteriorates. Maintenance of the wet bed may involve locally digging out and replacing the ballast; however, unless the underlying cause is addressed the problem is likely to recur, requiring repeated localised maintenance interventions. This is costly, reactive and ultimately an ineffective approach to managing the problem. This paper presents a study of a wet bed in the UK, both prior to and after a full track renewal. Transient track deflections during train passage were monitored using sleeper mounted geophones and high speed filming techniques. Loaded track geometry data were obtained from a track recording vehicle. It is shown that local maintenance interventions were generally ineffective, but that a renewal of the top 200 mm of the trackbed including placement of a geotextile filter and geogrid appears to have been successful in remediating the problem, at least in the short term.	4.1
The advancement of software defined networking (SDN) is redefining traditional computer networking architecture. The role of the control plane of SDN is of such importance that SDNs are referred to as network operating systems (OSs). However, the robustness and security of the network OS has been overlooked. In this paper, we report three main issues pertaining to network OSs. First, we identified vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious or buggy applications running on network OSs. We also identified four major attack vectors that could undermine network OS operations: denial of service, global data manipulation, control plane poisoning, and system shell execution. Further, it was demonstrated that real-world attacks can be launched on commonly used network OSs without significant effort. Second, we present a method to address the attacks by analyzing network applications running on network OSs to identify their behavioral features, which enabled the extraction of a permission set for each network application. Based on this work, a permission-based malicious network application detector was introduced, which examines the permission set of each application and prevents it from executing without permission. Our system shows almost no performance overhead. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	0.2
Increased obesity rates, an evolving food supply and the overconsumption of energy dense foods has led to an increase in research exploring addictive eating behaviours. This study aimed to investigate food addiction in a sample of Australian adults using the revised Yale Food Addiction Survey (YFAS) 2.0 tool and how it is associated with dietary intake, personality traits and mental health issues. Australian adults were invited to complete an online survey that collected information including: demographics, dietary intake, depression, anxiety, stress and personality dimensions including impulsivity, sensation seeking, hopelessness and anxiety sensitivity. A total of 1344 individuals were recruited with the samples comprising 75.7% female, mean age 39.8 +/- 13.1 years (range 18-91 years) and body mass index BMI 27.7 +/- 9.5. Food addiction was identified in 22.2% of participants using the YFAS 2.0 tool, which classified the severity of food addiction as mild in 0.7% of cases, moderate in 2.6% and severe in 18.9% of cases. Predictors of severe food addiction were female gender (odds ratio (OR) 3.65 95% CI 1.86-7.11) and higher levels of soft drink OR 1.36 (1.07-1.72), confectionary consumption and anxiety sensitivity 1.16 (1.07-1.26). Overall people with severe (OR 13.2, 5.8-29.8) or extremely severe depressive symptoms (OR 15.6, range 7.1-34.3) had the highest odds of having severe food addiction. The only variable that reduced the odds of having severe food addiction was vegetable intake. The current study highlights that addictive food behaviours are associated with a complex pattern of poor dietary choices and a clustering with mental health issues, particularly depression.	5.0
Plastic wastes, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET) generated from used bottled water constitute a worldwide environmental issue. Reusing the PET waste for geotechnical applications not only reduces environmental burdens of handling the waste, but also improves inherent engineering properties of soil. This paper investigated factors affecting shear strength improvement of PET-mixed residual soil. Four variables were considered: (i) plastic content; (ii) plastic slenderness ratio; (iii) plastic size; and (iv) soil particle size. A series of unconfined compression tests were performed to determine the optimum configurations for promoting the shear strength improvement. The results showed that the optimum slenderness ratio and PET content for shear strength improvement were 1:3 and 1.5%, respectively. Large PET pieces (i.e., 1.0 cm(2)) were favorable for fine-grained residual soil, while small PET pieces (i.e., 0.5 cm2) were favorable for coarse-grained residual soil. Higher shear strength improvement was obtained for PET-mixed coarse-grained residual soil (148%) than fine-grained residual soils (117%). The orientation of plastic pieces in soil and frictional resistance developed between soil particles and PET surface are two important factors affecting the shear strength performance of PET-mixed soil.	4.1
Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cancer has proceeded to surpass one of the most chronic illnesses to be the major cause of mortality in both the developing and developed world. Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen, family Guttiferae) known as the queen of fruits, is one of the most popular tropical fruits. It is cultivated in Southeast Asian countries: Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, and Philippines. Traditionally, numerous parts of G. mangostana have been utilized to treat various ailments such as abdominal pain, haemorrhoids, food allergies, arthritis, leucorrhoea, gonorrhea, diarrhea, dysentery, wound infection, suppuration, and chronic ulcer. Aim of study: Although anticancer activity has been reported for the plant, the goal of the study was designed to isolate and characterize the active metabolites from G. mangostana and measure their cytotoxic properties. In this research, the mechanism of antiproliferative/cytotoxic effects of the tested compounds was investigated. Materials and methods: The CHCl3 fraction of the air-dried fruit hulls was repeatedly chromatographed on SiO2, RP18, Diaion HP-20, and polyamide columns to furnish fourteen compounds. The structures of these metabolites were proven by UV, IR, 1D, and 2D NMR measurements and HRESIMS. Additionally, the cytotoxic potential of all compounds was assessed against MCF-7, HCT-116, and HepG2 cell lines using SRB-U assay. Antiproliferative and cell cycle interference effects of potentially potent compounds were tested using DNA content flow cytometry. The mechanism of cell death induction was also studied using annexin-V/PI differential staining coupled with flow cytometry. Results: The CHCl3 soluble fraction afforded two new xanthones: mangostanaxanthones V (1) and VI (2), along with twelve known compounds: mangostanaxanthone N (3), beta-mangostin (4), garcinone E (5), alpha-mangostin (6), nor-mangostin (7), garcimangosone D (8), aromadendrin-8-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside (9), 1,2,4,5-tetrahydroxybenzene (10), 2,4,3'-trihydroxybenzophenone-6-O-beta-glucopyranoside (11), maclurin-6-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (rhodanthenone) (12), epicatechin (13), and 2,4,6,3',5'-pentahydroxybenzophenone (14). Only compound 5 showed considerable antiproliferative/cytotoxic effects with IC50's ranging from 15.8 to 16.7 mu M. Compounds 3, 4, and 6 showed moderate to weak cytotoxic effects (IC50's ranged from 45.7 to 116.4 mu M). Using DNA content flow cytometry, it was found that only 5 induced significant cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1)-phase which is indicative of its antiproliferative properties. Additionally, by using annexin V-FITC/PI differential staining, 5 induced cells killing effect via the induction of apoptosis and necrosis in both HepG(2) and HCT116 cells. Compound 3 produce necrosis and apoptosis only in HCT116 cells. On contrary, 6 induced apoptosis and necrosis in HepG(2) cells and moderate necrosis in HCT116 cells. Conclusion: Fourteen compounds were isolated from chloroform fraction of G. mangostana fruit hulls. Cytotoxic properties exhibited by the isolated xanthones from G. mangostana reinforce the avail of it as a natural cytotoxic agent against various cancers. These evidences could provide relevant bases for the scientific rationale of using G. mangostana in anti-cancer treatment.	5.1
This paper presents a fully-integrated wireless bondwire accelerometer using a closed-loop readout interface that effectively reduces the noise from electrical circuits and long-term frequency drifts. The proposed accelerometer was fabricated using 0.18-mu m CMOS technology without micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) processing. To reduce manufacturing errors, the bondwire inertial sensors are wire-bonded on the chip pads, thereby enabling a precisely-defined length and space between sensing bondwires. The proposed wireless accelerometer using a pair of 15.2 mu m and 25.4 mu m bondwires achieves a linear transducer gain of 33 mV/g, bandwidth of 5 kHz, a noise floor of 700 mu g/root Hz, and 4.5 mu g bias stability. The acceleration data is digitalized by an energy-efficient 10-bit SAR ADC and then wirelessly transmitted in real time to the external reader by a low-power on-off shift keying (OOK) transmitter. The proposed architecture consumes 9 mW and the chip area is 2 mm x 2.4 mm.	1.2
Neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic pain condition occurring after damage in the nervous system and is refractory to the currently available treatments. Major challenges include elucidating its mechanisms and developing new medications to treat it. Nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity involves aberrant excitability in spinal dorsal horn (SDH) neurons as a consequence of dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons and of hyperactivity of glial cells, especially microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system. Evidence of this is found using animal models to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuropathic pain. The pathologically altered somatosensory signals in the SDH then convey to the brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In these regions, nerve injury produces pre- and postsynaptic long-term plasticity, which contributes to negative emotions and anxiety associated with chronic pain conditions. Furthermore, recent evidence also indicates that the descending projection pathways from the ACC directly and indirectly to the SDH (the top-down corticospinal network) regulate nociceptive sensory transmission in the SDH. Thus, understanding a possible connection between the SDH and ACC, including a neuron-microglia interaction, may provide us with insights into the mechanisms used to amplify pain signals related to neuropathic pain and clues to aid the development of new therapeutic agents for the management of chronic pain.	5.4
The time-varying flow is studied experimentally in an anatomically accurate model of the human airways from the mouth through several generations of bronchial branching. The airway geometry is obtained from the CT scan of a healthy adult male of normal height and build. The three-component, three-dimensional mean velocity field is obtained throughout the entire model using phase-locked Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry. A pulsatile pump drives a sinusoidal waveform (inhalation and exhalation) with frequency and stroke-length such that the mean trachea Reynolds number at peak inspiration is 4200 and the Womersley number is 7. Integral parameters are defined to quantify the degree of velocity profile non-uniformity (related to axial dispersion) and secondary flow strength (lateral dispersion). It is found that the extrathoracic airways significantly modify the tracheal flow and that the flow at the first bifurcation is highly asymmetric. The effect of flow oscillation is to produce time dependent flow features which are asymmetric with respect to the acceleration and deceleration periods surrounding peak inhalation and exhalation. This is most pronounced in regions of separation and on the secondary flow structure, which are sensitive to local attributes of the real anatomy. This is reflected in the integral parameters, which behave non-monotonically between successive bronchial generations. In general, the measured oscillatory flow in a realistic anatomy confirms many trends derived from idealized models but also possesses qualitatively different large scale flow structures as compared to idealized representations of the upper airways.

Data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut are considered key parameters in the control and matching of production in each layer of intelligent well wellbores. Owing to the complicated conditions in the downhole, no permanent downhole flowmeter is installed in the current simple intelligent well system of onshore oilfields in China. Furthermore, necessary real-time data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer cannot be obtained. On the basis of mass conservation equation, momentum conservation equation, and theories of heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics in porous medium, this study establishes the energy conservation equation of fluids in the tubing and annulus. By using the single-point real-time data of the pressure and temperature in the tubing and annulus, the temperature gradient in each producing layer can be deduced. Moreover, the temperature profile, data on reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer can be calculated. This approach is used to solve the problem of flow measurement in each producing layer of intelligent well systems without permanent downhole flowmeters in onshore Chinese oilfields. According to the production data of intelligent well Lei 632, the temperature distribution along the wellbore is analyzed, the water yield formation is diagnosed, and the reservoir parameters, production rate, and water cut in each producing layer are calculated. The analytic solution of the method agrees well with that of the conventional production logging, thus indicating the feasibility of the method in realizing the dynamic monitoring of intelligent wells and in solving the actual problem in real time. The proposed method fills in the gaps in theories on intelligent well technology in China. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.4
Sudden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS) is a perplexing disorder to both forensic pathologists and clinic physicians. Clinical features of SUNDS survivors suggested that SUNDS is similar to Brugada syndrome (BrS). Leucine-rich repeat containing 10 (LRRC10) gene was a newly identified gene linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, a disease associated with sudden cardiac death. To investigate the prevalence and spectrum of genetic variants of LRRC10 gene in SUNDS and BrS, the coding regions of LRRC10 were genetically screened in 113 sporadic SUNDS victims (from January 2005 to December 2015, 30.7 +/- 7.5 years) and ten BrS patients (during January 2010 to December 2014, 38.7 +/- 10.3 years) using direct Sanger sequencing. Afterwards, LRRC10 missense variant carriers were screened for a panel of 80 genes known to be associated with inherited cardiac arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy using target-captured next-generation sequencing. In this study, an in silico-predicted malignant LRRC10 mutation p.E129K was detected in one SUNDS victim without pathogenic rare variant in a panel of 80 arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy-related genes. We also provided evidence to show that rare variant p.P69L might contribute to the genetic cause for one SUNDS victim and two BrS family members. This is the first report of genetic screening of LRRC10 in Chinese SUNDS victims and BrS patients. LRRC10 may be a new susceptible gene for SUNDS, and LRRC10 variant was initially and genetically linked to BrS-associated arrhythmia.	6.4
Traditional imaging spectropolarimetry generally requires slit, moving parts, electrically tunable devices, or the use of micropolarized arrays. Furthermore, the acquired raw data are a physical superposition of interferogram and image. Given their complicated structure, poor seismic capacity, low detection sensitivity, and heavy computations with approximation in spectral reconstruction, meeting the needs for applications in aviation, remote sensing, and field detection is difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, a new spectropolarimetric imaging technique based on static dual intensity-modulated Fourier transform is presented. The system consists of a front telescopic system, two phase retarders, a linear polarizer, a Wollaston prism, a Savart polariscope, a linear analyzer, a reimaging system, and a charge-coupled device (CCD) array detector. The incident light is modulated through a module of polarization spectrum modulation, which consists of the retarders and the polarizer. The Wollaston prism splits the modulated incident light into two equal intensities, orthogonally polarized components with a small divergent angle. After passing through the interference module, which is composed of the Savart polariscope and the analyzer, then the reimaging system, two full-polarization interferograms, which are the superposition of background images and interference fringes, are recorded simultaneously on a single CCD. The pure target image and the pure interference fringes can be simply achieved from the summation or the difference of the two interferograms. Spectral and complete polarization information can be acquired by using the Fourier transform of the pure interference fringes. The principle and the configuration of the system are described here in this paper. The reconstruction processes of the target image and the full Stokes polarization spectra are theoretically analyzed and mathematically simulated. The results show that the system can availably separate background image from interference fringes of the target, achieving high-precision spectral reconstruction and effective extraction of the complete polarization information. Compared with the features of existing instruments, one of the salient features of the described model is to use the dual-intensity modulation, which can avoid mutual interference between the image and the fringes from the hardware and is conducive to the extraction of pure interference fringes with high signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). With this feature, the inadequacies on traditional spectral reconstruction, such as large computation, heavy data processing, and low accuracy of acquired information, are overcome. Moreover, the entrance slit in the front telescopic system is removed, which greatly increases the transmittance and flux of the incident light and improves the SNR of the interferogram. The modified Savart polariscope is used in the interference module. Its transverse shearsplitting principle further enlarges the field of view and increases the spectral resolution of the straight fringes. Thus, this design has the advantages of good stability, high spectrum, high sensitivity, large SNR, high-precision information reconstruction, and low-complexity data processing, as well as simultaneous detection of image, spectrum, and complete polarization information. This work will provide an important theoretical basis and practical instruction for developing new spectropolarimetric imaging technique and its engineering applications.	4.2
Morality, sociability, and competence are distinct dimensions in person perception. We argue that a person's morality informs us about their likely intentions, whereas their competence and sociability inform us about the likelihood that they will fulfill those intentions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that whereas morality would be considered unconditionally positive, sociability and competence would be highly positive only in moral others, and would be less positive in immoral others. Using exploratory factor analyses, Studies 1a and 1b distinguished evaluations of morality and sociability. Studies 2 to 5 then showed that sociability and competence are evaluated positively contingent on moralityStudy 2 demonstrated this phenomenon, while the remaining studies explained it (Study 3), generalized it (Studies 3-5), and ruled out an alternative explanation for it (Study 5). Study 6 showed that the positivity of morality traits is independent of other morality traits. These results support a functionalist account of these dimensions of person perception.	2.2
ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the theory of mind ability in a sample of obese patients with and without binge eating disorder (BED) and to explore the correlations between emotional and clinical assessments. MethodsOverall, 20 non-BED, 16 under-threshold BED and 22 BED obese patients completed a battery of tests assessing social cognition and eating disorder psychopathology. ResultsBinge eating disorder, non-BED and under-threshold-BED obese patients showed similar ability to recognise others' emotions, but BED obese patients exhibited a deficit in recognising their own emotions as demonstrated by more impaired levels of alexithymia and interoceptive awareness and were more depressed. High positive correlations were evident between binging, depression, interoceptive awareness and alexithymia. ConclusionsBinge eating disorder patients have a comparable ability to understand others' emotions but a more impaired capacity to understand and code their own emotions compared with non-BED obese patients. This impairment is highly correlated with depression. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.	2.1
This study presents the first attempt to link the multi-algorithm genetically adaptive search method (AMALGAM) with a groundwater model to define pumping rates within a well distributed set of Pareto solutions. The pumping rates along with three minimization objectives, i.e. minimizing shortage affected by the failure to supply, modified shortage index and minimization of extent of drawdown within prespecified regions, were chosen to define an optimal solution for groundwater drawdown and subsidence. Hydraulic conductivity, specific yield parameters of a modular threedimensional finite-difference (MODFLOW) groundwater model were first optimized using Cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) by minimizing the sum of absolute deviation between the observed and simulated water table depths. These parameters were then applied in AMALGAM to optimize the pumping rate variables for an arid groundwater system in Iran. The Pareto parameter sets yielded satisfactory results when maximum and minimum drawdowns of the aquifer were defined in a range of -40 to +40 cm/year. Overall, 'Modelling - Optimization - Simulation' procedure was capable to compute a set of optimal solutions displayed on a Pareto front. The proposed optimal solution provides sustainable groundwater management alternatives to decision makers in arid region.	3.1
Giant invasive sacral schwannomas are rare tumors. Surgical excision is the standard treatment and total resection is performed if feasible. Advances in three-dimensional (3D) imaging technology have facilitated treatment designs of complex surgical procedures. Our aim was to evaluate virtual surgical planning, computer-aided design (CAD), and manufacturing with 3D printing technology of the customized osteotomy guiding device in giant invasive sacral schwannoma resection. A digital 3D model of the sacrum, including the giant invasive sacral schwannoma, was rendered from patient computer tomography (CT) images. The surgeon chose excision margins of the tumor. Based on the virtual surgical planning, the customized guiding tool for osteotomy was designed and manufactured using the CAD and 3D printing. We used the guiding block to successfully excise a giant sacral schwannoma using only a posterior approach to achieve gross total resection. No augmented spinal instrumentation was used to prevent iatrogenic spinal instability. Clinical symptoms resolved dramatically after operation. No spinal instability occurred during follow-up. With the assistance of an image-based customized osteotomy guiding device, we achieved both goals of tumor resection and bone preservation in giant sacral schwannoma resection. With thorough surgical planning, this technology can be applied to the complex surgical procedures easily and reliably.	3.0
An analytic model is presented for quantitatively investigating the impact of friction between the punch and the shot sleeve on dynamic match status during the injection process of squeeze casting, with the ultimate purpose of optimizing machine design and controlling injection process more accurately. By combining lubrication model and friction experiment, the friction characteristics between the punch and the shot sleeve are investigated in four cases of different clearance values. The lubrication model is validated by comparing the calculated and experimental values of the friction coefficient. The friction model of injection process is then established by means of updating incremental boundary conditions iteratively. The temperature and deformation data are collected from laboratory testing and used to compare with the simulation data obtained from both the general model and the proposed friction model. The simulation data from the friction model is approximately in agreement with the experimental data, better than the general model, implying that the proposed analytics model provides more accurate simulation of the friction coefficients.

It has been suggested that dogs' ability to comprehend human pointing gestures evolved as a by-product of the socio-emotional changes associated with domestication. Given the large role played by the oxytocin system in socio-emotional processes, it is possible to hypothesize a role for oxytocin in modulating dogs' socio-communicative skills. Indeed, it has been shown that intranasal oxytocin enhances dogs' ability to use human pointing cues in an object choice task, a classic paradigm used to assess the ability to follow a pointing gesture. We further tested this hypothesis in another sample of dogs and replicated the above findings. We also provided a novel explanation to the above findings, suggesting that oxytocin released during human-dog interactions increases the positive expectations about human behaviour via emotion and reward processes and thus facilitates the interpretation of pointing as leading to positive events. Given the large and deep homology across mammals in the neural mechanisms involved in emotions, oxytocin could be involved in the acquisition of socio-communicative skills during human typical as well as pathological development.	2.1
This study presents the development of a new fault zone identification scheme for busbar using logistic regression binary classifier by utilising one cycle post-fault current signals of all the bays connected to the busbar. Practicability of the presented scheme has been verified by modelling an existing 400 kV Indian power generating station in power systems computer-aided design/electro-magnetic transient design and control software package. The presented scheme has been tested on enormous cases (38,400) which were generated by varying system and fault parameters. The proposed scheme provides effective discrimination between internal and external faults with a very high (99.69%) overall accuracy. Moreover, it remains stable in case of heavy through fault conditions particularly with current transformer saturation during which the conventional differential protection scheme mal-operates. Furthermore, it provides equally compatible accuracy for unknown system/unseen data set as well as for double/one-and-half breaker busbar arrangement. In addition, performance of the proposed scheme has been verified on the laboratory prototype and results are found to be satisfactory. The average tripping time is of the order of 23 ms in case of internal faults. At last, comparative evaluation of the proposed scheme with recently presented schemes in the literature indicates its superiority.	3.0
Describing user activity plays an essential role in ambient intelligence. In this work, we review different methods for human activity recognition, classified as data-driven and knowledge-based techniques. We focus on context ontologies whose ultimate goal is the tracking of human behavior. After studying upper and domain ontologies, both useful for human activity representation and inference, we establish an evaluation criterion to assess the suitability of the different candidate ontologies for this purpose. As a result, any missing features, which are relevant for modeling daily human behaviors, are identified as future challenges.	4.0
Background: Brain networks in fMRI are typically identified using spatial independent component analysis (ICA), yet other mathematical constraints provide alternate biologically-plausible frameworks for generating brain networks. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) would suppress negative BOLD signal by enforcing positivity. Spatial sparse coding algorithms (L1 Regularized Learning and K-SVD) would impose local specialization and a discouragement of multitasking, where the total observed activity in a single voxel originates from a restricted number of possible brain networks. New method: The assumptions of independence, positivity, and sparsity to encode task-related brain networks are compared; the resulting brain networks within scan for different constraints are used as basis functions to encode observed functional activity. These encodings are then decoded using machine learning, by using the time series weights to predict within scan whether a subject is viewing a video, listening to an audio cue, or at rest, in 304 fMRI scans from 51 subjects. Results and comparison with existing method: The sparse coding algorithm of L1 Regularized Learning outperformed 4 variations of ICA (p < 0.001) for predicting the task being performed within each scan using artifact-cleaned components. The NMF algorithms, which suppressed negative BOLD signal, had the poorest accuracy compared to the ICA and sparse coding algorithms. Holding constant the effect of the extraction algorithm, encodings using sparser spatial networks (containing more zero-valued voxels) had higher classification accuracy (p < 0.001). Lower classification accuracy occurred when the extracted spatial maps contained more CSF regions (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The success of sparse coding algorithms suggests that algorithms which enforce sparsity, discourage multitasking, and promote local specialization may capture better the underlying source processes than those which allow inexhaustible local processes such as ICA. Negative BOLD signal may capture task-related activations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
This paper presents a three-phase back-to-back transformerless inverter for online uninterruptible power supply applications. The inverter consists of a three-phase three-wire input rectifier stage and a three-phase four-wire output inverter stage with their ground wires tied together. Both of the two stages are with sinusoidal pulse width modulation based division-summation (D-Sigma) digital control. The input stage controls the power flow between utility grid and dc link, regulates the dc-link voltage, and fulfills power factor correction. While the output stage tracks three-phase ac reference voltages. The proposed control laws derived based on the D-Sigma digital approach take into account the effects of dc-link voltage fluctuation, grid-voltage distortion, and inductance variation due to different current levels. Thus, distortion of input current and output voltage, and filter inductor core size can be reduced significantly. Moreover, circulating current through their common ground can be suppressed effectively. Simulated and experimental results from a three-phase back-to-back transformerless inverter have confirmed the analysis and discussion of the proposed control approach.	1.4
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to increase cognitive performance in some clinical studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is a lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of SSRIs as cognition enhancers in AD, and the role of SSRIs as a treatment for AD remains largely unclear. Here, we characterized the impact of fluoxetine (FLX), a well-known SSRI, on neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and in CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus of middle-aged (16 to 17 months old) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice. We found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of FLX (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks effectively alleviated the impairment of spatial learning ability in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice as evaluated using the Morris water maze. More importantly, the number of neurons in the hippocampal DG was significantly increased by FLX. Additionally, FLX reduced the deposition of beta amyloid, inhibited GSK-3 beta activity and increased the level of beta-catenin in middle-aged APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that FLX delayed the progression of neuronal loss in the hippocampal DG in middle-aged AD mice, and this effect may underlie the FLX-induced improvement in learning ability. FLX may therefore serve as a promising therapeutic drug for AD.	5.2
Novel diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) incorporate biomarkers, but their maturity for implementation in clinical practice at the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment [ MCI]) is unclear. Here, we evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid42 (A beta 42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau in the light of a 5-phase framework for biomarker development. Ample evidence is available for phase 1 (identifying useful leads) and phase 2 (assessing the accuracy for AD dementia versus controls) for CSF biomarkers. Phase 3 (utility in MCI) is partially achieved. In cohorts with long follow-up time, CSF A beta 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau have high diagnostic accuracy for MCI due to AD. Phase 4 (performance in real world) is ongoing, and phase 5 studies (quantify impact and costs) are to come. Our results highlight priorities to pursue and to enable the proper use of CSF biomarkers in the clinic. Priorities are to reduce measurement variability by introduction of fully automated assay systems; to increase diagnostic specificity toward non-AD neurocognitive diseases at the MCI stage; and to clarify the role of CSF biomarkers versus other biomarker modalities in clinical practice and in design of clinical trials. These efforts are currently ongoing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
The use of power converters has considerably grown up, in part, because refined control strategies have been recently proposed, including nonlinear schemes such as predictive control. This approach is used in this work considering a variable grid frequency environment in order to get an appropriate response for a wide ac mains frequency range. Indeed, in order to achieve appropriate, both dynamic and static, responses for all operating frequencies, the number of samples per period is kept constant and independent of the ac mains frequency. This allows a fixed resolution of the sensed voltages and/or currents, which is preferable if high-performance digital control schemes are required. However, imposing a constant number of samples per period requires a variable sampling time in systems that feature variable ac mains frequency. On the other hand, predictive control has been developed and well documented just for a constant sampling frequency. This work presents how to extend the predictive control algorithms for variable sampling time allowing high-performance waveforms and wider ac mains frequency range. Simulated and experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed control strategy which corroborates the mathematical and model analysis.	1.4
Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, namely PD-L1 and PD-L2, are one of the key factors responsible for inhibitory T cell signaling, mediating the mechanisms of tolerance and providing immune homeostasis. Mounting evidence demonstrates that impaired PD-1:PD-L function plays an important role in a variety of autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), encephalomyelitis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), Behcet's disease (BD), myasthenia gravis (MG), autoimmune uveitis (AU), Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), myocarditis, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). By investigating the candidate genes, genome-wide association studies, and identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PD-1 gene in humans, it has been shown that there is a higher risk in relevant genetic associations with developing autoimmune diseases in certain ethnic groups. In this review we have tried to present a comprehensive role of PD-1:PD-L in all recently studied autoimmune diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.3
Document embedding is a technology that captures informative representations from high-dimensional observations by some structure-preserving maps over corpus and has been intensively explored in machine learning. Recently, some manifold-inspired embedding methods become a hot topic, mainly due to their ability in capturing discriminative embedding. However, the existing methods capture the embeddings based on the geometrical information of nearest neighbors without considering the intrinsic documents-generating structure on a subspace, thus leads to a limitation to uncover intrinsic semantic information. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised local-invariant method, called Discriminative Locally Document Embedding (Disc-LDE), aiming to build a smooth affine map for document embedding by preserving documents-generating structure on a subspace. Disc-LDE models the documents-generating structure as a pseudo-document by a generative probabilistic model of subspace, where the subspace is acquired by a transductive learning of multi-agent random walk on neighborhood graph, and regularizes the training of Auto-Encoders (AEs) to jointly recover the input document and its pseudo-document. Under a general regularized function learning framework, the regularized training can impact the parameterized encoder network become smooth to variations along the documents-generating structure of the local field on manifold. The experimental results on three widely-used corpora demonstrate Disc-LDE could efficient capture the intrinsic semantic structure to improve the clustering and classification performance to the state-of-the-arts methods.

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a widely used psychopathology screening tool that measures children's emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and prosocial behavior. Previous psychometric studies of the SDQ focused primarily on older children in Western cultures and suffered from several methodological limitations. This study examined the reliability, factor structure, convergent, and discriminant validity of the SDQ by focusing on young Asian American children and using more rigorous methods. The five-factor structure of the SDQ was confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. The coefficients indicated adequate reliability for all subscales except parent-rated peer problems and conduct problems. The correlated trait-correlated method minus one multitrait-multimethod model provided evidence for convergent validity and discriminant validity of all subscales except for conduct problems relative to hyperactivity/inattention. This study provided new evidence for the psychometric properties of the SDQ in young children and cultural suitability of the SDQ for Asian Americans.	2.4
The magnetic damper was introduced into the high speed rotating machinery to restrain the vibration of the rotor supported by active magnetic bearings. The experimental setup, which was made up of one rotor, two radial active magnetic bearings, one axial active magnetic bearing, one magnetic damper and control system, was built to investigate the effects of the magnetic damper locations on dynamic characteristics of the system by theoretical analysis, experimental modal analysis and actual operation of the system. The results show that the vibration of the active magnetic bearing system operating at the modal frequency can be reduced more effectively if the magnetic damper is located far from the nodes of the corresponding mode shape.	3.2
This paper presents a case history of geotextile-reinforced dry cover placement on a reclaimed clay deposit treated by progressive trenching method. In order to investigate the effects of the cover material's characteristic of ensuring trafficability with respect to bearing failure and ground deformation, two types of covers were considered in pilot tests: a layer of weathered granite soil cover and a layer of weathered granite soil over stiff crushed stone. A number of in-situ plate load tests were conducted for various cover conditions to assess the bearing capacity of the reclaimed deposit and to determine the thickness and material compositions that satisfy the bearing capacity requirement. In full-scale pilot tests for cover placement, field monitoring was carried out for the surface settlement and pore pressure that developed in the reclaimed clay layer. The results of plate-loading tests and monitoring during staged cover placements are discussed and compared using numerical predictions obtained from both finite element analyses and undrained stability analyses. The comparison results showed that the drainage condition of the ground surface facing the dry cover is strongly related to the ground response and stability.	4.1
Power grid interconnection has gained attention in Northeast Asia (NEA) as a means to effectively utilize the abundant renewable resources in Mongolia. This paper quantifies the potential economic and environmental benefits of deploying massive wind turbines and solar PV in Mongolia for power exports. The author uses an NEA-wide multi-region power system model formulated as a linear programming problem. The analysis considers power systems characteristics, such as the seasonal and daily electric load curves of the NEA regions. The simulation results show that the large-scale Mongolian renewables contribute to significant CO2 reductions in NEA. China, in particular, benefits from a significant reduction in coal-fired generation. However, huge investments would be required for the massive renewables and cross-boundary transmission facilities, pushing up electricity supply cost. The relevant planning organizations need to carefully consider these environmental opportunities and economic barriers before implementation. This paper also investigates the economic impacts of transmission route circuity due to avoiding transmission through the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Our results imply modest effects of the circuity on the total system cost; availability of routes through the DPRK would not significantly increase the benefits to the NEA system of integrating massive renewables in Mongolia.

Response inhibition has been suggested to be dysfunctional in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, this process involves intentional cognitive control, which does not correspond to the automatic emergence of stereotyped thoughts and behaviours usually reported by patients with OCD. In the present study, the excessive facilitation of unintentional processes was assessed in OCD by using the Computerized Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT). Seventy-six volunteers participated in this study, including 39 patients with OCD and 37 healthy controls. The CMPT was administered to all participants, and a score of appropriateness of the sensorimotor adaptation to the mirror inversion was computed from the initial deviation angle (IDA), that precedes the intentional readjustment of movement. Results showed that throughout the 40 trials of the CMPT, the IDA score remained significantly abnormal in patients with OCD in comparison with control participants. Further analyses of IDA scores in OCD revealed a clear tendency to keep a natural visuomotor processing that is rigid and unadapted to the mirror condition. Irrespective of the physical requirements of the environment, patients with OCD showed a strong tendency to initiate movements as per a previously consolidated - although unadapted- sensorimotor mapping. This suggests a tendency for an excessive facilitation of unintentional stereotyped processes. Further studies should be conducted on this question by using tasks sensitive to cognitive processes other than visuo-spatial abilities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.4
The first quantum private comparison (QPC) protocol via cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) is proposed in this paper by making full use of the evolution law of atom via cavity QED, where the third party (TP) is allowed to misbehave on his own but cannot conspire with either of the two users. The proposed protocol adopts two-atom product states rather than entangled states as the initial quantum resource, and only needs single-atom measurements for two users. Both the unitary operations and the quantum entanglement swapping operation are not necessary for the proposed protocol. The proposed protocol can compare the equality of one bit from each user in each round comparison with one two-atom product state. The proposed protocol can resist both the outside attack and the participant attack. Particularly, it can prevent TP from knowing two users' secrets. Furthermore, the qubit efficiency of the proposed protocol is as high as 50%.	0.3
Previous studies have noted that narcissists do, in some cases, experience benefits. The current study adds to this discussion by examining whether age might moderate the links between narcissism and a self-reported benefit (life satisfaction) and an observer-reported benefit (observer ratings of personality). In a sample of college students and their family members (N = 807), the authors demonstrate that narcissism positively correlates with life satisfaction for adolescents and emerging adults, but not for adult participants. In addition, the relationship between narcissism and observer-reported neuroticism was weakly negative for undergraduate students, but significant and positive for their mothers. Taken together, these results suggest that narcissism is more beneficial for adolescents and emerging adults than for adults. Both sets of analyses also pointed to the importance of studying narcissism as a multifaceted construct. Findings are discussed with respect to personality development theories that emphasize adult role adoption.	2.2
Aging is a cause of cognitive decline in the elderly and the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, however, aging people are not all destined to develop into cognitive deficits, the molecular mechanisms underlying this difference in cognition of aging people are obscure. Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation in the nervous system, play a critical role in regulation of gene expression for learning and memory. An inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) is reported to suppress histone acetylation via a histone-masking mechanism, and pp32 is a key component of INHAT complex. In the present study, we divided 18 m-old aged mice into the cognitive-normal and the cognitive-impaired group by Morris water maze, and found that pp32 level was significantly increased in the hippocampus of cognitive-impaired aged mice. The mRNA and protein levels of synaptic-associated proteins decreased with reduced dendrite complexity and histone acetylation. Knockdown of pp32 rescued cognitive decline in cognitive-impaired aged mice with restoration of synaptic-associated proteins, the increase of spine density and elevation of histone acetylation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the aging-associated cognitive disturbance, indicating that suppression of pp32 might represent a promising therapeutic approach for learning and memory impairments.	5.2
An integrated model for simulating and diagnosing water quality based on the system dynamics and Bayesian network (BN) is presented in the paper. The research aims to connect water monitoring downstream with outlet management upstream in order to present an efficiency outlet management strategy. The integrated model was built from two components: the system dynamics were used to simulate the water quality and the BN was applied to diagnose the reason for water quality deterioration according to the water quality simulation. The integrated model was applied in a case study of the Songhua River from the Baiqi section to the Songlin section to prove its reasonability and accuracy. The results showed that the simulation fit to the variation trend of monitoring data, and the average relative error was less than 10%. The water quality deterioration in the Songlin section was mainly found to be caused by the water quality in the upper reach and Hadashan Reservoir drain by using the diagnosis function of the integrated model based on BN. The relevant result revealed that the integrated model could provide reasonable and quantitative support for the basin manager to make a reasonable outlet control strategy to avoid more serious water quality deterioration.	4.4
This article draws an analogy between physical nonverbal gesture and the textual conventions of new and social media to argue that the vital nonverbal functions of face-to-face communication are not absent from digital media, but that communicative functions typically enacted nonverbally are transposed into new spaces of interaction afforded by synchronous and near-synchronous textual media. Digital and social media text is conversational text that fulfills the phatic needs of typical social interaction: 'keeping in touch' does not in any way constitute a cultural regression but represents the fundamental ground of human cognition, which is inescapably both social and technologically dependent. An analysis of examples from the popular microblogging service Twitter serves to illustrate the gestural functions of digital media text, including the enactment of mediated social 'spaces'. The closing section explores the theoretical implications for identity and agency of connecting embodied nonverbal communication to digital media communication that is all too often erroneously understood to be or implicitly approached as 'disembodied'.	2.3
4G WiMax offers a new parading regards to the way that the traditional wireless network systems have been designed all this happens due to the impact generating by technology in society and its impact in environmental ambient intelligence such smart cities (Sidi Bouzid area). the fundamental technological advantages of 4G WiMax superior radio technological advantages of 4G WiMax superior radio technology built in QOS and security, and an open IP-based access network infrastructure. This technology can be used for a number of applications, including last mile broadband connections, hotsposts and high speed connectivity for business customers. The objective of this article is to propose an approach to design a network on the latest standard of WiMax namely (802.16m), and to use it dimensioning and planning such network in Sidi-Bouzid area in order to optimize interferences, noise and to avoide cutout. In this article review of WiMax technology was given, followed by its standard with focusing on 802.16m standard. A design approach was developed to help network planner in their work to achieve the smart city in Sidi Bouzid of communications, this approach was summarized in a simple flow chart. As a case study, a network based on this technology was designed for Sidi Bouzid area. The number of subscriber was calculated for each district area and plotted in a clutter map. The Building Penetration Losses for each type of area were modeled using several measurements conducted as a part of this work, in fact we tried to minimize the noise and evry kind of interference. The design outcome (number of base station and there distribution) where found less than the existing ones in the operating network.	4.0
A general similarity solution for water-entry problems of a wedge with its inner angle fixed and its sides in expansion is obtained with flow detachment, in which the speed of expansion is a free parameter. The known solutions for a wedge of a fixed length at the initial stage of water entry without flow detachment and at the final stage corresponding to Helmholtz flow are obtained as two special cases, at some finite and zero expansion speeds, respectively. An expanding horizontal plate impacting a flat free surface is considered as the special case of the general solution for a wedge inner angle equal to pi. An initial impulse solution for a plate of a fixed length is obtained as the special case of the present formulation, The general solution is obtained in the form of integral equations using the integral hodograph method. The results are presented in terms of free-surface shapes, streamlines and pressure distributions.	3.4
BackgroundThe UK's NHS intends to move from the current Read code system to the international, detailed Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) to facilitate more clinically appropriate coding of conditions and associated risk factors and outcomes. Given concerns about coding behaviour of general practitioners, we sought to study the current coding patterns in allergies and identify lessons for the future migration to SNOMED-CT. MethodsData from 2 014 551 primary care consultations in over 100 000 patients with one or more of 11 potentially allergic diseases (anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma, conjunctivitis, drug allergies, eczema, food allergy, rhinitis, urticaria, venom allergy and other probable allergic disorders) from the Scottish Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit Research (PCCIU-R) database were descriptively analysed and visualized to understand Read code usage patterns. ResultsWe identified 352 Read codes for these allergic diseases, but only 36 codes (10%) were used in 95% of consultations; 73 codes (21%) were never used. Half of all usage was for Quality and Outcomes Framework codes for asthma. Despite 149 detailed codes (42%) being available for allergic triggers, these were infrequently used. ConclusionsThis analysis of Read codes use suggests that introduction of the more detailed SNOMED-CT, in isolation, will not improve the quality of allergy coding in Scottish primary care. The introduction of SNOMED-CT should be accompanied by initiatives aimed at improving coding quality, such as the definition of terms/codes, the availability of terminology browsers, a recommended list of codes and mechanisms to incentivize detailed coding of the condition and the underlying allergic trigger.	5.1
The main objective of this paper is to compare indicators based on energy consumption and financial savings to rank strategies to save potable water in buildings. The method is based on potable water savings, embodied energy, energy consumption for operation, and investment feasibility analysis; and it was applied to a school in the city of Florianopolis, southern Brazil. The strategies considered to save potable water were rainwater, greywater, water-efficient appliances, and their combinations. The embodied energy was estimated using indices of embodied energy per mass of material, and labour. The indicators used to rank the strategies were potential for potable water savings, index between potable water savings and embodied energy or total energy consumption, net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback, and index between potable water savings and initial costs. All strategies and combinations were feasible, but the use of water-efficient appliances was the best. Amongst the indicators used to rank the strategies, five of them led to the same ranking. Such indicators can be applied to rank potable water saving strategies in other types of buildings and climates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.3
Although aesthetic preferences are known to be important in person perception and can play a significant role in everyday social decisions, the effect of the age of the observer on aesthetic preferences for faces of different ages has not yet been fully investigated. In the present study we investigated whether aesthetic preferences change with aging, with an age-related bias in favoring faces from one's own age group. In addition, we examined the role of age on both the perceptual qualities and the social attributes of faces that may influence these aesthetic judgements. Both younger and older adult observers provided ratings to images of younger, middle-aged and older unfamiliar faces. As well as attractiveness, the rating dimensions included other perceptual (distinctiveness, familiarity) and social (competence, trustworthiness and dominance) factors. The results suggested a consistent aesthetic preference for youthful faces across all ages of the observers but, surprisingly, no evidence for an age-related bias in attractiveness ratings. Older adults tended to provide higher ratings of attractiveness, competence and trustworthiness to the unfamiliar faces, consistent with the positivity effect previously reported. We also tested whether perceptual factors such as face familiarity or distinctiveness affected aesthetic ratings. Only ratings of familiarity, but not distinctiveness, were positively associated with the attractiveness of the faces. Moreover, ratings of familiarity decreased with increasing age of the face. With regard to the social characteristics of the faces, we found that the age of the face negatively correlated with ratings of trustworthiness provided by all observers, but with the competence ratings of older observers only. Interestingly, older adults provided higher ratings of perceived competence and trustworthiness to younger than older faces. However, our results also suggest that higher attractiveness ratings, together with older aged faces, led to more positive evaluations of competence. The results are discussed within the context of an age-related decline in the differentiation of faces in memory. Our findings have important implications for a better understanding of age-related perceptual factors and cognitive determinants of social interactions with unfamiliar others across the adult lifespan.	2.2
Liver transplantation is a promising and widely-accepted treatment for patients with terminal liver disease. However, transplantation is restricted by the lack of suitable donors, resulting in significant waiting list deaths. This paper proposes a novel donor-recipient allocation system that uses machine learning to predict graft survival after transplantation using a dataset comprised of donor-recipient pairs from the King's College Hospital (United Kingdom). The main novelty of the system is that it tackles the imbalanced nature of the dataset by considering semi-supervised learning, analysing its potential for obtaining more robust and equitable models in liver transplantation. We propose two different sources of unsupervised data for this specific problem (recent transplants and virtual donor-recipient pairs) and two methods for using these data during model construction (a semi-supervised algorithm and a label propagation scheme). The virtual pairs and the label propagation method are shown to alleviate the imbalanced distribution. The results of our experiments show that the use of synthetic and real unsupervised information helps to improve and stabilise the performance of the model and leads to fairer decisions with respect to the use of only supervised data. Moreover, the best model is combined with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD), which is at the moment the most popular assignation methodology worldwide. By doing this, our decision-support system considers both the compatibility of the donor and the recipient (by our prediction system) and the recipient severity (via the MELD score), supporting then the principles of fairness and benefit.

Topology optimization is an important topic in structural mechanics. One common application is to obtain the optimal distribution of material that maximizes the stiffness of the solution (minimize the compliance). However, as an iterative process, topology optimization of large and complex structures is computationally intensive. The problem becomes even more complicated if the manufacturing constraints are taken into account in the optimization process. In this paper, a novel growth method based on principal stress lines (PSLs) is presented for topology optimization. The PSLs are traced in the design domain along the direction of principal stresses, in which the materials would be located to define the geometry and topology of the structure. Consequently, the optimization problem is converted into a geometric design problem. Compared to previous methods, the computation based on PSLs is fast, and the designer can have explicit control over the number of structural members. In addition, the manufacturing constraints can easily be incorporated. Multiple test cases are given to illustrate the presented method. The PSL-based method is promising for building practical designing tools for various structural applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.0
The present study examined whether the grade point averages (GPAs) of university students could be predicted from appearance-based ratings of their Conscientiousness. Undergraduate participants (N = 249) provided self-reports of their Big Five personality traits and copies of their student transcripts from which their GPAs were obtained. Photographs of these undergraduates were then taken from which their personality traits were judged by unacquainted perceivers. Both aggregated and single perceiver-ratings of Conscientiousness predicted GPA. Aggregated perceiver-ratings predicted GPA incrementally over self-ratings, suggesting that appearance-based judgements of Conscientiousness may contain trait-relevant information beyond the scope of self-reports. These results contribute to a growing literature documenting the validity of appearance-based judgements of personality traits.	2.2
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia and the trigger of its pathological cascade is widely believed to be the overproduction and accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (A beta) in the affected brain. However, effective AD remedies are still anxiously awaited. Recent evidence suggests that curcumin may be a potential agent for AD treatment. In this study, we used 5xFAD transgenic mice as an AD model to investigate the effects of curcumin on AD. Our results showed that curcumin administration (150 or 300 mg/kg/day, intragastrically, for 60 days) dramatically reduced A beta production by downregulating BACE1 expression, preventing synaptic degradation, and improving spatial learning and memory impairment of 5xFAD mice. These findings suggest that curcumin is a potential candidate for AD treatment.	5.2
BACKGROUND: Patients who have failed traditional treatment of chronic urticaria may require trials of alternative medications. Safety profiles, continuous laboratory monitoring, and physician comfort are often barriers to treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety of alternative agents used in chronic urticaria. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of electronic medical records from a single-center allergy and immunology clinic in a major academic hospital was conducted. One hundred twenty-six charts of patients with chronic urticaria treated with alternative agents were reviewed. RESULTS: Adverse effects were reported in 39 of 73 (53%) patients on dapsone, 19 of 47 (40%) patients on sulfasalazine, 15 of 36 (42%) patients on tacrolimus, 7 of 45 (16%) patients on hydroxychloroquine, 9 of 27 (33%) patients on mycophenolate, 6 of 8 (75%) patients on cyclosporine, and 3 of 24 (4%) patients on omalizumab. Most of these adverse effects were mild, did not require discontinuation of the medication, and resolved after stopping the medication or decreasing the dose. CONCLUSIONS: The use of alternative agents for the treatment of chronic urticaria angioedema is generally safe when proper laboratory and clinical monitoring is observed.

ObjectiveSeveral studies have reported that non-demented older adults with clinical depression show changes in amyloid- (A) levels in blood, cerebrospinal fluid and on neuroimaging that are consistent with those observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that A may be one of the mechanisms underlying the relation between the two conditions. We sought to determine the relation between elevated cerebral A and the presence of depression across a 54-month prospective observation period. MethodsCognitively normal older adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study who were not depressed and had undergone a positron emission tomography scan to classify them as either high A (n=81) or low A (n=278) participated. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form at 18-month intervals over 54months. ResultsWhilst there was no difference in probable depression between groups at baseline, incidence was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-16.4) times greater within the high A group (9%) than the low A group (2%) by the 54-month assessment. ConclusionsResults of this study suggest that elevated A levels are associated with a 4.5-fold increased likelihood of developing clinically significant depressive symptoms on follow-up in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This underscores the importance of assessing, monitoring and treating depressive symptoms in older adults with elevated A. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	5.2
This paper proposes an axial-flux-modulation permanent magnet (PM) machine and its sensorless control strategy for in-wheel application in electrical vehicles. A Vernier structure is integrated with the axial-flux PM machine to include the magnetic gear effect and improve output torque. The sensorless control strategy of the proposed machine, including initial rotor position estimation and rotating position estimation, is proposed for flux-modulation motors in this paper. The initial rotor position estimation is based on the technique of rectangular pulse voltage injection and the rotating rotor position estimation is based on the sliding mode observer (SMO). The saturation effect on inductances, which is the theoretical basis of the rectangular pulse voltage injection, makes the stator parameter variation in different loads and affects the SMO estimation. To overcome this problem, a novel online parameter self-adjustment procedure for the SMOis introduced. The machine design and its sensorless control performance are verified by simulation and prototype experiments.	3.3
In this article we address the increasingly important yet understudied phenomenon of nonnative accentedness on decision making. In three experimental studies, we investigated whether messages about a company delivered in nonstandard-American-accented speech influenced choice. In Study 1, we found that individuals were more likely to choose a company or a product when a message was read in a standard American English accent than when the message was delivered with a Mandarin Chinese or a French accent. In Study 2, we found that expectations regarding company messages are violated when speakers have accents and that, in turn, expectation violations mediated the relationship between accent and choice. In Study 3, we replicated the findings of the effect of accent on choice using Indian and British accents. We also hypothesized and found support for a conditional indirect effects model such that implicit pro-American bias moderated the indirect relationship between accent and choice as mediated by expectation violations. Theoretical and practical implications of this topic of study are discussed.	2.1
Purpose Application of zero valent iron nanoparticles is an innovative technology for ground water treatment and soil remediation. There are several methods to synthesise nano scale zero valent iron (nZVI), namely through bottom-up methods which consists on chemical reactions using strong reducing agents. In this work, the environmental impacts and costs were determined for two methods, namely the traditional one that uses sodium borohydride and the green method that uses extracts obtained from natural products. Methods The consideration of environment and economic aspects in the earlier stages of the synthesis processes and in the development of new materials is of great importance since it can help to decide if alternative methods are promising and should be further developed aiming more sustainable processes. In this work, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used as an ecodesign strategy evaluating environmental performance of the two synthesis methods, identifying critical stages of the synthesis processes of nZVI. An economic evaluation and a sensitivity analysis considering a different scenario for electricity production were also performed. Results and discussion The results obtained in this study showed that the green synthesis method presents lower environmental impacts than the traditional one, roughly 50% lower in the first scenario. In the second scenario, environmental impact of green synthesis corresponds to 38% of the environmental impact of traditional synthesis. In the green method, the critical stage is the extraction process which is closely related to the electricity production. In the traditional method, the reactant use is the critical stage that is related to the production of sodium borohydride. The economic evaluation indicated that the traditional synthesis method is much more expensive than the green synthesis (roughly eight times higher). Conclusions From the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that the green synthesis method presents lower environmental impacts in both scenarios and lower costs than the traditional synthesis.	1.0
Background. A previous small study suggested that Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel ERP-based brain network analysis, may have diagnostic utility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we examined the diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a larger population of adults with and without ADHD. Method. Subjects were unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a response inhibition task (Go/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed into a machine learning algorithm. Results. The BNA analysis of the EEG data recorded during the Go/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for the NoGo condition). Conclusions. BNA methodology can help differentiate between ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective evaluation of electro-physiological changes associated with ADHD. Results also support a network-based approach to the study of ADHD.	0.1
Background and objectives: Cognitive models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) highlight the role of cognitive biases for the development of the disorder. One of these biases, an inflated sense of responsibility has been associated with higher anger scores and latent aggression on self-report scales, especially in patients with compulsive checking. Validity of self-report assessment is, however, compromised by inaccuracy, social desirability, and low metacognitive awareness of traits and behaviors in patients. The aim of the present study was to extend the research on latent aggression in individuals with OCD by using an indirect, implicit measure of aggression. Methods: Fifty-eight patients with OCD and 25 healthy controls were assessed with an Aggressiveness Implicit Association Test (IAT), which is a reaction time task that assesses the strength of associations between the concept of aggressiveness and me compared to others. Results: Contrary to our expectation, OCD patients with checking symptoms showed a more peaceful implicit self-concept than healthy controls. This result was corroborated by negative correlations between checking symptoms and implicit aggressiveness in the OCD sample. Limitations: No self-report measures on aggression or anger were included in the study. Conclusions: In comparison to previous research using self-report measures, our study indicates that implicit aspects of aggression do indeed differ from controlled aspects in patients with checking compulsions. Future research is necessary to better understand the role of aggressiveness in OCD and to derive implications for therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	5.4
The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (JSLC) is a relatively isolated special zone in the northwest region of China. The potential risk to the energy supply security and the pressure of national greenhouse gas emissions reduction clearly indicates the JSLC's need to lower its dependency on imported fossil fuels and electricity. This article presents a feasibility analysis on the available hybrid energy system based on the renewable energy availability and local electricity demand estimation in 2020 through HOMER model. The simulation results indicate that cost of energy (COE) of the three proposed options are 0.127, 0.033 and 0.123 $/kWh, respectively. It also shows that the proposed hybrid renewable energy systems can reduce carbon emissions by 40-70% compared to electricity from the existing power grid. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the COE has a significant positive relationship with carbon price and discount rate, whereas carbon price shows a significantly distinct impact on the COE for different options considered. The optimization results also show that a grid-connected renewable power system comprised of wind power and natural gas power plant is the most economic and environment-friendly energy supply option for JSLC. However, a hybrid RE system with a local energy storage facility can better guarantee the energy supply safety considering the special function and security needs of the JSLC. This study verified that constructing new coal fired power plants is not a suitable choice from both the cost effectiveness and kenvironmental protection perspectives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The paper is devoted to the problem of fault detection in analog electrical circuits described by linear or nonlinear polynomial models. So-called data-driven method for fault detection is considered. This method assumes that parameters of the circuit under consideration may be unknown. It does not use methods of identification and allows checking whether or not parameters of some elements deviate considerably from their nominal values.	1.2
For sure, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming an ultimate part of next generation mobile networks. They are a master piece for Ubiquitous computing. Indeed, they sustain development of numerous paradigms/ technologies such as distributed ambient intelligence, context-awareness and future mobile networking (e.g., B4G and 5G). Battery life remains one of the crucial problems to handle. In this article we propose an infrastructure-based topology using mobile ferries (mobile micro-base stations). In real life, a ferry could be robot, bus, tram, train or any other engine scrutinizing periodically a given area. Yet, message ferries are moving along concentric annulus and may collect data generated by the static sensors (could be classic sensors, smart meters, wearable devices, etc.) randomly distributed on given area. Next, transmissions are performed in a ferry-to-ferry forwarding scheme till arriving at the sink. Considered ferries could sense themselves data and therefore behave as mobile sensors allowing better awareness on the area state [1-3]. Our scheme could also assist Machine-to-Machine communications to increase the network lifetime, with potentially some cognitive-radio capabilities and opportunistic detection and access. Our proposal can easily be integrated in a smart-city for better interaction and green communications. Next, we present a queueing model (queues with finite capacity) to handle the generated traffic and to analyze the behavior of mobile ferries. We provided a close-form expression for both end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. The main objective of this work is to improve the energy efficiency of the cognitive sensors by asking cognitive sensors to not care about forwarding data of each other except for urgent data, this latter point is out of the scope of the paper. These static sensors will only care about data sensing, which will reduce their individual energy consumption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.0
Introduction: Estimates of US adults with dementia differ widely and don't distinguish adults living in the community. Methods: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 120485 households in 21 states that used a cognitive decline module in 2011 were used. Data for both respondents and other adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) were included through proxy responses. Using responses to questions about the receipt of informal care for their SCD and diagnosed dementia, estimates were made for each state. Results: Overall, 2.9% (range: 1.5% in Tennessee to 5.3% in Arkansas) of all noninstitutionalized adults in these states received informal care for their SCD and 0.9% (range: 0.5% in Tennessee to 2.0% in Arkansas) were estimated to have dementia. Limiting results to respondents reduced estimates significantly. Discussion: Combined results for respondents and nonrespondents from a representative telephone survey provide varying estimates of SCD-related measures across states, highlighting the need for state-specific estimates.	5.2
One of the adverse effects of shrinking transistor sizes is that processors have become increasingly prone to hardware faults. At the same time, the number of cores per die rises. Consequently, core failures can no longer be ruled out, and future operating systems for many-core machines will have to incorporate fault tolerance mechanisms. We present CSR, a strategy for recovery from unexpected permanent processor faults in commodity operating systems. Our approach overcomes surprise removal of faulty cores, and also tolerates cascading core failures. When a core fails in user mode, CSR terminates the process executing on that core and migrates the remaining processes in its run-queue to other cores. We further show how hardware transactional memory may be used to overcome failures in critical kernel code. Our solution is scalable, incurs low overhead, and is designed to integrate into modern operating systems. We have implemented it in the Linux kernel, using Haswell's Transactional Synchronization Extension, and tested it on a real system.	0.4
The behavior of cells and how they react to stimuli is critically important for drug development, drug delivery, and understanding the molecular basis of many diseases. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of these interactions, particularly in relation to drug delivery from nanoparticles. This Sensors Issues article discusses the importance of quantifying these interactions and highlights some key areas where advances in sensor technology have the potential to transform our understanding of drug delivery and cell biology.	6.1
Introduction: Behcet's Disease (BD) is classified among vasculitides. The aim of this review was to put together different known reports in order to help the reader to better understand the disease, to avoid the frequent misdiagnosis, and to decide the best treatment.Areas covered: a) Epidemiology: BD is rare, and is seen along the Silk Road, from 20 to 420/100,000 in Turkey and 80/100,000 in Iran, to 0.64/100,000 in the UK. b) Clinical manifestations: oral aphthosis is seen in more than 95% of patients, genital aphthosis (60-90%), skin (pseudofolliculitis/erythema nodosum, 40-90%), eyes (uveitis/retinal vasculitis, 45-90%), gastrointestinal (diarrhea/hemorrhage/perforation/pain, 4-38%), vascular (venous/arterial thrombosis, aneurysm, 2.2-50%), neurological (all kinds, especially meningo-encephalitis, 2.3-38.5%), and articular (arthralgia/arthritis/ankylosing spondylitis, 11.6-93%). c) Pathergy test is positive in some patients: 8.6% (in India) to 70.7% (in China). This data was extracted from the five nationwide surveys and the largest case series from BD conference reports and a Pubmed search.Expert commentary: Diagnosis is clinical but classification/diagnosis criteria may help. The best criteria for BD is the International Criteria for Behcet's Disease (ICBD). BD is a multisystem disease progressing by attacks and remissions. Each attack may resemble the preceding or it may be different in duration, severity, and the systems involved.	5.3
Quantum secure direct communication can transmit a secret message directly through quantum channels without first generating a shared secret key. In the most of the existing protocols, quantum secure direct communication is possible only when both communicating participants have quantum capabilities. So what happens if either party of two participants just has classical capabilities? In this paper, we propose a semiquantum secure direct communication protocol with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen photon pairs in which the classical sender Bob transmits a secret message to quantum Alice directly. After checking the security of quantum channels, Bob encodes his secret message on Alice's code sequence. Then, quantum Alice extracts Bob's secret message by measuring her home qubits and the received code qubits, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate the security of the proposed protocol against some individual eavesdropping attacks. The efficiency analysis shows that our protocol can provide higher efficiency.	0.3
The present study investigates whether nonverbal behavioral cues to hidden criminal intentions during the build-up phase of a criminal act can be measured. To this end, we created recordings of actors once in a search situation and once committing a mock crime (theft or bomb placing) in a public crowded area. For ecological validation, we used authentic CCTV footage of real crimes in Experiment I. In this experiment, the two behavioral clusters pattern of movement in space and nonverbal communication behavior were analyzed. The results showed a deviance in pattern of movement in space for offenders' compared with the nonoffenders' condition as well as a bystanders' baseline. There was no significant difference between nonverbal communication behavior in the offenders' and nonoffenders' conditions. Experiment 2 was conducted to examine the two behavior clusters use of object- and self-adaptors while controlling for interpersonal differences. The results showed an increased use of object- and decreased use of self-adaptors during the build-up phase of a mock crime compared with a control condition (search). Thus, nonverbal behavior of offenders seems to differ from nonverbal behavior of nonoffenders. However, this holds only under the conditions of a valid baseline and of judging not only a single, typical behavioral cue but a whole cluster of nonverbal behaviors, such as pattern of movement in space or use of object-adaptors in general.	2.3
Infliximab (IFX) is an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody used to treat inflammatory joint diseases. Infusion reactions (IR) can occur during and after intravenous administration and often require discontinuation of IFX therapy. This retrospective study aimed at evaluating the incidence of IR in patients with joint inflammatory diseases receiving IFX with and without premedication. Clinical charts of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis patients receiving IFX from January 2002 to December 2014 were reviewed. Patients receiving only one premedication protocol over time were enrolled and clustered based on the type of premedication as follows: group 1 received no premedication; group 2 received paracetamol, esomeprazole, hydrocortisone, and chlorpheniramine maleate; group 3 received paracetamol, hydoxyzine, ranitidine, and 6-methylprednisolone. Adverse events were recorded during the infusion, in the following hours and at control visits. The charts of 105 patients treated with IFX were selected. IR were observed in 23/51 patients of group 1, in 7/35 patients of group 2, and none of 19 patients in group 3. IR incidence was significantly lower in the second (p = 0.021) and third (p < 0.001) compared to the first group. The incidence of IR was significantly lower in group 3 than group 2 (p < 0.043). Moreover, patients in group 1 had a relative risk of developing an IR 2.5 times higher than group 2. In our experience, the use of premedication significantly reduced the number of IR to IFX. In particular, the combination of paracetamol, hydroxyzine, 6-methylprednisolone and ranitidine was more efficacious than paracetamol, esomeprazole, hydrocortisone, and chlorpheniramine maleate combination protocol.	5.3
Ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation induces various changes in cell biology. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vanillin on UVA irradiation-induced damages in the sternness properties of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs). UVA-antagonizing mechanisms of vanillin were also examined. The results revealed that vanillin attenuated UVA-induced reduction of the proliferative potential and sternness of hAMSCs evidenced by increased proliferative activity in BrdU incorporation assay and upregulation of stemness-related genes (OCT4, NANOG and SOX2) in response to vanillin treatment. UVA-induced reduction in mRNA level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha was significantly recovered by vanillin. In addition, the antagonizing effect of vanillin on UVA was found to be mediated by reduced production of PGE(2) through inhibiting JNK and p38 MAPK. Taken together, these findings showed that vanillin could improve the reduced stemness of hAMSCs induced by UVA. The effect of vanillin is mediated by upregulating HIF-1 alpha via inhibiting PGE(2)-cAMP signaling. Therefore, vanillin might be used as an antagonizing agent to mitigate the effects of UVA.

After intense scientific exploration and more than a decade of failed trials, Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a fatal global epidemic. A traditional research and drug development paradigm continues to target heterogeneous late-stage clinically phenotyped patients with single 'magic bullet' drugs. Here, we propose that it is time for a paradigm shift towards the implementation of precision medicine (PM) for enhanced risk screening, detection, treatment, and prevention of AD. The overarching structure of how PM for AD can be achieved will be provided through the convergence of breakthrough technological advances, including big data science, systems biology, genomic sequencing, blood-based biomarkers, integrated disease modeling and P4 medicine. It is hypothesized that deconstructing AD into multiple genetic and biological subsets existing within this heterogeneous target population will provide an effective PM strategy for treating individual patients with the specific agent(s) that are likely to work best based on the specific individual biological make-up. The Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) is an international collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted towards the implementation of PM in Neurology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience. It is hypothesized that successful realization of PM in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will result in breakthrough therapies, such as in oncology, with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses, particularly through biomarker-guided early preclinical disease-stage clinical trials.	5.2
Noise addition is a data distortion technique widely used in data intensive applications. For example, in machine learning tasks it helps to reduce overfitting, whereas in data privacy protection it adds uncertainty to personally identifiable information. Yet, due to its mathematical operating principle, noise addition is a method mainly intended for continuous numerical data. In fact, despite the large amount of nominal data that are being currently compiled and used in data analysis, only a few alternative techniques have been proposed to distort nominal data in a similar way as standard noise addition does for numerical data. Furthermore, all these alternative methods rely on the distribution of the data rather than on the semantics of nominal values, which negatively affects the utility of the distorted outcomes. To tackle this issue, in this paper we present a semantically-grounded alternative to numerical noise suitable for nominal data, which we name semantic noise. By means of semantic noise, and by exploiting structured knowledge sources such as ontologies, we are able to distort nominal data while preserving better their semantics and thus, their analytical utility. To that end, we provide semantically and mathematically coherent versions of the statistical operators required in the noise addition process, which include the difference, the mean, the variance and the covariance. Then, we propose semantic noise addition algorithms that cope with the finite, discrete and non-ordinal nature of nominal data. The proposed algorithms cover both uncorrelated noise addition, which is suited to independent attributes, and correlated noise addition, which can cope with multivariate datasets with dependent attributes. Empirical results show that our proposals offer general and configurable mechanisms to distort nominal data while preserving data semantics better than baseline methods based only on the distribution of the data.

Attachment has recently been proposed as a key developmental construct in psychosis, in particular with respect to interpersonal functioning and social cognition. The current study examined the latent structure of the self-report Psychosis Attachment Measure (PAM) and its relationship to lower-level perceptual and higher-order inferential social cognitive processes. The PAM was administered to 138 psychiatrically stable outpatients with schizophrenia alongside a battery of symptom, social cognitive, and functional measures. PAM responses were analyzed using latent variable measurement models, which did not yield evidence of the coherent two-dimensional structure predicted by previous literature. A unidimensional subscale comprising 6 of the 16 original PAM items possessed the strongest psychometric properties. This subscale was generally uncorrelated with social cognitive measures and showed weak correlations with some symptoms measures and with community functioning. These results suggest that either the PAM may not measure attachment in psychosis or it may measure only attachment anxiety but demonstrate little construct validity in this population. These results tell a cautionary tale regarding making theoretical inferences on the basis of measures without coherent latent structure. Attachment measures with stronger psychometric properties will help clarify putative relationships between attachment and social cognitive processes in psychosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Imbalance between the production and clearance of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides is considered to be the primary mechanism of AD pathogenesis. This amyloid hypothesis is supported by the recent success of the human anti-amyloid antibody aducanumab, in clearing plaque and slowing clinical impairment in prodromal or mild patients in a phase Ib trial. Here, a peptide combining polyarginines (polyR) (for charge repulsion) and a segment derived from the core region of A beta amyloid (for sequence recognition) was designed. The efficacy of the designed peptide, R-8-A beta(25-35), on amyloid reduction and the improvement of cognitive functions were evaluated using APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. Daily intranasal administration of PEI-conjugated R-8-A beta(25-35) peptide significantly reduced A beta amyloid accumulation and ameliorated the memory deficits of the transgenic mice. Intranasal administration is a feasible route for peptide delivery. The modular design combining polyR and aggregate-forming segments produced a desirable therapeutic effect and could be easily adopted to design therapeutic peptides for other proteinaceous aggregate-associated diseases.	5.2
Australian undergraduate programs are implementing curriculum aimed at better preparing graduates to work in culturally diverse settings, but there remains uncertainty over the role of extant student attitudes towards Indigenous Australians. To begin to address this, we obtained baseline data on student attitudes upon entry to tertiary education. 1175 health science first-year students (275 males, 897 females) completed an anonymous in-class paper questionnaire. On average, students reported positive attitudes towards Indigenous Australians, with female students reporting more positive attitudes than male and domestic students more positive than international. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that after controlling for demographic variables, interactional diversity experiences and attitudes accounted for significant variance in a range of measures of preparedness to work in Indigenous health contexts. The knowledge gained will inform the development of, and alignment between, curriculum and pedagogical approaches, leading to an improved facilitation model for educators in the Indigenous Studies context.	2.0
Background: Abnormally invasive placenta (AIP) or placenta accreta (PA) is considered numerous adverse maternal and fetal-neonatal complications. There has been no detailed study to characterize the prevalence of AIP among deliveries in mainland China. Objectives: We aimed to fill this gap and obtained overall and regional estimates of AIP prevalence via a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was totally performed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for systematic reviews of observational studies, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Results: A total of 23 articles (including 350,939) were included. Most studies (22) focused on the placenta increta (PI), only 2 articles in PA, and none in placenta percreta (PP). In this meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of AIP was 0.22% (95% confidence interval 0.18%-0.27%) in a heterogeneous set of studies (I-2= 93.5%). In a subgroup, the prevalence of PA and PI was 0.48% and 0.23%, respectively. Stratified analyses of PI found that the prevalence was similar in North (0.23% [0.14%-0.32%]) and South (0.23% [0.15%-0.32%]), and lower in Central (0.20% [0.09-0.31%]); the inlanders (0.17% (0.12%-0.23%]) had a lower prevalence of PI than those living in coastal areas (0.24% [0.35%-0.63%]). As time goes on, the prevalence, from 0.03% (0.02%-0.04%) in 1970 to 1979 to 0.48% (0.30%-0.66%) in 2010 to present, was higher and higher. The different prevalence was also found in different in maternal age groups. Conclusions: This first systematic review and meta-analysis found that the prevalence differed among different geographic areas and maternal age groups. The results would be useful for the design of abnormally invasive placenta planning and implementation adequate health care systems and treatment programs in mainland China.	5.3
Sulphide-bearing mill wastes of the Ursk Ore Processing Plant situated in the Kemerovo region (Russia) were investigated in the 2013 - 2015. Multipurpose studies of the Ursk mining tailings allowed to determine the composition of the wastes pore waters, acid mine drainages and affected groundwater. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to trace the geoelectric zoning of the wastes, expressed as a consistent change of the electrical resistivity from zone to zone. Layers with low resistivity indicate areas with pore spaces filled by highly mineralized solutions with high concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, As, and Sb up to 12 g/L in total.	4.4
Research regarding stroke indicates that short elapsed time between accident and treatment can be fundamental to allow saving patient's life and avoid future sequels. This paper describes a model for monitoring and rescue victims in situations of possible stroke occurrence. It uses stroke symptoms that can be monitored by mobile equipment, ambient intelligence and artificial neural networks. The model is independent from human operation and applications or third parties devices, therefore adding facilities to increase the quality of life for people with stroke sequel, due to constant monitoring and follow-up provided, allowing the stroke patient to consider a recovery period with greater autonomy. A prototype based on free software platforms was developed, in order to assess the accuracy and the time elapsed between the prototype to detect and to send an alert. The results indicate a positive outlook for the work continuity.	4.0
Methods and materials for liquid encapsulation in thin (19 mu m) silicone membranes are presented in this work. A set of 12 liquids including solvents, oils, silicone pre-polymers and one ionic liquid are experimentally tested. We show that all selected liquids are chemically inert to silicone and that vapor pressure is the key parameter for stable encapsulation. It is demonstrated that encapsulated volume of silicone pre-polymers and ionic liquids can stay stable for more than 1 month. The actuation of dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) in conductive liquids is also investigated. An analysis of the equivalent electrical circuits of immersed DEAs shows that non-overlapping regions of the electrodes should be minimized. It also provides guidelines to determine when the electrodes should be passivated. The effects of immersion in a conductive liquid are assessed by measuring the actuation strain and capacitance over periodic actuation. The experimental results show no sign of liquid-induced degradation over more than 45k actuation cycles.	1.2
One of the crucial issues regarding a storm sewer system is the ability to avoid sediment depositions on the pipe invert. In this study, the mean flow velocity under the limit of sediment deposition conditions in partially filled circular storm sewers is evaluated through the use of a support vector machine (SVM) model coupled with the firefly algorithm (FFA). The aforemetioned velocity, defined as the velocity at the limit of deposition, and the parameters upon which it depends have been nondimensionalized using the Buckingham. theorem. Therefore, once the dimensionless parameters are identified, six different functional relationships in terms of dimensionless groups can be obtained. The effects of each of these functional relationships on the dimensionless velocity at limit of deposition, defined as the densimetric particle Froude number at the limit of deposition, have been analyzed by using, respectively, the SVM-FFA model, SVM model, genetic programming (GP) model, and artificial neural network (ANN) model. Five statistical indices have been used for evaluating the performance of each model (both in training and test phases) and, later, for comparing the performance of the different models between them. Finally, the predicted densimetric particle Froude number values obtained through the proposed SVM-FFA model have been compared with those obtained by three different dimensionless equations for velocity at the limit of deposition. The results indicate that SVM-FFA predicts the densimetric particle Froude number at limit of deposition fairly accurately. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.	0.1
MutS alpha is a key component in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. This protein is responsible for initiating the signaling pathways for DNA repair or cell death. Herein we investigate this heterodimer's post-recognition, post-binding response to three types of DNA damage involving cytotoxic, anti-cancer agents-carboplatin, cisplatin, and FdU. Through a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques along with more traditional structural and kinetic analysis applied to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, we predict that MutS alpha has a distinct response to each of the three damage types. Via a binary classification tree (a supervised machine learning technique), we identify key hydrogen bond motifs unique to each type of damage and suggest residues for experimental mutation studies. Through a combination of a recently developed clustering (unsupervised learning) algorithm, RMSF calculations, PCA, and correlated motions we predict that each type of damage causes MutSa to explore a specific region of conformation space. Detailed analysis suggests a short range effect for carboplatin-primarily altering the structures and kinetics of residues within 10 angstroms of the damaged DNA-and distinct longer-range effects for cisplatin and FdU. In our simulations, we also observe that a key phenylalanine residue-known to stack with a mismatched or unmatched bases in MMR-stacks with the base complementary to the damaged base in 88.61% of MD frames containing carboplatinated DNA. Similarly, this Phe71 stacks with the base complementary to damage in 91.73% of frames with cisplatinated DNA. This residue, however, stacks with the damaged base itself in 62.18% of trajectory frames with FdU-substituted DNA and has no stacking interaction at all in 30.72% of these frames. Each drug investigated here induces a unique perturbation in the MutSa complex, indicating the possibility of a distinct signaling event and specific repair or death pathway (or set of pathways) for a given type of damage.	0.1
Because parasitism is thought to play a major role in shaping host genomes, it has been predicted that genomic regions associated with resistance to parasites should stand out in genome scans, revealing signals of selection above the genomic background. To test whether parasitism is indeed such a major factor in host evolution and to better understand host-parasite interaction at the molecular level, we studied genome-wide polymorphisms in 97 genotypes of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna originating from three localities across Europe. Daphniamagna is known to coevolve with the bacterial pathogen Pasteuria ramosa for which host genotypes (clonal lines) are either resistant or susceptible. Using association mapping, we identified two genomic regions involved in resistance to P. ramosa, one of which was already known from a previous QTL analysis. We then performed a naive genome scan to test for signatures of positive selection and found that the two regions identified with the association mapping further stood out as outliers. Several other regions with evidence for selection were also found, but no link between these regions and phenotypic variation could be established. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that parasitism is driving host genome evolution.	6.4
Background: There is growing recognition that chronic cocaine users have alterations in sensorimotor control that are positively related to low frontal-striatal connectivity within the motor system. These frontal-striatal motor circuits however, are modulated by circuits governing attention, which are also disrupted in cocaine users. This study's aim was to determine if sensorimotor control deficits are positively related to the difficulty of a motor task or exist independent of the increasing cognitive demand. Methods: Functional MRI data was collected from 40 individuals (20 non-treatment seeking chronic cocaine users, 20 age and gender matched non-drug using controls) as they mimicked an unpredictable finger-tapping sequence at various speeds. Dependent measures included task accuracy, percent BOLD signal change in sensorimotor regions of interest (ROIs), and functional connectivity (temporal correlations) between ROIs. Results: In both groups, as speed increased, the BOLD signal change increased in the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), cerebellum, and anterior cingulate cortex. Compared to controls, cocaine user SMA-Caudate and ACC-Putamen connectivity was lower at all speeds in the contralateral hemisphere. Furthermore, as speed increased there was a decrease in connectivity between additional ROI pairs among users. Conclusions: These data support previous observations of sensorimotor performance deficits and dorsal frontal-striatal connectivity impairments among cocaine users. While previous studies demonstrate these deficits when performing a finger-tapping task at a single speed, we show that these same impairments exist at multiple levels of task difficulty. These data suggest that previously observed frontalstriatal connectivity in cocaine users during sensorimotor task performance are stable and not directly related to cognitive demands of the task.

In this paper, we elaborate on the premises of studying problem substance use and treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities. Due to the growing medicalisation of research on problem substance use and disparities in this group, policy makers, health researchers and practitioners often feel compelled to rely on epidemiological studies when grounding and understanding the link between ethnicity, problem substance use and treatment disparities. We argue that the bulk of epidemiological research suffers from crucial methodological and conceptual flaws that necessitate a reconsideration of their usefulness in policy and treatment practice. First, epidemiological research is based on static concepts of ethnicity and race as primordial analytical categories. Second, and as a consequence of the first argument, such research rarely distinguishes sufficiently between ethnic and non-ethnic determinants and mechanisms influencing problem substance use and treatment disparities. And third, these studies often depart from methodological individualism and subordinate contextual and structural determinants and mechanisms. This paper aims to re-evaluate (the factors and mechanisms mediating) the relationship between ethnicity, the nature of problem substance use, and treatment disparities, and to overcome some of the gaps in existing research methods mentioned above. More specifically, this implies (1) a critical revision of the ethnicity concept in epidemiology, (2) the inclusion of non-ethnic determinants and mechanisms by means of applying intersectional analysis and ethnic boundary making perspectives, (3) the broadening of methodological individualism in order to include all levels (from micro to macro) and loci (individual, community, society) of research in holistic research designs. Such doubled research allows researchers to analyse and have an impact on treatment disparities among migrants and ethnic minorities.	5.0

Once considered exclusively the cell's powerhouse, mitochondria are now recognized to perform multiple essential functions beyond energy production, impacting most areas of cell biology and medicine. Since the emergence of molecular biology and the discovery of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA defects in the 1980's, research advances have revealed a number of common human diseases which share an underlying pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria undergo function-defining dynamic shape changes, communicate with each other, regulate gene expression within the nucleus, modulate synaptic transmission within the brain, release molecules that contribute to oncogenic transformation and trigger inflammatory responses systemically, and influence the regulation of complex physiological systems. Novel mitopathogenic mechanisms are thus being uncovered across a number of medical disciplines including genetics, oncology, neurology, immunology, and critical care medicine. Increasing knowledge of the bioenergetic aspects of human disease has provided new opportunities for diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and in connecting various domains of medicine. In this article, we overview specific aspects of mitochondrial biology that have contributed to - and likely will continue to enhance the progress of modem medicine. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has attracted attention for its role in various behavioral and brain functions, and as a therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric disease states, including anxiety disorders and other conditions resulting from dysfunctional responses to stress. In this mini-review, we highlight components of the eCB system that offer potential 'druggable' targets for new anxiolytic medications, emphasizing some of the less well-discussed options. We discuss how selectively amplifying eCBs recruitment by interfering with eCB-degradation, via fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), has been linked to reductions in anxiety-like behaviors in rodents and variation in human anxiety symptoms. We also discuss a non-canonical route to regulate eCB degradation that involves interfering with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Next, we discuss approaches to targeting eCB receptor-signaling in ways that do not involve the cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (CB1R); by targeting the CB2R subtype and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). Finally, we review evidence that cannabidiol (CBD), while representing a less specific pharmacological approach, may be another way to modulate eCBs and interacting neurotransmitter systems to alleviate anxiety. Taken together, these various approaches provide a range of plausible paths to developing novel compounds that could prove useful for treating trauma-related and anxiety disorders.

Solvent excluded surface (SES) is one of the most popular surface definitions in biophysics and molecular biology. In addition to its usage in biomolecular visualization, it has been widely used in implicit solvent models, in which SES is usually immersed in a Cartesian mesh. Therefore, it is important to construct SESs in the Eulerian representation for biophysical modeling and computation. This work describes a software package called Eulerian solvent excluded surface (ESES) for the generation of accurate SESs in Cartesian grids. ESES offers the description of the solvent and solute domains by specifying all the intersection points between the SES and the Cartesian grid lines. Additionally, the interface normal at each intersection point is evaluated. Furthermore, for a given biomolecule, the ESES software not only provides the whole surface area, but also partitions the surface area according to atomic types. Homology theory is utilized to detect topological features, such as loops and cavities, on the complex formed by the SES. The sizes of loops and cavities are measured based on persistent homology with an evolutionary partial differential equation-based filtration. ESES is extensively validated by surface visualization, electrostatic solvation free energy computation, surface area and volume calculations, and loop and cavity detection and their size estimation. We used the Amber PBSA test set in our electrostatic solvation energy, area, and volume validations. Our results are either calibrated by analytical values or compared with those from the MSMS software. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	6.0
Although studies often find racial disparities in policing outcomes, less is known about how suspect race biases police interactions as they unfold. This study examines what is differentially occurring during police-suspect interactions for White, Black, and Latino suspects across time. It is hypothesized that racial bias may be more evident earlier in interactions, when less information about the situation is available. One hundred thirty-nine (62 White, 42 Black, and 35 Latino) use-of-force case files and associated written narratives from a medium to large size urban police department in the United States were analyzed. Trained coders broke down the interaction narratives into discrete sequences, or dyadic action-reaction steps involving a suspect action (level of resistance) and an officer response (level of force). A linear mixed-effects model was run on amount of police use of force by suspect race and time, with suspect resistance and suspect actions toward third-party/self as controls. Results demonstrated that Black and Latino suspects receive more force in the beginning stages of the interaction, whereas Whites escalated in level of force faster after initial levels. By breaking down police-suspect interactions into discrete sequences, the current study reveals a better understanding of when bias originates in police use of force and informs how to focus policing interventions.	2.0
One of the important tasks for most network security solutions is to track network flows in real-time. The universe of flow identifiers being huge, hash tables with their fast operations are well suited for this task. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional hash tables, the research community have come up with different improved variants; two of the well-knowns being Cuckoo and Peacock hash tables. Yet, network flows have interesting characteristics that can be exploited for tracking flows more efficiently. Besides, the existing hash tables are vulnerable to attacks. In this context, we design, develop and evaluate REX, a resilient and efficient data structure for tracking of network flows. REX is designed to make good use of, both, the characteristics of Internet traffic, as well as the different memory technologies. REX stores most commonly updated flows in the faster and smaller SRAM, while storing the rest in DRAM. We conducted extensive experiments using real network traffic to evaluate and compare REX, Cuckoo and Peacock hash tables. The results demonstrate, under both normal and attack scenarios, that REX not only rejects the least number of packets, but also significantly reduces the total time taken for the important hash table operations.

It is well known that electrostatic discharges can ignite mixtures of flammable gases with air and suspensions of combustible dust in air. For this reason, the prevention of electrostatic discharges is an essential part of measures to prevent explosions and fires. Incendive electrostatic discharges occurred in five cases in various chemical plants. The incidents involved were: 1. Spark type electrostatic discharges from a leaking steam pipe. 2. Spark type electrostatic discharges inside a charging chute for a solid. 3. A spark type electrostatic discharge whilst transferring a solid powder from a bin, which led to ignition of the powder. 4. A propagating brush discharge during pneumatic transfer of solid, which caused a severe electric shock to a process operator. 5. A brush discharge inside an electrostatic precipitator which caused ignition of an aerosol of hydrocarbon. To avoid explosions and fires it is important to prevent incendive electrostatic discharges from occurring in industrial facilities. To help managers of chemical plants to do this, the incidents above are presented in the form of learning lessons including: the mechanism of the generation and separation of electrical charges, the mechanism of the electrostatic discharge, the root causes of the incident, the safety measures which are necessary to avoid a repetition.

Side-channel attacks have emerged as the nondestructive threats of security vulnerability in cryptographic hardware. This paper provides an overview of the protection techniques with counter ways of utilizing sidechannel information leakage for combatting side-channel attacks as well as securing the authenticity of devices against counterfeits or even falsification.	0.3
Background: Crustaceans have been studied extensively as model systems for nervous system function from single neuron properties to behavior. However, lack of molecular sequence information and tools have slowed the adoption of these physiological systems as molecular model systems. In this study, we sequenced and performed de novo assembly for the nervous system transcriptomes of two decapod crustaceans: the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) and the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Results: Forty-two thousand, seven hundred sixty-six and sixty thousand, two hundred seventy-three contigs were assembled from C. borealis and H. americanus respectively, representing 9,489 and 11,061 unique coding sequences. From these transcripts, genes associated with neural function were identified and manually curated to produce a characterization of multiple gene families important for nervous system function. This included genes for 34 distinct ion channel types, 17 biogenic amine and 5 GABA receptors, 28 major transmitter receptor subtypes including glutamate and acetylcholine receptors, and 6 gap junction proteins - the Innexins. Conclusion: With this resource, crustacean model systems are better poised for incorporation of modern genomic and molecular biology technologies to further enhance the interrogation of fundamentals of nervous system function.	6.0
The increasing usage of smartphones in daily life has received considerable attention in academic and industry driven research to be utilized in the health sector. There has been development of a variety of health-related smartphone applications. Currently, however, there are few to none applications based on nurses' historical or behavioral preferences. Mobile application development for the health care sector requires extensive attention to security, reliability, and accuracy. In nursing applications, the users are often required to navigate in hospital environments, select patients to support, read the patient history and set action points to assist the patient during their shift. Finally, they have to report their performance on patient related activities and other relevant information before they leave for the day. In a working day, a nurse often visits different locations such as the patient's room, different laboratories, and offices for filling reports. There is still a limited capability to access context relevant information on a smartphone with minimal recourse such as Wi-Fi triangulation. The Wi-Fi triangulation signals fluctuate significantly for indoor location positioning. Therefore, providing relevant location based services to a mobile subscriber has become challenging. This paper addresses this gap by applying machine learning and behavior analysis to anticipate the potential location of the nurse and provide the required services. The application concept was already presented at the IMCOM 2015 conference. This paper focuses on the process to ascertain a user's context, the process of analyzing and predicting user behavior, and finally, the process of displaying the information through a dynamically generated UI.	0.1
Current centralized urban water supply depends largely on energy consumption, creating critical water-energy challenge especially for many rapid growing Asian cities. In this context, harvesting rooftop rainwater for non-potable use has enormous potential to ease the worsening water-energy issue. For this, we propose a geographic information system (GIS)-simulation-based design system (GSBDS) to explore how rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs) can be systematically and cost-effectively designed as an innovative water-energy conservation scheme on a city scale. This GSBDS integrated a rainfall data base, water balance model, spatial technologies, energy-saving investigation, and economic feasibility analysis based on a case study of eight communities in the Taipei metropolitan area, Taiwan. Addressing both the temporal and spatial variations in rainfall, the GSBDS enhanced the broad application of RWHS evaluations. The results indicate that the scheme is feasible based on the optimal design when both water and energy-savings are evaluated. RWHSs were observed to be cost-effective and facilitated 21.6% domestic water-use savings, and 138.6 (kWh/year-family) energy-savings. Furthermore, the cost of per unit-energy-saving is lower than that from solar PV systems in 85% of the RWHS settings. Hence, RWHSs not only enable water-savings, but are also an alternative renewable energy-saving approach that can address the water-energy dilemma caused by rapid urbanization.	4.3
Cell patterning has been widely used in research on fundamental cell biology and in applications such as tissue engineering, neuron network formation, cell based biosensor and drug screening. Although various methods have been developed, cell patterning in an enclosed microfluidic device at single cell level remains challenging. This paper describes a microfluidic device with microwells and protein patterns paired together in a single microchannel for an easy cell patterning. Cells captured in the microwells were positioned directly onto the protein patterns within 5 min and the patterning performance was successfully demonstrated using HeLa cells and human gallbladder carcinoma cells (SGC-996). Cells survived for 6 days in the microchannel. Cell attachment, migration, proliferation and cell colony formation were observed. Our device is free of topographic constraint for the patterned cells and no complex chemical modification to the substrate is needed, offering a simple, fast, and easy-to-operate way of patterning cells at single cell level in an enclosed microfluidic channel.	6.1
Hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-PDBEs) are exogenous, bioactive compounds that originate, to a large extent, from anthropogenic activities, although they are also naturally produced in the environment. In the present study nine new authentic OH-PBDE reference standards and their corresponding methyl ether derivatives (MeO-PBDEs) were synthesised and characterised by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Seven of the authentic reference standards prepared were thereafter tentatively identified in a pooled human blood sample. The tentatively identified OH-PBDEs were 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether, 3'-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',6-pentabromodiphenyl ether, 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether, 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether. 3'-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether, 3-hydroxy-2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromodiphenyl ether and 4-hydroxy-2,2',3,4',5,5',6-heptabromodiphenyl ether. An additional seven OH-PBDEs were tentatively identified in the pooled human blood sample, of which one OH-PBDE, 4'-hydroxy-2,2',4,5,5'-pentabromodiphenyl ether, has not been identified in human blood before. The identification was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) recording the bromine ions m/z 79, 81. The tentative identification was supported by the peaks relative retention times (RRTs) compared to authentic references on two GC columns of different polarities for the hexa-, and heptabrominated OH-PBDEs, and three different GC columns for the pentabrominated OH-PBDEs. The OH-PBDE congeners most likely originate from human metabolism of a flame retardant, i.e. polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), due to the relatively high concentrations of PBDEs in the same human blood sample and the fact that these PBDEs could form the tentatively identified OH-PBDEs via metabolic direct hydroxylation or via 1,2-shift.

A person's judgeability, or the extent to which a person is easy to understand, plays an important role in how accurately a target will be perceived by others. Research on this topic, however, has not been systematic or well-integrated. The current review begins to remedy this by integrating the available research on judgeability from the fields of personality perception, nonverbal communication, and social cognition. Specifically, this review summarizes the characteristics that are likely to promote judgeability and explores its potential consequences. A diverse range of characteristics are identified as predictors of judgeability, all relating to three broader categories: psychological adjustment, social status, and socialization. Furthermore, being judgeable has a variety of potential, largely positive, consequences for the target, leaving good targets poised for greater personal and interpersonal well-being. Nevertheless, many questions on this topic remain and it is crucial for this relatively understudied topic to receive more systematic empirical attention.	2.2
Introduction: The accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has not been fully validated in autopsied nonamnestic dementias. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated CSF amyloid beta 1-42, phosphorylated-tau, and amyloid-tau index as predictors of Alzheimer pathology in patients with primary progressive aphasia, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Results: Nineteen nonamnestic autopsied cases with relevant CSF values were included. At autopsy, nine had AD and 10 had non-AD pathologies. All six patients whose combined CSF phosphorylatedtau and amyloid b levels were consistent with AD had postmortem Alzheimer pathology. The two patients whose biomarker values were not consistent with AD had non-AD pathologies. The CSF values of the remaining eight non-AD cases were in conflicting or borderline ranges. Discussion: CSF biomarkers reliably identified Alzheimer pathology in nonamnestic dementias and may be useful as a screening measure for inclusion of nonamnestic cases into Alzheimer's trials.

Most bias crime literature focuses on adults despite the fact that youth account for a large proportion of prejudice-motivated violence. The LA County Commission on Human Relations data for all bias crimes from 2002-2008 was used to examine similarities and differences between adult and youth suspects of bias-motivated crimes. Findings showed youth victims of racial bias crimes were 12 times more likely to be targeted by youth suspects and over five times more likely to commit property offenses. Public places were nearly three times more likely than resident places to be the location of the bias crime by youth suspects. Female perpetrators of racial bias crimes were two times more likely to be youths. Implications of the findings are discussed.	2.0
Welding is the most important joining technique and offers the advantage of customizable plate thicknesses. On the other hand, welding causes residual stresses and deformations influencing the load carrying capacity. Their consideration in the design requires simple and fast models. Though welding simulation has contributed to accurately access to these values nowadays, their application to large components remains still in a less practicable range. Nevertheless, many studies emphasized the need to make corrections in recently available simplified models. Especially the influence of residual stresses seems somewhat overestimated in many cases if comparing conventional structural steel S355 and high-strength steel S690. In times of computer-aided design, an improved procedure to implement weld-inducted imperfections appears overdue. This will be presented in two parts. The first part illustrates the potential influence of post-welding imperfections exemplified for weak axis buckling in comparison with the general method in accordance with Eurocode 3. Residual stresses and initial crookedness were varied systematically in order to produce a scatter band of capacities. An approach to characterize the borders of these imperfections was untertaken before that. The excessive scattering of reduction factors for the load bearing capacity demonstrates the importance of these variables. Results were finally evaluated against advanced simulation models which will be further detailed in part two of this contribution.	3.0
Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have been developed for over twenty years and have been widely deployed in computer networks to detect a variety of network attacks. But one of the major limitations is that these systems would generate a large number of alarms, especially false alarms (positives) during the detection. To address this issue, many machine learning approaches have been applied to reduce NIDS false positives. However, we notice that multi-view based approach is often ignored by the literature, which uses one function to model a particular view and jointly optimizes all the functions to optimize and improve the learning performance. In addition, most existing studies have not implemented their algorithms into practical alam systems. In this paper, we thus develop MVPSys, a practical multi-view based false alarm reduction system to reduce false alarms more efficiently, where each view represents a set of features. More specifically, we implement a semi-supervised learning algorithm to construct two-view items and automatically exploit both labeled and unlabeled data. That is, this system can automatically extract and organize features from an incoming alarm into two feature sets: destination feature set and source feature set, where the former contains the features related to the target environment and the latter contains the features about the source environment. In the evaluation, we deploy our system into two real network environments besides using two datasets. Experimental results indicate that our system can achieve a stable filtration accuracy of over 95%, offering a significant improvement as compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Simulation becomes an more and more important aspect within digital factory planning. The virtual commissioning (VC) of automated plants in the production industry is a promising method to ensure both quality and adherence to delivery dates during this process. However, building simulation models is often paired with high efforts that stand against the benefits of VC. The paper shows how this effort can be minimized by an automatic generation of simulation models.	3.2
Analyzing activities (either static postures or movements) made by a user is a complex process that can be done through a wide range of approaches. One part of these existing approaches support doing the recognition focusing their analysis on specific body parts. In fact, in previous publications a method was introduced for activity recognition (Body-Angles Algorithm) capable of analysing only using a single sample of those activitites and allowing the selection for each activity which are the relevant joints. But being able to analyse the body of the user selecting only a subset of the same, has both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore throughout this article we will expose those disadvantages, the applied solution to mitigate them and the results of an evaluation destined to clear which body parts make it easier to obtain high accuracy rates in recognition. Through this work we aim to give the scientific community lessons learned about the usage of different body areas in the analysis of activity recognition.	4.0
Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is an enabling technology which provides coating and material features with significant advantages compared to other existing techniques for depositing precise nanometer-thin two-dimensional (2D) nanostructures. It is a cyclic process which relies on sequential self-terminating reactions between gas phase precursor molecules and a solid surface. ALD is especially advantageous when the film quality or thickness is critical, offering ultra-high aspect ratios. ALD provides digital thickness control to the atomic level by depositing film one atomic layer at a time, as well as pinhole-free films even over a very large and complex areas. Digital control extends to sandwiches, hetero-structures, nano-laminates, metal oxides, graded index layers and doping, and it is perfect for conformal coating and challenging 2D electrodes for various functional devices. The technique's capabilities are presented on the example of ALD-developed ultra-thin 2D tungsten oxide (W0(3)) over the large area of standard 4 Si substrates. The discussed advantages of ALD enable and endorse the employment of this technique for the development of hetero-nanostructure 2D semiconductors with unique properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

in this paper, the dynamics of the half-bridge LLC resonant converter are investigated based on the small signal model and a piecewise PI regulation is studied and derived by simulation. Small-signal dynamics of the circuit under consideration contain many factors that may affect regulation accuracy and performance of digitally controlled regulators. The load factor is specifically addressed here. The objective of this paper is to introduce a digital piecewise PI compensation to achieve time-optimal response to an external disturbance such as a step load transient.	1.4
Background: It is not known if there is a difference in the immune response to syphilis between HIV-infected and uninfected individuals. Methods: We prospectively recruited all patients with a new diagnosis of syphilis and tested their plasma for IFNa, IFN gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-17A at baseline pre-treatment and 6 months following therapy. Results: A total of 79 HIV-infected [ 44 primary/secondary syphilis (PSS) and 35 latent syphilis (LS)] and 12 HIV-uninfected (10 PSS and 2 LS) cases of syphilis and 30 HIV-infected controls were included in the study. At the baseline visit, compared to the control group, concentrations of IL-10 were significantly elevated in the HIV-infected and uninfected groups. The level of IL-10 was significantly higher in the HIV-infected compared to the HIV-uninfected PSS group (25.3 pg/mL (IQR, 4.56-41.76) vs 2.73 pg/mL (IQR, 1.55-9.02), P = 0.0192). In the HIV-infected PSS group (but not the HIV-infected LS or HIV-uninfected PSS groups) the IP-10, MIP-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 were raised compared to the controls. IL-10 levels decreased but did not return to control baseline values by 6 months in HIV infected PSS and LS and HIV uninfected PSS. Conclusion: PSS and LS in HIV-infected individuals is characterized by an increase in inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. The increase of IL-10 is greater in HIV-infected than uninfected individuals. Further work is required to ascertain if this is part of an immunological profile that correlates with adverse outcomes such as serofast syphilis and neurosyphilis, in HIV-infected individuals.	6.3
The lives of two 19th century cousins, both of whom changed their names to Bernard Berenson, are considered from historical and psychodynamic perspectives, using a psychobiographical method. The Jewish cousins immigrated separately to Boston from Lithuania in 1875 and 1882. One cousin, later calling himself simply B.B., became a world-renowned art historian. The other Bernard became a misanthrope after feeling deeply humiliated by his cousin's family in Boston. Many biographies were written about the famous B.B. The only histories of his cousin Bernard were family stories, as he was the author's great-grandfather. The intersecting lives of these cousins are discussed. Both men faced the challenges of immigration as well as intense antiSemitism and prejudice in each country in which they lived. These cultural and historical conditions interacted with the cousins' narcissistic vulnerabilities. Their lives demonstrate different manifestations of narcissistic suffering, with B.B's being more consistent with the construct of a grandiose narcissist and Bernard's being more consistent with that of a closet narcissist. The life stories of these two cousins with the same name offers an intriguing instance of a complicated relationship among immigration, prejudice, and narcissism and case examples of the manifestation of how narcissistic suffering can influence lives.	2.0
Network security is rapidly developing, but so are attack methods. Network worms are one of the most widely used attack methods and have are able to propagate quickly. As an active defense approach to network worms, the honeynet technique has long been limited by the closed architecture of traditional network devices. In this paper, we propose a closed loop defense system of worms based on a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, called Worm-Hunter. The flexibility of SDN in network building is introduced to structure the network infrastructures of Worm-Hunter. By using well-designed flow tables, Worm-Hunter is able to easily deploy different honeynet systems with different network structures and dynamically. When anomalous traffic is detected by the analyzer in Worm-Hunter, it can be redirected into the honeynet and then safely analyzed. Throughout the process, attackers will not be aware that they are caught, and all of the attack behavior is recorded in the system for further analysis. Finally, we verify the system via experiments. The experiments show that Worm-Hunter is able to build multiple honeynet systems on one physical platform. Meanwhile, all of the honeynet systems with the same topology operate without interference.	0.2
Introduction: Biologic antagonists to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are effective medications and have become well established in the treatment of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Biosimilar medications, which are medications deemed to be equivalent to reference biologic products in terms of clinical effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetic analysis, and immunogenicity, have now been approved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) based on indication exploration from clinical data in alternate disease states. Clinicians use these products with caution secondary to lack of clinical experience. Areas Covered: The authors performed a literature search using the following keywords: CT-P13, biosimilar, adalimumab, infliximab, ABP 501, and inflammatory bowel disease. Bibliographies were also reviewed for pertinent articles. Articles pertaining to the clinical efficacy of biosimilars in IBD were included. Expert commentary: The phase 3 trials, which provided the clinical justification to bring TNF-alpha biosimilars to market, were in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; however, new clinical data suggests that biosimilar products have equivalent safety and efficacy to reference products in IBD. This has led to an increased acceptance amongst practicing gastroenterologists and a potential reduction in healthcare costs.	5.3
The dynamic nature of a river channel entrance is commonly seasonal dependant. This is evidenced in the topography of river channel entrances in East Coast of Borneo which is influenced by both North East (NE) and South West (SW) monsoons on top of surrounding parameters such as waves and tides, sedimentatidn as well as climate change. Advanced numerical modelling technique is frequently used as a leading approach to investigate the complicated nature of river channel entrance to well represent actual conditions of a designated area. This paper presented a mesoscale numerical modelling method by integrating reductionist and reduced complexity model approach along with local seasonal conditions to well represent river channel entrance problem and propose management measures. The model was established with a set of numerical equilibrium equations and calibrated parameters to reflect the features of regional conditions with the combination of local validated modelling parameters. The model had accurately represented the effects of both NE and SW monsoons in terms of hydraulics and sediment dynamics at the Petagas river channel entrance, as verified by site data and satellite imagery. In addition, the accuracy of the model provides confidence in the implementation of improvement measures at the river channel entrance. The improvement scheme includes a training channel and a breakwater in improving flushing capacity, thus preventing sedimentation and upstream flooding, allowing proper navigation through the river. In conclusion, the accurate investigational result from this numerical model had successfully demonstrated its scientific role in solving dynamic river channel entrance, which can serve as a numerical modelling approach for solving similar river channel entrance problems especially in the East Coast of Borneo with predominant inter-annual seasonal variations.

The study aimed to determine if computer vision techniques rooted in deep learning can use a small set of radiographs to perform clinically relevant image classification with high fidelity. One thousand eight hundred eighty-five chest radiographs on 909 patients obtained between January 2013 and July 2015 at our institution were retrieved and anonymized. The source images were manually annotated as frontal or lateral and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets. Training and validation sets were augmented to over 150,000 images using standard image manipulations. We then pre-trained a series of deep convolutional networks based on the open-source GoogLeNet with various transformations of the open-source ImageNet (non-radiology) images. These trained networks were then fine-tuned using the original and augmented radiology images. The model with highest validation accuracy was applied to our institutional test set and a publicly available set. Accuracy was assessed by using the Youden Index to set a binary cutoff for frontal or lateral classification. This retrospective study was IRB approved prior to initiation. A network pre-trained on 1.2 million greyscale ImageNet images and fine-tuned on augmented radiographs was chosen. The binary classification method correctly classified 100 % (95 % CI 99.73-100 %) of both our test set and the publicly available images. Classification was rapid, at 38 images per second. A deep convolutional neural network created using non-radiological images, and an augmented set of radiographs is effective in highly accurate classification of chest radiograph view type and is a feasible, rapid method for high-throughput annotation.	0.0
A genome-wide association study identified GAB2 rs2373115 to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in European population. However, inconsistent results are reported in East Asian population. Here, we performed an updated analysis using 65,704 samples including 20,982 AD cases and 44,722 controls. First, we investigated the GAB2 rs2373115 variant in Asian population using 3974 AD cases and 7568 controls. To further evaluate the effect of rs2373115 in different populations, we selected 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls in European population. We used three genetic models, and found no significant heterogeneity in Asian population. A fixed effect model analysis showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in Asian population. There was no significant heterogeneity in the pooled East Asian and European populations. The fixed effect model analysis again showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in these pooled populations. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAB2 rs2373115 may contribute to AD susceptibility only in European population but not in East Asian population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The reliable detection and attribution of changes in vegetation greenness is a prerequisite for the development of strategies for the sustainable management of ecosystems. We conducted a robust trend analysis on remote sensing derived vegetation index time-series matrices to detect significant changes in inter-annual vegetation productivity (greening versus browning) for the entire Himalaya, a biodiverse and ecologically sensitive yet understudied region. The spatial variability in trend was assessed considering elevation, 12 dominant land cover/use types and 10 ecoregions. To assess trend causation, at local scale, we compared multi-temporal imagery, and at regional scale, referenced ecological theories of mountain vegetation dynamics and ancillary literature. Overall, 17.56% of Himalayan vegetation (71,162 km(2)) exhibited significant trend (p3800 m), with eastern high Himalaya browning more dominantly than western high Himalaya. Land cover/use based categorization confirmed dominant greening of rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas, though cropped areas in western Himalaya contained higher proportion of greening areas. While rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen deposition are the most likely climatic causes of detected greening, success of sustainable forestry practices (community forestry in Nepal) along with increasing agricultural fertilization and irrigation facilities could be possible human drivers. Comparison of multi-temporal imagery enabled direct attribution of some browning areas to anthropogenic land change (dam, airport and tunnel construction). Our satellite detected browning of high altitude vegetation in eastern Himalaya confirm the findings of recent dendrochronology based studies which possibly resulted from reduced pre-monsoon moisture availability in recent decades. These results have significant implications for environmental management in the context of climate change and ecosystem dynamics in the Himalaya. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.2
In 2014, NM-2201 (CBL-2201), a novel synthetic cannabinoid (SC), was detected by scientists at Russian and US laboratories. It has been already added to the list of scheduled drugs in Japan, Sweden and Germany. Unfortunately, no human metabolism data are currently available, which makes it challenging to confirm its intake, especially given that all SCs investigated thus far have been found to be extensively metabolized. The present study aims to recommend appropriate marker metabolites by investigating NM-2201 metabolism in human hepatocytes, and to confirm the results in authentic human urine specimens. For the metabolic stability assay, 1 A mu M NM-2201 was incubated in human liver microsomes (HLMs) for up to 1 h; for metabolite profiling, 10 A mu M of NM-2201 was incubated in human hepatocytes for 3 h. Two authentic urine specimens from NM-2201-positive cases were subjected to beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis prior to analysis. The identification of metabolites in hepatocyte samples and urine specimens was achieved with high-resolution mass spectrometry via information-dependent acquisition. NM-2201 was quickly metabolized in HLMs, with an 8.0-min half-life. In human hepatocyte incubation samples, a total of 13 NM-2201 metabolites were identified, generated mainly from ester hydrolysis and further hydroxylation, oxidative defluorination and subsequent glucuronidation. M13 (5-fluoro PB-22 3-carboxyindole) was found to be the major metabolite. In the urine specimens, the parent drug NM-2201 was not detected; M13 was the predominant metabolite after beta-glucuronidase hydrolysis. Therefore, based on the results of our study, we recommend M13 as a suitable urinary marker metabolite for confirming NM-2201 and/or 5F-PB-22 intake.	6.2

Faces play an integral role in day-to-day functioning, particularly for social interactions where dynamic and rapid processing of information is vital. Analysis of faces allows an individual to ascertain a wide range of information including deciphering mood and identity, with these assessments directing an individual's subsequent response and behaviours. The prominent social and emotional deficits observed in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a youngeronset dementia syndrome, may in part reflect a breakdown of the face processing network. Different subtypes of FTD present with divergent patterns of atrophy, although damage is predominantly confined to the frontal and temporal lobes. Specific predictions regarding the role of frontal and temporal regions in face processing have been proposed in the model outlined by Haxby et al. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4(6), 223-233 (2000). This model presents a parsimonious method by which to understand face processing in FTD while concurrently allowing assessment of the predictive value and applicability of such a model. By applying the Haxby model to the existing FTD literature, this review presents both direct and indirect evidence of a breakdown in key elements of the face processing network. The type and degree of breakdown appears to differ as a function of FTD subtype and associated brain atrophy. The evidence presented in this review and its relationship with predictions of the Haxby model provides impetus and direction for future research investigating face processing in FTD.	2.1
Optimal supply of trace elements (TE) is a prerequisite for microbial growth and activity in anaerobic digestion (AD) bioprocesses. However, the required concentrations and ratios of essential TE for AD biotechnologies strongly depend on prevailing operating conditions as well as feedstock composition. Furthermore, TE in AD bioreactors undergo complex physicochemical reactions and may be present as free ions, complex bound or as precipitates depending on pH, or on the presence of sulfur compounds or organic macromolecules. To overcome TE deficiency, various commercial mineral products are typically applied to AD processes. The addition of heavy metals poses the risk of overdosing operating systems, which may be toxic to microbial consortia and ultimately the environment. Adequate supplementation, therefore, requires appropriate knowledge not only about the composition, but also on the speciation and bioavailability of TE. However, very little is yet fully understood on this specific issue. Evaluations of TE typically only include the measurement of total TE concentrations but do not consider the chemical forms in which TE exist. Thus detailed information on bioavailability and potential toxicity cannot be provided. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in approaches to determine bioavailable TE in anaerobic bioprocesses, including sequential fractionation and speciation techniques. Critical aspects and considerations, including with respect to sampling and analytical procedures, as well as mathematical modeling, are examined. The approaches discussed in this review are based on our experiences and on previously published studies in the context of the COST Action 1302: European Network on Ecological Roles of Trace Metals in Anaerobic Biotechnologies.	0.4
Water pollution is one of the most pervasive problems afflicting people all over the world, while adsorption is the most impactful method to remove the organic pollutants from water. To demonstrate this, a facile and efficient approach is extendable to prepare porous polyurea monolith as a new type of adsorbent for water purification in our research. In order to obtain the porous polyurea monolith, the reaction only between TDI monomer and vapor by using the centrifugally spinning moulding is prepared. Notably, the results show that centrifugally spinning moulding is an effective method to form the whole block structure. According to the specific surface area, pore size and pore size distribution of porous polyurea monolith are affected at different centrifugal speeds. The porous polyurea monolith has continuous interconnected fiber-like clusters skeletal structure, which is composed of mesopores and maropores. Moreover, the porous polyurea monolith could adsorb oils and organic solvents from water fast, which can be attribute to its highly hydrophobic and oleophilic properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated how the evaluation of ethicality that precedes ethical decision making is influenced by personal and situational factors. We argued that both individual and contextual factors would simultaneously influence ethicality evaluation. We found that employees' regulatory focus significantly influenced their evaluation of supervisors' ethical leadership (N = 40 supervisors and 142 employees). We also found that contextual factors interacted with individual factors in the ethicality evaluation process. Results showed that a positive relationship between employees' promotion focus and their evaluation of their supervisor's ethical leadership was negatively moderated by the supervisor's moral attentiveness. Theoretical and practical implications and limitations in the study are discussed.	2.2
At present, China's grain production pattern runs counter to the distribution patterns of farmland resources and water-heat conditions. It is urgently important to conduct research on the spatial matching of grain production and farmland resources. Based on the Potential Crop Rotation data, with regards to the situations of irrigation and rain feeding, this paper builds a measuring model of potential farmland, and separately measures the spatial matching/index of grain yield with actual and potential farmland resources, thus revealing China's grain production pattern. The results indicate that serious spatial mismatch exists between grain production and farmland resources in China. Take the potential crop rotation system into consideration, the spatial mismatch of grain yield and potential farmland resources has been aggravated by the grain production barycenter's shift to the north China, with low Crop Rotation Index. The function-promoting regions of grain production in China are going through two evolution patterns of northward and southward expansion and westward movement and northward expansion, respectively. Inefficient use of farmland mainly occurs in the fragile ecological environments, such as the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China, the northwest area of Xinjiang and the southwest karst landform areas. The inefficient use of and the decreasing amount of available farmland have become the main causes of the decline in grain production. The problems facing Chinese agriculture caused by the spatial mismatch include the imbalance in regional structures, ecological risks, agricultural production risks, and the risk of food price. In order to cope with these problems, this paper provides some advices on protecting farmland acreage, expanding farmland potential, ensuring the safety of water resources, and extending the industrial grain chain. Our paper additionally proposes policy reforms and innovations designed to ensure the implementation of the above measures, so as to commonly defuse China's food security crisis.

In this study the corrosion resistances of AISI 1018 and AISI 304 borided and non-borided steels were estimated using polarization resistance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Boriding of the steel samples was conducted using the powder-pack method at 1223 K with 6 h of exposure. Structural examinations of the surfaces of the borided steels showed the presence of a Fe2B layer with isolated FeB teeth on the AISI 1018 steel, whereas a compact layer of FeB/Fe2B was formed on the AISI 304 steel. Polarization resistance and EIS of the borided and non-borided steels surfaces were performed in a corrosive solution of 1 M HCl. The EIS data were analyzed during 43 days of exposure to the acid solution. Impedance curves obtained during this period for the borided and non-borided steels were modeled using equivalent electrical circuits. The results of both electrochemical techniques indicated that boride layers formed at the steel surfaces effectively protect the samples from the corrosive effects of HCl. The main corrosion processes observed on the boride layers were pitting and crevice corrosion.	1.2
A number of recent studies have begun to explore a new and exciting area: the interaction between the gut microbiome and renal physiology. In particular, multiple studies have focused on the role of microbially produced short chain fatty acids, which are generally thought to promote health. This review will focus on what is known to date regarding the influence of the microbiome on renal function, with emphasis on the cell biology, physiology, and clinical implications of short chain fatty acids and short chain fatty acid receptors. It is clear that microbe-host interactions are an exciting and ever-expanding field, which has implications for how we view diseases such as hypertension, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease. However, it is important to recognize that although the potential promise of this area is extremely enticing, we are only the very edge of this new field.	6.1
The UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (UNCRPD) [1] puts a focus on accessibility and technology. Both are considered as a precondition and means to support full participation of people. Today, new technologies provide new options for the support of all people including people with disabilities. The concepts assistive technology and accessibility begin to merge into Technology Based Accessibility (TBA). TBA has the potential to make a significant change in the lives of people with disabilities.	4.0
Inferring the intentions and beliefs of another is an ability that is fundamental for social and affiliative interactions. A substantial amount of empirical evidence suggests that making sense of another's intentional and belief states (i.e. theory of mind) relies on exteroceptive (e.g. visual and auditory) and proprioceptive (i.e. motor) signals. Yet, despite its pivotal role in the guidance of behaviour, the role of the observer's interoceptive (visceral) processing in understanding another's internal states remains unexplored. Predicting and keeping track of interoceptive bodily states - which inform intentions and beliefs that guide behaviour - is one of the fundamental purposes of the human brain. In this paper, we will focus on the role of interoceptive predictions, prescribed by the free energy principle, in making sense of internal states that cause another's behaviour. We will discuss how multimodal expectations induced at deep (high) hierarchical levels - that necessarily entail interoceptive predictions - contribute to inference about others that is at the heart of theory of mind.

Linear circuits and systems are generally described by traditional differential equations and integer order transfer functions based on the assumption that the dynamics are lumped and time invariant. However, as compared to the conventional integer order calculus, many dynamical systems are better represented by fractional calculus with interaction among the variables modelled by fractional integration and/or fractional differentiation. The present work proposes a generalized approach for the identification of fractional order systems in frequency domain using experimental data. To achieve the same, the system identification task has been framed as an optimization problem and solved using seeker optimization algorithm. The algorithm seeks to attain a set of system parameters for which the deviation between the simulated response of the identified system and experimental data is minimized. The proposed approach has been validated on a set of electrical circuits with varying configuration. The simulation and experimental results reveals that all of the test circuits are better represented by fractional order model, over a wide range of frequency.	1.2
Referring to two recent publications, we here propose that clinical reproductive immunology has for decades stagnated because reproductive medicine, including assisted reproduction (AR), has failed to accept embryo implantation as an immune system-driven process, dependent on establishment of maternal tolerance toward the implanting fetal semi-allograft (and complete allograft in cases of oocyte donation). Pregnancy represents a biologically unique period of temporary (to the period of gestation restricted) tolerance, otherwise only known in association with parasitic infections. Rather than investigating the immune pathways necessary to induce this rather unique state of tolerance toward the rapidly growing parasitic antigen load of the fetus, the field, instead, concentrated on irrelevant secondary immune phenomena (i.e., immunological noise). It, therefore, does not surprise that interesting recent research, offering new potential insights into maternal tolerance during pregnancy, was mostly published outside of the field of reproductive medicine. This research offers evidence for existence of inducible maternal tolerance pathways with the ability of improving maternal fecundity and, potentially, reducing such late pregnancy complications as premature labor and preeclampsia/eclampsia due to premature abatement of maternal tolerance. Increasing evidence also suggests that tolerance-inducing immune pathways are similar in successful pregnancy, successful organ transplantation and, likely also in the tolerance of self (i.e., prevention of autoimmunity). Identifying and isolating these pathways, therefore, may greatly benefit all three of these clinical areas, and research in reproductive immunology should be accordingly redirected.	6.3
Hallucinogenic tryptamine analogues, an important class of drugs of abuse, can be naturally occurring or chemically synthesized compounds. In Japan, psilocin and psilocybin (ingredients of magic mushrooms) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT; a synthetic tryptamine) seem to be particularly problematic due to their extensive abuse. This review is focused on human metabolism and forensic toxicological analyses of the above three tryptamine analogues. In humans, psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated to form psilocin, and most of the psilocin is eventually conjugated to form its glucuronide. On the other hand, 5-MeO-DIPT is mainly metabolized via O-demethylation, 6-hydroxylation, and N-deisopropylation, partly followed by conjugation to form their sulfates and glucuronides. Suitable hydrolysis should be, therefore, applied for sensitive and effective analysis of the metabolites. In analyzing psilocin and psilocybin by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), derivatization is necessary for their discriminative identification. Although 5-MeO-DIPT and its three major metabolites can be analyzed by GC-MS without any derivatization, trimethylsilyl derivatization provides improvement of their peak shapes and intensities. In contrast to GC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allow us not only to discriminate psilocin and psilocybin without derivatization, but also to directly analyze their conjugated metabolites.	6.2
Facial hair, like many masculine secondary sexual traits, plays a significant role in perceptions of an array of sociosexual traits in men. While there is consensus that beards enhance perceptions of masculinity, age, social dominance, and aggressiveness, the perceived attractiveness of facial hair varies greatly across women. Given the ease with which facial hair can be groomed and removed entirely, why should some men retain beards and others choose to remove them? We hypothesized that men with relatively sexist attitudes would be more likely to allow their facial hair to grow than men with less sexist attitudes. Men from the USA (n = 223) and India (n = 309) completed an online survey measuring demographic variables, ambivalent sexism, and facial hair status. After controlling for demographic variables, men with facial hair were significantly higher in hostile sexism than clean-shaven men; hostile sexism was a significant predictor of facial hair status over and above demographic variables; and facial hair was more frequent among ambivalent and hostile sexists than among benevolent and non-sexists. It is suggested that sexist men choose to grow facial hair because it maximizes sexual dimorphism and augments perceived masculinity and dominance.	2.2
Several factors related to the immune system, such as a history of allergies and virus infections, may be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The purpose of this study was to analyze whether the presence of atopic diseases and previous infection with parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with the development of ALL. This case-control study was performed in two tertiary hospitals located in northeastern Brazil. The study population included 60 patients who were diagnosed with non-T-cell ALL using myelogram and immunophenotyping and 120 patients in the control group. Atopy was evaluated via a parent questionnaire and medical records. Total immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG levels of parvovirus B19 and EBV were measured in the serum. Logistic regression was performed to assess the association between variables and odds of ALL. We identified a significant inverse association between rhinitis, urticaria and elevated IgE serum levels with ALL. A history of parvovirus B19 infection showed a significant association with this type of cancer [OR (95 % CI) 2.00 (1.94-4.26); P = 0.050]. In logistic regression, the presence of atopy was a protective factor [OR (95 % CI) 0.57 (0.38-0.83); P = 0.004], and the presence of IgG for parvovirus B19 was an important risk factor for ALL [OR (95 % CI) 2.20 (1.02-4.76); P = 0.043]. These results suggest that atopic diseases and elevated total IgE levels are associated with a potential protective effect on the development of ALL. Previous infection with parvovirus B19 contributed to ALL susceptibility.	5.1
This paper proposes a bidirectional three-level LLC resonant converter with a new pulse width and amplitude modulation control method. With different control signals, it has three different operation modes with different voltage gains. Therefore, it can achieve wide voltage gain range by switching among these three modes, which is attractive for energy storage system applications needing wide voltage variation. The proposed topology operates with constant switching frequency, which is easy to implement with digital control, and it can achieve soft switching for all the switches and diodes in the circuit as a conventional LLC resonant converter. The performance of the proposed converter is validated by the experimental results from a 1-kW prototype with 20 A maximum output current.	1.4
A rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was applied to human urine samples to discover new molecular biomarkers of the alteration of psychophysical well-being due to the environmental, physiological and confinement stress conditions achieved in the MARS500 project. Urine samples of crew members were submitted to metabolomic studies by means of separative techniques coupled with mass spectrometric techniques and data analysis. More than 2,000 metabolite features were found in each comparison, and more than 150 metabolites were identified for every differential analysis. Significant modifications in eight metabolites were shared by the subjects under study.	6.2
Semantic dementia (SD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), subtypes of frontotemporal dementia, are characterized by distinct clinical symptoms and neuroimaging features, with predominant left temporal grey matter (GM) atrophy in SD and bilateral or right frontal GM atrophy in bvFTD. Such differential hemispheric predilection may also be reflected by other neuroimaging features, such as brain connectivity. This study investigated white matter (WM) microstructure and functional connectivity differences between SD and bvFTD, focusing on the hemispheric predilection of these differences. Eight SD and 12 bvFTD patients, and 17 controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional MRI at 3T. Whole-brain WM microstructure was assessed to determine distinct WM tracts affected in SD and bvFTD. For these tracts, diffusivity measures and lateralization indices were calculated. Functional connectivity was established for GM regions affected in early stage SD or bvFTD. Results of a direct comparison between SD and bvFTD are reported. Whole-brain WM microstructure abnormalities were more pronounced in the left hemisphere in SD and bilaterally-with a slight predilection for the right-in bvFTD. Lateralization of tract-specific abnormalities was seen in SD only, toward the left hemisphere. Functional connectivity of disease-specific regions was mainly decreased bilaterally in SD and in the right hemisphere in bvFTD. SD and bvFTD show WM microstructure and functional connectivity abnormalities in different regions, that are respectively more pronounced in the left hemisphere in SD and in the right hemisphere in bvFTD. This indicates differential hemispheric predilection of brain connectivity abnormalities between SD and bvFTD.	2.1
Human genetic studies are continuing to increase in size and scale, but the availability of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts remains rare. Significant infrastructure, investment and effort are required to establish and maintain high-quality cohorts with biobanking, genetic consent and repeated clinical data measurements. Australia currently has two such cohorts established by Monash University as part of community-based clinical trials in the elderly. Both studies involve capture of demographic, mood, cognitive performance, physical function, neuroimaging, audiometry and various clinical data types over an average of 5years. The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) cohort is comprised of 16703 Australians aged over 70years and 2411 Americans aged over 65years - recruited and randomised to either daily low-dose aspirin or placebo to examine the preventative benefit of aspirin on a range of clinical outcomes. The STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) study uses a similar model, and is currently recruiting 10000 men and women aged over 70years across Australia randomised to either low-dose statins or placebo. Both cohorts involve biobanking and consent for genetic research, with recruitment through a network of general practitioners in the community. A combination of whole-genome and targeted sequencing approaches will allow gene-phenotype relationships to be explored within the context of detailed longitudinal data. Genetic risk factors for late-onset high-burden conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia will be investigated, plus research into other areas, such as healthy ageing and disease resilience will be possible due to unique phenotypes of health.	6.4
Medical biochemistry is the usual name for clinical biochemistry or clinical chemistry in Serbia, and medical biochemist is the official name for the clinical chemist (or clinical biochemist). This is the largest sub-discipline of the laboratory medicine in Serbia. It includes all aspects of clinical chemistry, and also laboratory hematology with coagulation, immunology, etc. Medical biochemistry laboratories in Serbia and medical biochemists as a profession are part of Health Care System and their activities are regulated through: the Health Care Law and rules issued by the Chamber of Medical Biochemists of Serbia. The first continuous and organized education for Medical Biochemists (Clinical Chemists) in Serbia dates from 1945, when the Department of Medical Biochemistry was established at the Pharmaceutical Faculty in Belgrade. In 1987 at the same Faculty a five years undergraduate study program was established, educating Medical Biochemists under a special program. Since the academic year 2006/2007 the new five year undergraduate (according to Bologna Declaration) and four-year postgraduate program according to EC4 European Syllabus for Postgraduate Training in Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine has been established. The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Public Health accredited these programs. There are four requirements for practicing medical biochemistry in the Health Care System: University Diploma of the Faculty of Pharmacy (Study of Medical Biochemistry), successful completion of the professional exam at the Ministry of Health after completion of one additional year of obligatory practical training in the medical biochemistry laboratories, membership in the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists and licence for skilled work issued by the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists. In order to present laboratory medical biochemistry practice in Serbia this paper will be focused on the following: Serbian national legislation, healthcare services organization, sub-disciplines of laboratory medicine and medical biochemistry as the most significant, education in medical biochemistry, conditions for professional practice in medical biochemistry, continuous quality improvement, and accreditation. Serbian healthcare is based on fundamental principles of universal health coverage and solidarity between all citizens.	6.3
It is well known that the existence of unstable zero dynamics is recognized as a major barrier in many control systems. When the usual digital control with zero-order hold (ZOH) or fractional-order hold (FROH) input is used, unstable zero dynamics inevitably appear in the discrete-time model even though the continuous-time system with relative degree more than two is of minimum phase. This paper investigates the zero dynamics, as the sampling period tends to zero, of sampled-data models composed of a generalized sample hold function (GSHF), a continuous-time nonlinear plant and a sampler in cascade. More precisely, we show how an approximate sampled-data model can be obtained for nonlinear systems with two special GSHF cases such that sampled zero dynamics of the resulting model can be arbitrarily placed. Further, two GSHFs with appropriate parameters provide nonlinear zero dynamics as stable as possible, or with improved stability properties even when unstable, for a given continuous-time plant. It is also shown that the intersample behavior arising from the multirate input can be localised by appropriately selecting the design parameters based on the stability condition of the zero dynamics. The results presented here generalize well-known ideas from the linear to nonlinear cases.	1.4
Unexpected, informal recognition is common in the workplace, but rarely analyzed by academics. The few existing studies have generated surprising results: no impact of selective recognition on future productivity for those workers who receive recognition, but increases in productivity for those who do not. We confirm those results for recognition in the form of a Thank you message and show that the same patterns hold true with unexpected financial recognition. Low-performing workers do better when others are recognized but they are left out. Previous studies have all argued that the pure relative performance information that is revealed through recognition drives these effects. We test this hypothesis with a treatment that has relative rank information only and show that this is indeed the case: financial or verbal recognition are not necessary to induce low performers to increase subsequent performance.

Phase-shift modulation (PSM) is a commonly used technique for controlling the active power flow in resonant dc-ac and dc-dc converters. Although traditionally developed as an analog modulation scheme, PSM is being increasingly implemented digitally in conjunction with advanced multivariable digital controllers and online efficiency optimization algorithms. While analog PSM is known not to introduce additional dynamics from a small-signal standpoint, the analysis disclosed in this study indicates that discrete-time, or uniformly sampled, PSM introduces a transport delay of small-signal nature. Furthermore, and in close analogy with the theory of uniformly sampled pulse width modulators, such delay depends on the modulator carrier type as well as on the converter operating point. This paper first clarifies the modeling procedure for describing the small-signal dynamics of uniformly sampled phase-shift modulators. Second, it provides an extension of the traditional phasor modeling to digital phase-controlled converters, allowing to account for the additional modulator dynamics in the design of the closed-loop compensation. Theoretical findings are validated via simulation and experimental results.	1.4
In an urban highway network system such as Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. to detect conditions of road pavement and expansion Joints is a very important issue. Although accurate surface condition can be captured by using a road profiler system, the operating cost is expensive and development of a simpler and more inexpensive system is really needed to reduce monitoring cost. Vehicle Intelligent Monitoring System (VIMS) developed for this purpose is described in this paper. An accelerometer and GPS are installed to an ordinary road patrol car. GPS together with a PC computer are used to measure the road surface condition and to identify the location of the vehicle, respectively Dynamic response of the vehicle is used as a measure of the road pavements surface condition as well as the expansion joints. A prototype of VIMS is installed to a motor car and measurement is made at the actual roads. Accuracy of measuring result and effectiveness of this system are demonstrated; the outline of the system and some of the measurement results are reported herein.	4.1
Computer-aided design (CAD) models of thin-walled solids such as sheet metal or plastic parts are often reduced dimensionally to their corresponding midsurfaces for quicker and fairly accurate results of computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis. Computation of the midsurface is still a time-consuming and mostly, a manual task due to lack of robust and automated techniques. Most of the existing techniques work on the final shape (typically in the form of boundary representation, B-rep). Complex B-reps make it hard to detect subshapes for which the midsurface patches are computed and joined, forcing usage of hard-coded heuristic rules, developed on a case-by-case basis. Midsurface failures manifest in the form of gaps, overlaps, nonmimicking input model, etc., which can take hours or even days to correct. The research presented here proposes to address these problems by leveraging feature-information available in the modern CAD models, and by effectively using techniques like simplification, abstraction, and decomposition. In the proposed approach, first, the irrelevant features are identified and removed from the input FbCAD model to compute its simplified gross shape. Remaining features then undergo abstraction to transform into their corresponding generic Loft-equivalents, each having a profile and a guide curve. The model is then decomposed into cellular bodies and a graph is populated, with cellular bodies at the nodes and fully overlappingsurface- interfaces at the edges. The nodes are classified into midsurface-patch generating nodes (called solid cellsor sCells) and interaction-resolving nodes (interface cells or iCells). In a sCell, a midsurface patch is generated either by offset or by sweeping the midcurve of the owner-Loft-feature's profile along with its guide curve. Midsurface patches are then connected in the iCells in a generic manner, thus resulting in a wellconnected midsurface with minimum failures. Output midsurface is then validated topologically for correctness. At the end of this paper, real-life parts are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.	3.0
The spin-change dynamics of a model with ultra-cold hyperfine-spin-1 atoms confined in an optical superlattice is discussed. First, the disturbance of the two-site dynamics by coupling the dimer to a spin-1 ancilla is analyzed. When the dimer is coupled to the ancilla, even by a weak coupling, the significant changes in the system's time-evolution processes are observed. Next, we show that for the twoparticle case the total hyperfine-spin-singlet state is generated by exploiting a quadratic Zeeman shift with realistic values of the strength of external magnetic field and evolution period of time. Moreover, even in a weak coupling regime, the proper choice of the additional ancilla-dimer interaction results in generating the wave function which is characteristic of the homogeneous three-site ring. In consequence, such wave function exhibits translational invariance symmetry despite the strong asymmetry of the lattice. Furthermore, we present our proposal for extracting various kinds of maximally entangled states (MES) for three-site spin-1 systems, starting from initial product states. In particular, we show that the type of generated MES can be unambiguously recognized by the measurement performed on the ancilla.	0.3
Background and Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the internal and marginal fit of chrome cobalt (Co-Cr) crowns were fabricated with laser sintering, computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing, and conventional methods. Materials and Methods: Polyamide master and working models were designed and fabricated. The models were initially designed with a software application for three-dimensional (3D) CAD (Maya, Autodesk Inc.). All models were fabricated models were produced by a 3D printer (EOSINT P380 SLS, EOS). 128 1-unit Co-Cr fixed dental prostheses were fabricated with four different techniques: Conventional lost wax method, milled wax with lost-wax method (MWLW), direct laser metal sintering (DLMS), and milled Co-Cr (MCo-Cr). The cement film thickness of the marginal and internal gaps was measured by an observer using a stereomicroscope after taking digital photos in x24. Results: Best fit rates according to mean and standard deviations of all measurements was in DLMS both in premolar (65.84) and molar (58.38) models in mm. A significant difference was found DLMS and the rest of fabrication techniques (P 0.05). No significant difference was found between MCo-CR and MWLW in all fabrication techniques both in premolar and molar models (P 0.05). Conclusion: DMLS was best fitting fabrication techniques for single crown based on the results.The best fit was found in marginal; the larger gap was found in occlusal.All groups were within the clinically acceptable misfit range.	3.0
This study deals with the motion and deformation of a compound drop system, subject to arbitrary but Stokes far-field flow conditions, in the presence of hulk-insoluble surfactants. We derive solutions for fluid velocities and the resulting surfactant concentrations, assuming the capillary number and surface Peclet number to he small, as compared with unity. We first focus on a concentric drop configuration and apply Lamb's general solution, assuming the far-field flow to he arbitrary in nature. As representative case studies, we consider two cases: (i) flow dynamics in linear flows and (ii) flow dynamics in a Poiseuille flow, although for the latter case, the concentric configuration does not remain valid in general. We further look into the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of compound drops, subject to linear ambient flow, and compare our predictions with previously reported experiments. Subsequently, the eccentric drop configuration is addressed by using a bipolar coordinate system where the far-field flow is assumed to he axisymmetric but otherwise arbitrary in nature. As a specific example for eccentric drop dynamics, we focus on Poiseuille flow and study the drop migration velocities. Our analysis shows that the presence of surfactant generally opposes the imposed flows, thereby acting like an effective augmented viscosity. Our analysis reveals that maximizing the effects of surfactant makes the drops behave like solid particles suspended in a medium. However, in uniaxial extensional flow, the presence of surfactants on the inner drop, in conjunction with the drop radius ratio, leads to a host of interesting and non-monotonic behaviours for the interface deformation. For eccentric drops, the effect of eccentricity only becomes noticeable after it surpasses a certain critical value, and becomes most prominent when the two interfaces approach each other. We further depict that surfactant and eccentricity generally tend to suppress each other's effects on the droplet migration velocities.	3.4
Introduction: C1q play an important role in clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cell debris. Impaired clearance leads to exposure of C1 native antigen and development of anti-C1q antibody formation. Anti-C1q antibody is well studied in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Significance of anti-C1q Ab in Indian SLE patients and their clinical manifestations is not clear. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between anti-C1q antibody and clinical as well as serological markers of SLE. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study of SLE patients fulfilling either American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 2012 classification criteria were recruited from inpatients and outpatients services of the Clinical immunology and Rheumatology Department, Christian Medical College at Vellore, India between March 2013 and January 2015. Anti-C1q antibody was assayed by ELISA (Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the association of anti-C1q antibodies with serological and clinical parameters in SLE including Lupus Nephritis (LN). Results: Sixty nine patients (54.76%) out of 126 SLE patients had LN. Anti-C1q levels were higher in patients with LN as compared to those without (p<0.05). Anti-C1q antibody was also significantly associated with positive C1q immunofluorescence staining in renal biopsy specimens (p<0.05). Overall, renal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) {OR 1.35 (1.08-1.69)}, low C4 {OR 3.11 (1.04-9.26)} and mucocutaneous manifestation {OR 4.72 (1.38-16.05)} were independently associated with anti-C1q levels in serum. Conclusion: Renal SLEDAI, low C4 and mucocutaneous manifestations were independently associated with raised anti C1q antibody in SLE patients.	6.3
Vision declines during normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the toxic role of amyloid beta (Ab) has been established in AD pathogenesis, its influence on the aging retina is unclear. Using APP(swe)/PS1 Delta E9 transgenic (TG) mice, a classical AD model, the retinal cell function and survival was assessed by electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and immunofluorescent stainings. Strikingly, photopic ERG measurements revealed that the retinal response mediated by cones was preserved in aging TG mice relative to WT controls. In contrast to the cortex, the expression of mutated APP(swe) and PS1 Delta E9 did not allow to detect Ab or amyloid plaques in 13-month-old male TG retinae. In addition, the CTF beta/CTF alpha ratio was significantly lower in retinal samples than that in cortical extracts, suggesting that the non-amyloidogenic pathway may endogenously limit Ab formation in the retina of male mice. Collectively, our data suggest that retinal-specific processing of amyloid may confer protection against AD and selectively preserve cone-dependent vision during aging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Large-scale open storage of wood mulch is common practice at wood recycling facilities. During rain and snow melt, leachate with soluble compounds and suspended particles is released from mulch stockpiles. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of leachate/runoff from wood recycling facilities to evaluate its potential to contaminate receiving waterbodies. Wood mulch (n = 30) and leachate/runoff (n = 26) samples were collected over 1.5 years from three wood recycling facilities in New Jersey, USA. Differences by site were found (p < 0.05) for most of the 21 constituents tested in the solid wood mulch samples. Biochemical oxygen demand (range <20-3000 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (134-6000 mg/L) and total suspended solids (69-401 mg/L) median concentrations of the leachate/runoff samples were comparable to those of untreated domestic wastewater. Total Kjeldahl N, total P and fecal coliform median values were slightly lower than typical wastewater values. Dose-response studies with leachate/runoff samples using zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos showed that mortality and developmental defects typically did not occur even at the highest concentration tested, indicating low toxicity, although delayed development did occur. Based on this study, leachate/runoff from wood recycling facilities should not be released to surface waters as it is a potential source of organic contamination and low levels of nutrients. A study in which runoff from a controlled drainage area containing wood mulch of known properties is monitored would allow for better assessment of the potential impact of stormwater runoff from wood recycling facilities.

Forkhead box O (FOXO)1, FOXO3, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)4, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (xIAP), and E74-like factor (ELF)4 have been described as important regulators of T cell functions and differentiation. However, whether these molecules are associated with HIV-1 disease progression is still unknown. In this study, we showed that the levels of FOXO3, IRF4, and xIAP mRNA in rapid progressors (RPs) were significantly higher than in HIV-negative healthy controls (HCs). Moreover, FOXO3 expression was positively correlated with HIV-1 viral load and CD4(+) T cell activation. Remarkably, increased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell activation was apparent in RPs compared with typical progressors and HCs. In addition, a profile of higher apoptosis, more CD8(+) T-EM cells, and fewer CD4(+) and CD8(+) Naive T cells were observed in early HIV infection patients with low CD4(+) T cell counts. Furthermore, in vitro, IRF4 and xIAP expression was enhanced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy people following T cell receptor stimulation. T cell activation was decreased by treatment with siRNA inhibiting FOXO3, IRF4, and xIAP. Our results show that significantly increased levels of FOXO3, IRF4, and xIAP mRNA in Chinese HIV-1-infected patients were related to T cell immune activation, implicating them as potential targets for developing new therapeutic avenues to slow down HIV-1 disease progression.	6.0
In the present project it has been possible to prove the relationship existing between internal personality variables such as self-concept or pro-sociality and distal variables like physical activity and academic achievement, within the school context. Promoting physical activity both as a sport and also a means for teenagers to learn personal and social competence allows us to offer an educational tool to develop pro-social behavior. This is a descriptive project, whose sample is made up of 115 secondary school students. A socio-demographic questionnaire has been used, the self-concept questionnaire (AF-5), the scale of pro-sociality in teenagers and adults, the Cantoblanco scale of socialization difficulties (SOC) and different school qualifications. Among the results obtained, it is confirmed that by doing physical activity ones physical self-concept improves and this, in turn, leads to better social perception thus integrating the teenager into peer groups and resulting in better academic results.	2.4
New classes of descriptor fractional continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems with regular pencils are introduced. Electrical circuits are an example of descriptor fractional continuous-time systems. Using the Caputo definition of the fractional derivative, the Weierstrass regular pencil decomposition and Laplace transformation the solution to the state equation of descriptor fractional linear systems is derived. It is shown that every electrical circuit is a descriptor fractional systems if it contains at least one mesh consisting of branches with only ideal supercondensators and voltage sources, or at least one node with branches containing supercoils. Using the Weierstrass regular pencil decomposition the solution to the state equation of descriptor fractional discrete-time linear systems is derived.

A new sensor placement problem is formulated to cover two objectives of: (1) assuring quality of water delivered to consumers; and (2) detection of any contamination event at the earliest so as to minimize its consequences, through maximization of: (1) demand coverage; and (2) time-constrained detection likelihood for pressure deficient networks. The network may become pressure-deficient owing to continued use of water distribution network beyond its design life. The two objectives are combined using weights. Genetic algorithm is used to obtain optimum sensor locations. The methodology is applied to a pressure-deficient network in the Dharampeth zone of Nagpur city (India). The pressure-dependent analysis is carried out using WaterGem v8i to simulate the system hydraulics. Performance objectives are evaluated considering the availability of flows at nodes and velocity of flow in pipes under pressure-deficient conditions. Comparison of optimal sensor network design is carried out with that obtained by demand-dependent analysis.	3.1
Soil water evaporation from the cropping surface is a wasteful loss of potentially productive rainwater, thus efficient use of rainwater can help to sustain dryland production. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of canopy shading (CS) and mulch levels (ML) on soil water evaporation (Es) from each 1 m section of in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) and to evaluate the Ritchie (alpha') and Stroosnijder (beta') soil evaporation models on the effect of surface treatments. A microlysimetric method was used to measure Es from beneath maize (Zea mays L.) canopy for three consecutive drying cycles across the basin and runoff sections of IRWH on fine sandy loam soil of Bainsvlei Kenilworth ecotope. First, main effects of four runoff strip lengths (RSL) and three ML treatments were statistically analysed on the weighted Es values. Second, the ML treatments were allocated to the main plots and four levels of CS allocated according to lengths of the runoff sections. Third, cumulative Es (Sigma Es) measurements were used to evaluate empirical equations related to time (alpha') and potential evaporation (beta'). The two models for Es were compared by considering the effects of surface treatments. A significantly higher Es was observed from a bare (ML0%) treatment compared with either of two mulched treatments viz, mulch level 39% and 96% cover (ML39% and ML96%); no significant differences were found between the mulched treatments. The insignificant effect of RSL treatments on Es implied the dynamics of spatial distribution of soil water and energy that influenced evaporation were as a result of green mulch or shading cover (CS) on Es beneath the canopy. Less suppressive Es properties were developed from bare surface and efficient Es restriction was found under high mulch and shading cover treatments. The alpha' and beta' values ranged from 2.34 to 4.26 mm d(-0.5) and from 1.38 to 2.06 mm d(-0.5), respectively. In all the treatments the simulated Sigma Es was underestimated by the Ritchie model and overestimated by the Stroosnijder model. The main effect of shading was due to the dominant effect of energy limited evaporation (stage-1), while the mulched treatments were mainly driven by soil limited stage (stage-2) of evaporation. The Ritchie model performed well to estimate Sigma Es from the basin area and the potential Stroosnijder model from the unshaded runoff strips. The microclimate of the cropping system changed according to surface treatments that highly influenced the Es losses in IRWH of dryland production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4.3
Since substitution box (S-box) is the only nonlinear component related to confusion properties for many block encryption algorithms, it is a necessity for the strong block encryption algorithms. S-box is a vital component in cryptography due to having the effect on the security of entire system. Therefore, alternative S-box construction techniques have been proposed in many researches. In this study, a new S-box construction method based on fractional-order (FO) chaotic Chen system is presented. In order to achieve that goal, numerical results of the FO chaotic Chen system for a = 35, b = 3, c = 28 and alpha = 0.9 are obtained by employing the predictor-corrector scheme. Besides, a simpler algorithm is suggested for the construction of S-box via time response of the FO chaotic Chen system. The performance of suggested S-box design is compared with other S-box designs developed by chaotic systems, and it is observed that this method provides a stronger S-box design.	0.3
Background: Alcohol ingestion influences sensory-motor function and the overall well-being of individuals. Detecting alcohol induced impairments in gait in daily life necessitates a continuous and unobtrusive gait monitoring system. Objectives: This paper introduces the development and use of a non-intrusive monitoring system to detect changes in gait induced by alcohol intoxication. Methods: The proposed system employed a pair of sensorized smart shoes that are equipped with pressure sensors on the insole. Gait features were extracted and adjusted based on individual's gait profile. The adjusted gait features were used to train a machine learning classifier to discriminate alcohol-impaired gait from normal walking. In experiment of pilot study, twenty participants completed walking trials on a 12 meter walkway to measure their sober walking and alcohol-impaired walking using smart shoes. Results: The proposed system can detect alcohol-impaired gait with an accuracy of 86.2% when pressure value analysis and person-dependent model for the classifier are applied, while statistical analysis revealed that no single feature was discriminative for the detection of gait impairment. Conclusions: Alcohol-induced gait disturbances can be detected with smart shoe technology for an automated monitoring in ubiquitous environment. We demonstrated that personal monitoring and machine learning-based prediction could be customized to detect individual variation rather than applying uniform boundary parameters of gait.	4.0
The effectiveness of layered-geotextile protection layers comprised of combinations of nonwoven needle-punched, woven slit-film, and nonwoven heat-bonded geotextiles to minimize strains in landfill geomembranes is examined. Results from physical experiments are reported where a sustained 700-N force was applied to a 28-mm-diameter machined steel probe on top of the protection layer, which was above a 60-mm-diameter, 1.5-mm-thick high-density polyethylene geomembrane and a 50-mm-thick compressible clay layer. The experiments are intended to simulate the physical conditions in a medium-sized landfill with an average vertical stress of 250 kPa and to capture the mean response with nominal 50-mm coarse gravel above the geomembrane. Screening tests were first conducted for up to 100 h at temperatures up to 55 degrees C to evaluate three different combinations of layered geotextiles. Of those examined, the combination with a low-slack, heat-bonded geotextile above and below a thick, nonwoven, needle-punched geotextile as its central core was found to provide the lowest strains. A time-temperature superposition method was then developed and validated as a means to predict the long-term effectiveness of the most promising layered-geotextile composite. Last, long-term predictions of tensile strain were made and compared with proposed allowable limits. Despite the encouraging results from the short-term screening tests, even the most promising layered-geotextile composite is not recommended as a protection layer to limit long-term geomembrane strains for the particular force, particle size, and materials examined because the predicted strain after 100 years at 22-55 degrees C of similar to 10% exceeds the range of currently proposed limits of 3-8%.

Background: The intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid (A beta) in mice allows the investigation of acute effects on cognitive function and cellular pathology. The aim of this investigation was to further characterize the time course of A beta-induced cognitive and behavioural changes and to detect potential molecular mechanisms. Methods: Cannulas were implanted in the lateral cerebral ventricle. 14 days after surgery the mice were injected with A beta 1-42 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Starting 2, 4 or 8 (PBS only 4) days after injection we evaluated cognitive and behavioural performance using the modified hole board test (mHBT). We determined tumour-necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and caspase 3 by western blotting, on days 10, 12 and 16. Data were analysed using general linear modelling, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney-U test. Results: A beta induced a decline in cognitive performance represented as an increased total number of wrong choices during the testing period from day 2-15 (p < 0.05). Behavioural parameters were comparable between mice treated with A beta and PBS. There was no difference regarding TNF alpha levels between the groups. Compared to day 16 Caspase 3 levels were increased on day 10 (p = 0.004). Conclusions: Application of A beta in the lateral ventricle of mice is associated with cognitive impairment of declarative memory in the mHBT. There is no interference caused by altered behaviour. Therefore, it represents a valid model for acute A beta-mediated neurotoxic effects. Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, changes in levels of Caspase 3 suggest apoptosis as an important factor for the development of cognitive dysfunction.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Rule-based people strive to conform to a moral norm. Outcome-based people, on the other hand, adjust their behavior to the concrete consequences of their acts. We argue that the categorization of the mind-set may also be informative when it comes to explaining the effects that good and bad moral examples have on the moral behavior of the observer. To test this, we play a dictator game after dictators observed prosocial and antisocial third-party actions in a different domain. The consequences of these actions affected dictator and receiver identically. We hypothesized that this makes it unnecessary for an outcome-minded dictator to intervene correctively, while it influences a rule-minded dictator to follow the example by aligning her behavior. In line with our hypothesis, we find that only rule-minded dictators reacted to the example set by others. They are, however, asymmetrically incited by moral transgressions, while being left uninspired by praiseworthy examples. Our findings call for some precaution when applying policy measures based on informing people about prosocial and antisocial behavior, especially in cultures in which the moral focus is on rules.

Building physical computing projects can enable learners to integrate computing into a range of interests and disciplines. However, the electronic portion of these projects can be difficult. Students are learning new concepts as well as how to work with new tools. This influx of information can be difficult for students to retain in their working memory as they construct their circuits. In this paper, we introduce BitBlox, a set of modular, solderless Breadboards for prototyping circuits. BitBlox attempts to decrease the cognitive load on the user by reducing the complexity found in the standard Breadboard by bringing visibility to the underlying connections within its modules. We present a comparative classroom study integrating the Breadboard and BitBlox into two different high school classes. Our qualitative analysis focuses on student errors, strategies, and collaborative practices, highlighting important dynamics for designing hardware tools.	1.2
The triclinic phase of zinc molybdate alpha-ZnMoO4 (ZMO) was synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method at 600 degrees C. The crystal structure of the obtained polycrystalline sample of ZMO was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rietveld calculations using the space group P-1. The electrical properties of alpha-ZnMoO4 compacted pellets were determined at room temperature from electrical impedance spectrometry (EIS), in the temperature range of 400-700 degrees C. Nyquist representations were interpreted in terms of two types of electrical circuits, involving a high frequency bulk component and a low frequency Warburg component. Analyses of the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary impedance show a non-Debye type relaxation. A phase transition corresponding to the allotropic transformation triclinic-monoclinic (alpha ->beta) of ZnMoO4 was observed in the temperature range of 450-500 degrees C, with a variation of activation energies. The Warburg component is discussed in terms of electrode surface reactions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.	1.2
Low impact development (LID) has attracted growing attention as an important approach for urban flood mitigation. Most studies evaluating LID performance for mitigating floods focus on the changes of peak flow and runoff volume. This paper assessed the performance of LID practices for mitigating flood inundation hazards as retrofitting technologies in an urbanized watershed in Nanjing, China. The findings indicate that LID practices are effective for flood inundation mitigation at the watershed scale, and especially for reducing inundated areas with a high flood hazard risk. Various scenarios of LID implementation levels can reduce total inundated areas by 2%-17% and areas with a high flood hazard level by 6%-80%. Permeable pavement shows better performance than rainwater harvesting against mitigating urban waterlogging. The most efficient scenario is combined rainwater harvesting on rooftops with a cistern capacity of 78.5 mm and permeable pavement installed on 75% of non -busy roads and other impervious surfaces. Inundation modeling is an effective approach to obtaining the information necessary to guide decision-making for designing LID practices at watershed scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobiological disorder that significantly impairs children's social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and behaviors. Questions about theory of mind (ToM) deficits in ASD have generated a large number of empirical studies. This article reviews current studies of the relationship between ToM and ASD, including contributions to the understanding of social and academic manifestations of ASD. Several themes emerge: Enhanced language and verbal abilities facilitate better ToM understanding; implicit ToM elements that incorporate parallel processing pose more difficulties than explicit ones; and general and multimodal interventions are more effective than specific interventions. A brief overview is followed by a review of emerging research on the role of domain-general cognitive skills (executive function) and central coherence in the development of ToM. Next, a summary of studies addressing ToM across the development and social and academic manifestations is presented. The article ends with a critical review of ToM intervention studies, which suggests that generalization may be more likely to occur when ToM is targeted as part of broader sociocognitive interventions rather than as an isolated skill.	2.3
The interest of the present work is focused on the improvement of the students learning process through the use of a Wiki-like platform. In our research The Wiki was intended as a mean in order to make easier the learning project. During the academic year 2011/2012 the Area of Manufacturing Engineering of the University of Oviedo was involved in a project which aim was the creation of a Wiki. Nowadays this software is used as auxiliary material for other subjects that are given by the Manufacturing Engineering Area in those new Engineering degrees that have been created in order to adapt the studies to the requirement of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). According to the results obtained by the students, it can be stated that the higher the mark of the student's Wiki the better his/her mark in the exam is.	3.2
In this paper, a novel adaptive synchronous rectification method for digitally controlled LLC converters is proposed. By sensing the synchronous rectifier (SR) body diode forward drop, both the SR turn-on and turn-off edges are optimized for efficiency. Negative current prevention is utilized to improve the system robustness and is enhanced by simple digital control capabilities. Compared with a conventional analog SR control approach, this method achieves higher system efficiency and flexibility. This control method has been implemented in a Texas Instruments digital power controller UCD3138A and a companion gate driver UCD7138 [1][2].	1.4
Human behaviour is context-dependent based on predictions and influenced by the environment and other people. We live in a dynamic world where both the, social stimuli and their context are constantly changing. Similar dynamic, natural stimuli should, in the future, be increasingly used to study social brain functions, with parallel development of appropriate signal-analysis methods. Understanding dynamic neural processes also requires accurate time-sensitive characterization of the behaviour. To go beyond the traditional stimulus response approaches, brain activity should be recorded simultaneously from two interacting subjects to reveal why human social interaction is critically different from just reacting to each other. This theme issue on Attending to and neglecting people contains original work and review papers on person perception and social interaction. The articles cover research from neuroscience, psychology, robotics, animal interaction research and microsociology. Some of the papers are co-authored by scientists who presented their own, independent views in the recent Attention and Performance XXVI conference but were brave enough to join forces with a colleague having a different background and views. In the future, information needs to converge across disciplines to provide us a more holistic view of human behaviour, its interactive nature, as well as the temporal dynamics of our social world.	2.2
A verification methodology is described and evaluated to formally determine uncertain linear systems stability in digital controllers with considerations to the implementation aspects. In particular, this methodology is combined with the digital-system verifier (DSVerifier), which is a verification tool that employs Bounded Model Checking based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories to check the stability of digital control systems with uncertainty. DSVerifier determines the control system stability, considering all the plant interval variation set, together with the Finite Word-length (FWL) effects in the digital controller implementation; DSVerifier checks the robust non-fragile stability of a given closed-loop system. The proposed methodology and respective tool are evaluated considering non-fragile control examples from literature. Experimental results show that the approach used in this study is able to foresee fragility problems in robust controllers, which could be overlooked by other existing approaches due to underestimating of FWL effects.	1.4
The current focus on delivery of personalised (or precision) medicine reflects the expectation that developments in genomics, imaging and other domains will extend our diagnostic and prognostic capabilities, and enable more effective targeting of current and future preventative and therapeutic options. The clinical benefits of this approach are already being realised in rare diseases and cancer but the impact on management of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, remains limited. This may reflect reliance on inappropriate models of disease architecture, based around rare, high-impact genetic and environmental exposures that are poorly suited to our emerging understanding of type 2 diabetes. This review proposes an alternative 'palette' model, centred on a molecular taxonomy that focuses on positioning an individual with respect to the major pathophysiological processes that contribute to diabetes risk and progression. This model anticipates that many individuals with diabetes will have multiple parallel defects that affect several of these processes. One corollary of this model is that research efforts should, at least initially, be targeted towards identifying and characterising individuals whose adverse metabolic trajectory is dominated by perturbation in a restricted set of processes.	6.4
The presence of psychological distress has a negative impact not only on cancer patients' quality of life but also on the course of the disease, with slower recovery and increased morbidity. These issues are of particular importance in melanoma patients (MP), who remain at risk of disease progression for many years after diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate psychological distress, coping strategies, and their possible relationships with demographic-clinical features in patients with early-stage melanoma in follow-up. The investigation focused in particular on whether the psychological profile differed between patients at different melanoma stages. Data of 118 patients with melanoma in the Tis-Ia stages (MP_Tis-Ia) and 86 patients with melanoma in the Ib-IIa-IIb stages (MP_Ib-II) were gathered through a self-administered survey and compared using a cross-sectional design. The results evidenced a high percentage of anxiety (25%) and distress symptoms (44%), whereas depressive symptoms seemed less frequent (8%). Psychological distress was higher in women than in men, and in patients with a higher educational level. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found between MP_Tis-Ia and MP_Ib-II. With respect to coping style, the patients in this sample adopted predominantly positive and active strategies. Correlational analyses showed that maladaptive coping strategies such as behavioral disengagement, denial, self-distraction, and self-blame were most strongly related to increased levels of psychological distress. The high presence of anxiety and distress symptoms, their relationship, and the use of negative coping strategies underline the importance of psychological distress screening also in early-stage MP, including at long-term follow-up.

A meminductor is a new type of memory device. It is of importance to study meminductor model and its application in nonlinear circuit prospectively. For this purpose, we present a novel mathematical model of meminductor, which considers the effects of internal state variable and therefore will be more consistent with future actual meminductor device. By using several operational amplifiers, multipliers, capacitors and resistors, the equivalent circuit of the model is designed for exploring its characteristics. This equivalent circuit can be employed to design meminductor-based application circuits as a meminductor emulator. By employing simulation experiment, we investigate the characteristics of this meminductor driven by sinusoidal excitation. The characteristic curves of current-flux (i-phi), voltage-flux (v-phi), v-rho (internal variable of meminductor) and phi-rho for the meminductor model are given by theoretical analyses and simulations. The curve of current-flux (i-phi) is a pinched hysteretic loop passing through the origin. The area bounding each sub-loop deforms as the frequency varies, and with the increase of frequency, the shape of the pinched hysteretic loop tends to be a straight line, indicating a dependence on frequency for the meminductor. Based on the meminductor model, a meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic oscillator is designed and analyzed. Some dynamical properties, including equilibrium points and the stability, bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent of the oscillator, are investigated in detail by theoretical analyses and simulations. By utilizing Lyapunov spectrum, bifurcation diagram and dynamical map, it is found that the system has periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic states. Furthermore, there exist some complicated nonlinear phenomena for the system, such as constant Lyapunov exponent spectrum and nonlinear amplitude modulation of chaotic signals. Moreover, we also find the nonlinear phenomena of coexisting bifurcation and coexisting attractors, including coexistence of two different chaotic attractors and coexistence of two different periodic attractors. The phenomenon shows that the state of this oscilator is highly sensitive to its initial valuse, not only for chaotic state but also for periodic state, which is called coexistent oscillation in this paper. The basic mechanism and potential applications of the existing attractors are illustrated, which can be used to generate robust pseudo random sequence, or multiplexed pseudo random sequence. Finally, by using the equivalent circuit of the proposed meminducive model, we realize an analog electronic circuit of the meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic system. The results of circuit experiment are displayed by the oscilloscope, which can verify the chaotic characteristics of the oscillator. The oscillator, as a pseudo random signal source, can be used to generate chaotic signals for the applications in chaotic cryptography and secret communications.	0.3
We previously reported the secretion of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) from vascular endothelial cells and proposed the existence of a vascular natriuretic peptide system composed of endothelial CNP and smooth muscle guanylyl cyclase-B (GC-B), the CNP receptor, and involved in the regulation of vascular tone, remodeling, and regeneration. In this study, we assessed the functional significance of this system in the regulation of blood pressure in vivo using vascular endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout and vascular smooth muscle cell-specific GC-B knockout mice. These mice showed neither the skeletal abnormality nor the early mortality observed in systemic CNP or GC-B knockout mice. Endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout mice exhibited significantly increased blood pressures and an enhanced acute hypertensive response to nitric oxide synthetase inhibition. Acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired in rings of mesenteric artery isolated from endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout mice. In addition, endothelin-1 gene expression was enhanced in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells from endothelial cell-specific CNP knockout mice, which also showed significantly higher plasma endothelin-1 concentrations and a greater reduction in blood pressure in response to an endothelin receptor antagonist than their control littermates. By contrast, vascular smooth muscle cell-specific GC-B knockout mice exhibited blood pressures similar to control mice, and acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation was preserved in their isolated mesenteric arteries. Nonetheless, CNP-induced acute vasorelaxation was nearly completely abolished in mesenteric arteries from vascular smooth muscle cell-specific GC-B knockout mice. These results demonstrate that endothelium-derived CNP contributes to the chronic regulation of vascular tone and systemic blood pressure by maintaining endothelial function independently of vascular smooth muscle GC-B.

Given two linear projections of maximal rank from P-k to P-h1 and P-h2 with k >= 3 and h(1) + h(2) >= k+1 the Grassmann tensor introduced by Hartley and Schaffalitzky (Int J Comput Vis 83(3):274-293, 2009. doi:10.1007/s11263-009-0225-1), turns out to be a generalized fundamental matrix. Such matrices are studied in detail and, in particular, their rank is computed. The dimension of the variety that parameterizes such matrices is also determined. An algorithmic application of the generalized fundamental matrix to projective reconstruction is described.	0.0
Background: The field of structural dynamics of cytoskeletons in living cells is gathering wide interest, since better understanding of cytoskeleton intracellular organization will provide us with not only insights into basic cell biology but may also enable development of new strategies in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy, fields in which cytoskeleton-dependent dynamics play a pivotal role. The nanoneedle technology is a powerful tool allowing for intracellular investigations, as it can be directly inserted into live cells by penetrating through the plasma membrane causing minimal damage to cells, under the precise manipulation using atomic force microscope. Modifications of the nanoneedles using antibodies have allowed for accurate mechanical detection of various cytoskeletal components, including actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments. However, successful penetration of the nanoneedle through the plasma membrane has been shown to vary greatly between different cell types and conditions. In an effort to overcome this problem and improve the success rate of nanoneedle insertion into the live cells, we have focused here on the fluidity of the membrane lipid bilayer, which may hinder nanoneedle penetration into the cytosolic environment. Results: We aimed to reduce apparent fluidity of the membrane by either increasing the approach velocity or reducing experimental temperatures. Although changes in approach velocity did not have much effect, lowering the temperature was found to greatly improve the detection of unbinding forces, suggesting that alteration in the plasma membrane fluidity led to increase in nanoneedle penetration. Conclusions: Operation at a lower temperature of 4 degrees C greatly improved the success rate of nanoneedle insertion to live cells at an optimized approach velocity, while it did not affect the binding of antibodies immobilized on the nanoneedle to vimentins for mechanical detection. As these experimental parameters can be applied to various cell types, these results may improve the versatility of the nanoneedle technology to other cell lines and platforms.	6.1
This article explores the ethical issues that have been identified in emerging technologies, from early genetic engineering to synthetic biology. The scientific advances in the field form a continuum, and some ethical considerations can be raised time and again when new developments occur. An underlying concern is the cumulative effect of scientific advances and ensuing technological innovation that can change our understanding of life and humanity.	6.4
Dual boundary integral equation (BIE) was developed for problems containing degenerate boundaries in 1988 by Hong and Chen [Journal of Engineering Mechanics-ASCE, 114, 6, 1988] and was termed the dual boundary element method (BEM) in 1992 by Portela et al. [International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 33, 6, 1992]. After near 30 years, the dual BIE/BEM for the problem containing a zero-thickness barrier was revisited mathematically to study the rank deficiency from the viewpoint of the updating term and the updating document of singular value decomposition (SVD) [Journal of Mechanics, 31, 5, 2015]. In this paper, we revisit the dual BEM from the physical point of view. Although there is no zero-thickness barrier in the real world, it is always required to simulate a finite-thickness degenerate boundary to be zero-thickness in comparison with sea, air or earth scale. For example, a sheet pile, a screen, a crack problem, a thin airfoil and a breakwater were modeled by the geometry of zero-thickness. The role of the dual BEM is evident since Lafe et al. [Journal of the Hydraulics Division-ASCE, 106, 6, 1980] used the conventional BEM to model the finite-thickness pile wall to geometrically approximate zero-thickness barrier but numerically yielding divergent solution. On the contrary, we physically model the finite-thickness breakwater as a zero-thickness barrier. The breakwater is employed as an illustrative case to demonstrate that the dual BEM simulated by a zero-thickness barrier can yield more acceptable results to match the experiment data in comparison with those of the finite thickness using the conventional BEM. Finally, a single horizontal plate and two dual horizontal plates in vertical direction and in horizontal direction are three illustrative cases to tell you why the dual BEM is necessary not only in mathematics but also in physics.	3.1
ARINC 653 provides a strong isolation mechanism for safety computing fields, such as aircrafts. seL4, a 3rd generation microkernel, was formally verified for its functional correctness and provides a desirable code base for partitioning operating systems. But there is a long way from seL4 to partitioning. We take the first step and focus on the temporal aspect, i.e., implementing a partitioned scheduler based on seL4. However, seL4 implements a stiff scheduler inside the kernel, which conflicts with the genera principles(eg. ARINC 653 standard) of temporal partitioning. To address this problem, we propose a user-mode approach. We also elaborate performance of our scheduler.	0.4
In recent years, the development of CFD simulations has increased the knowledge in fluid-structure interaction problems. This trend has been particularly important for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) and sailing boats. However, especially for these sectors, in which two different fluids are involved, the reliability of CFD prediction tools requires further experimental validations. To this end, as a complementary approach with respect to ocean wave basins, there is the need for wind tunnel aero-elastic dynamic tests. This paper presents the customization of a 6-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) motion-simulator device for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind tunnel tests on floating scale models. Each step of the machine design-loop is motivated and described: the kinetostatic synthesis is obtained through a multi-objective optimization using a genetic algorithm, the inverse dynamic properties are mapped on the workspace, and finally the drive system is mechanically sized using the so called alpha-beta theory. The emphasis is placed on the mechatronic design methodology, so that different mechanisms and requirements may be considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.3
The initial value problems of nonlinear or stiff ordinary differential equation appear in many fields of engineering science, particularly in the studies of electrical circuits, chemical reactions, wave vibration and so on. In this research, the standard homotopy analysis method hybrids with Laplace transform method to solve nonlinear and stiff differential equations. Using this modification, the problems solved by LHAM successfully yield good solutions. Some examples are examined to highlight the convenience and effectiveness of LHAM.	1.2
This paper investigates the applicability, reliability and economic benefit of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems to partially offset the daily water demand in the multistoried residential buildings in combination with the town water supply systems in Dhaka city. A comprehensive computer software was developed with a view to assessing the reliability and feasibility of the RWH systems in an urban setup. The software was developed using daily water balance modelling concept, which uses input data like daily rainfall, roof catchment area, runoff losses and tank volume. Three distinct climatic scenarios, i.e. wet, average and dry years were chosen by analysing historical 20-years daily rainfall data. Typical residential buildings of plot size 2.5-5.0 katha (168-335 m(2)) were considered for the study. Results indicated that about 15-25% reliability can be achieved under the wet climatic condition and for catchment sizes varying from 140 m(2) to 200 m(2), 250 kL to 550 kL of rainwater can be harvested each year. Several reliability curves have been presented for two roof catchment sizes (140 m(2) and 200 m(2)) under three climatic scenarios and an insignificant increase in the reliability of the RWH system beyond the tank volume of 30 m(3) was observed. The current underground tank sizes of the residential buildings are sufficient to prevent the potential overflow during monsoon. A monetary saving of around 2000 BDT can be achieved for the catchment size of 140 m(2) with tank size of 40 m(3) under average year climate condition and the monetary saving increases with increase in catchment size.

Nanovesicles (similar to 100 nm) are ubiquitous in cell biology and an important vector for drug delivery. Mechanical properties of vesicles are known to influence cellular uptake, but the mechanism by which deformation dynamics affect internalization is poorly understood. This is partly due to the fact that experimental studies of the mechanics of such vesicles remain challenging, particularly at the nanometer scale where appropriate theoretical models have also been lacking. Here, we probe the mechanical properties of nanoscale liposomes using atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation. The mechanical response of the nanovesicles shows initial linear behavior and subsequent flattening corresponding to inward tether formation. We derive a quantitative model, including the competing effects of internal pressure and membrane bending, that corresponds well to these experimental observations. Our results are consistent with a bending modulus of the lipid bilayer of similar to 1.4k(b)T. Surprisingly, we find that vesicle stiffness is pressure dominated for adherent vesicles under physiological conditions. Our experimental method and quantitative theory represents a robust approach to study the mechanics of nanoscale vesicles, which are abundant in biology, as well as being of interest for the rational design of liposomal vectors for drug delivery.	6.1
Bone remodelling, which maintains bone mass constant during adulthood, is an energy-demanding process. This, together with the observation that the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is a major inhibitor of bone remodelling, led to the hypothesis that bone cells regulate energy metabolism through an endocrine mechanism. Studies to test this hypothesis identified osteocalcin, a hormone secreted by osteoblasts, as a positive regulator of insulin secretion, insulin resistance and energy expenditure. Remarkably, insulin signalling in osteoblasts is a positive regulator of osteocalcin production and activation via its ability to indirectly enhance bone resorption by osteoclasts. In contrast, leptin is a potent inhibitor of osteocalcin function through its effect on the sympathetic tone. Hence, osteocalcin is part of a complex signalling network between bone and the organs more classically associated with the regulation of energy homeostasis, such as the pancreas and adipose tissue. This review summarises the molecular and cellular bases of the present knowledge on osteocalcin biology and discusses the potential relevance of osteocalcin to human metabolism and pathology.	6.2
The genetic differentiation among the populations of the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata was investigated using different markers to better understand the evolutionary history and exchanges between populations. Three markers were used: mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), the sperm lysin nuclear gene, and eight nuclear microsatellites. These markers present different characteristics concerning mutation rate and inheritance, which provided complementary information about abalone history and gene diversity. Genetic diversity and relationships among subspecies were calculated from a sample of approximately 500 individuals, collected from 17 different locations in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, Macaronesia, and Mediterranean Sea. COI marker was used to explore the phylogeny of the species with a network analysis and two phylogenetic methods. The analysis revealed 18 major haplotypes grouped into two distinct clades with a pairwise sequence divergence up to 3.5 %. These clades do not correspond to subspecies but revealed many contacts along Atlantic coast during the Pleistocene interglaciations. The sperm lysin gene analysis separated two different subtaxa: one associated to Macaronesian islands, and the other to all other populations. Moreover, a small population of the northern subtaxon was isolated in the Adriatic Seaprobably before the separation of the two lineages-and evolved independently. Microsatellites were analyzed by different genetics methods, including the Bayesian clustering method and migration patterns analysis. It revealed genetically distinct microsatellite patterns among populations from Mediterranean Sea, Brittany and Normandy, Morocco, and Canary and Balearic islands. Gene flow is asymmetric among the regions; the Azores and the Canary Islands are particularly isolated and have low effective population sizes. Our results support the hypothesis that climate changes since the Pleistocene glaciations have played a major role in the geographic distribution of the European abalone. Traces of these events related to maternal inheritance were shown on COI marker.	6.4
In due consideration of the growing importance of chemical sensors for the detection and quantification of toxic heavy metal ions to counter water pollution, a novel class of tellurium-based organic receptors has been investigated as a potentially sensitive and selective silver-ion probe in the present work. The new tellurium-incorporated Schiff base ligand (R1) was chemically synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Upon an exposure of organic nanoparticles (N1) of the title receptor ligand (R1) to a pool of select heavy metal ions, the former displayed high sensitivity and selectivity towards silver ions, in aqueous medium, with a detection limit of 2.34 nM. Interestingly, the presence of metal ions bearing close physico-chemical resemblance to silver exerted negligible interference in the ultra-sensitive detection of silver ions by the title probe Nl. Furthermore, the precision and accuracy of the potential silver-ion sensor (N1) in aqueous medium was established across a wide pH range as well as under saline conditions. The analytical utility of this potential silver-ion probe R1 was further investigated for real sample analysis of objects of environmental applicability. The results of the same were authenticated by using atomic absorption spectroscopy. In summary, an investigation into the utility of a new class of tellurium-based organic receptors as potential metal-ion sensors opens a new avenue into the rather poorly-comprehended environmental relevance of organotellurium chemistry.

Water scarcity, pertaining to many interrelated issues e.g. rapid urbanisation and increasing water pollution, has been acknowledged around the world. Water reuse has emerged as a viable water conservation measure to satisfy water demand in many communities. Among the diversity of wastewater treatment processes, membrane assisted treatment technologies have been employed for different water reuse scenarios. In this regard, one of the most critical problems is how to select an appropriate membrane technology for a water reuse scenario. This research therefore develops a decision making framework for selection of wastewater treatment technology. The framework is applied to different non-potable reuse scenarios in South African cities and suburban areas by employing a multi criteria analysis method. The results show that this approach is able to provide a systematic and rigorous analysis which can help in comparing and selecting wastewater technologies.	4.4
The main tendency of rolling mills drives modernization is outdated analog control systems replacement with new digital ones. At the same time, a power section of the drive remains the same. This gives an opportunity to develop and implement adaptive digital control system for such plants in order to take into consideration their high nonlinearity. Having considered different types of such systems, the ones which does not change the well-accepted PID control algorithm, but tune its parameters KP, KI, KD are believed to have the highest chances to be applied into industry. The main aim of this research is to develop and apply a neural tuner to adjust armature current PI-controller parameters of a two-high reversing rolling mill drive online. The neural tuner consists of 1) a neural network calculating KP and KI values and trained online with the help of backpropagation method and 2) a rule base, which conditions is used to estimate transient quality, whereas consequences are values of a learning rate of the network output layer neurons. Modeling experiments are conducted with a model of the plant under consideration. They are used to check the ability of the tuner to: 1) adjust the PI-controller parameters back to optimal values; 2) cope with an armature winding parameters drift. Such experiments are conducted both for the systems with the neural tuner and a conventional PI-controller. As far as the second type of experiments is concerned, the system with the neural tuner is able to achieve 2% energy consumption decrease comparing to a conventional PI-controller based control system.	1.4
In this paper, we present the evaluation of a DBD reactor that generates an energy per pulse of 65.3 mJ in order to inactivate E. coli ATCC 8739 at 10(3), 10(6), and 10(8) CFU/mL order concentrations and E. cloacae CDBB-B-963 at 10(3) and 10(7) CFU/mL order concentrations, in a volume of water flowing continuously. Particularly, experimentation is focused in 500 mL, under atmospheric pressure. The DBD reactor was coupled to a peristaltic pump type, a cooling jacket, containers for water in treatment and cooling fluid, and systems to monitor the experimental conditions. The implementation of the experiments was carried out at three different fluid flow rates: 2.0 +/- 0.1, 3.5 +/- 0.1, and 4.4 +/- 0.1 mL/s; in each of them the time required to carry out a cycle of treatment corresponded to 256 +/- 7, 143 +/- 2, and 113 +/- 1 s, respectively. During the DBD application, water flowed continuously at recirculation mode, promoting the continuous oxygen injection at 8.3 mL/s. In the three established fluid flow rates, the efficacy of treatment reached 100% in inactivation of E. coli bacteria at 10(3) and 10(6) order concentrations at the end of the first cycle of treatment. At 10(8) CFU/mL order concentration, complete inactivation of E. coli bacteria was achieved at the end of the fourth cycle of treatment. Meanwhile, E. cloacae bacteria showed an inactivation of 100% at the end of the first cycle of treatment at 10(3) order concentration; when the order concentration increased to 10(7), the efficacy of the process depended on the fluid flow rate, at 3.5 +/- 0.1 and 2.0 +/- 0.1 mL/s survival was 0% at the end of the first cycle of treatment; nevertheless, at the highest (4.4 +/- 0.1 mL/s), an additional cycle was required.	4.4
Introduction: At present, treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is still mainly based on drugs acting on glycemic and blood pressure control, as there is no validated therapy able to halt the progression of renal failure. Because of the high incidence of DKD, due to the increase of diabetes mellitus in general population, new therapeutic strategies are needed.Areas covered: We analysed ongoing and already completed clinical trials, from clinicaltrials.gov and PubMed, dealing with new therapies for DKD.Expert opinion: Among the drugs currently being explored, the most promising molecules are those that interfere with glucose-dependent pathways, in particular polyol, protein kinase, hexosamine and AGEs metabolic pathways, and impaired renal vascular regulation. One of the recent goals achieved by molecular biology is the development of monoclonal antibodies able to interfere with extracellular matrix accumulation and fibrosis. Other interesting therapies are under investigation and further studies with a greater number of patients will establish a better approach for diabetic nephropathy.	6.0
Clinical assessment of immediate in-brace effect of braces designed using CAD/CAM and FEM vs. only CAD/CAM for conservative treatment of AIS, using a randomized blinded and controlled study design. Forty AIS patients were prospectively recruited and randomized into two groups. For 19 patients (control group), the brace was designed using a scan of patient's torso and a conventional CAD/CAM approach (CtrlBrace). For the 21 other patients (test group), the brace was additionally designed using finite element modeling (FEM) and 3D reconstructions of spine, rib cage and pelvis (NewBrace). The NewBrace design was simulated and iteratively optimized to maximize the correction and minimize the contact surface and material. Both groups had comparable age, sex, weight, height, curve type and severity. Scoliosis Research Society standardized criteria for bracing were followed. Average Cobb angle prior to bracing was 27A degrees and 28A degrees for main thoracic (MT) and lumbar (L) curves, respectively, for the control group, while it was 33A degrees and 28A degrees for the test group. CtrlBraces reduced MT and L curves by 8A degrees (29 %) and 10A degrees (40 %), respectively, compared to 14A degrees (43 %) and 13A degrees (46 %) for NewBraces, which were simulated with a difference inferior to 5A degrees. NewBraces were 50 % thinner and had 20 % less covering surface than CtrlBraces. Braces designed with CAD/CAM and 3D FEM simulation were more efficient and lighter than standard CAD/CAM TLSO's at first immediate in-brace evaluation. These results suggest that long-term effect of bracing in AIS may be improved using this new platform for brace fabrication. NCT02285621.	3.0
Neural networks are becoming central in several areas of computer vision and image processing and different architectures have been proposed to solve specific problems. The impact of the loss layer of neural networks, however, has not received much attention in the context of image processing: the default and virtually only choice is l(2). In this paper, we bring attention to alternative choices for image restoration. In particular, we show the importance of perceptually-motivated losses when the resulting image is to be evaluated by a human observer. We compare the performance of several losses, and propose a novel, differentiable error function. We show that the quality of the results improves significantly with better loss functions, even when the network architecture is left unchanged.	0.0
The current study examines how discrete emotions function in the manifestation of the third-person effect of news coverage of election poll results. An online survey was conducted employing a sample of undergraduate students from the United States (n = 197) and South Korea (n = 178) before the 2012 presidential elections in the two countries. Results demonstrate that third-person perception is negatively associated with pride, which, in turn, is positively linked to political participation intention only for the supporters of a losing candidate. For U.S. respondents, third-person perception is positively associated with anger, which is positively associated with support for restrictions on polling news. For South Korean respondents, the mediation of anxiety between third-person perception and political participation intention is significant for the supporters of a losing candidate. Implications of the findings are discussed.	2.2
Three studies contribute to the literature on dominance and nonverbal behavior (Ellyson & Dovidio, 1985) by examining how a man's choice to shave his head influences person perception. In Study 1, men with shaved heads were rated as more dominant than similar men with full heads of hair. In Study 2, men whose hair was digitally removed were perceived as more dominant, taller, and stronger than their authentic selves. Study 3 extends these results with nonphotographic stimuli and demonstrates how men experiencing natural hair loss may improve their interpersonal standing by shaving. Theories of signaling, norm violation, and stereotypes are examined as explanations for the effect. Practical implications for men's psychological, social, and economic outlooks are also discussed.	2.2
Main conclusion Overexpression of the citrus CsTIP2;1 improves plant growth and tolerance to salt and drought stresses by enhancing cell expansion, H (2) O (2) detoxification and stomatal conductance. Tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs) are a subfamily of aquaporins, belonging to the major intrinsic protein family. In a previous study, we have shown that a citrus TIP isoform, CsTIP2;1, is highly expressed in leaves and also transcriptionally regulated in leaves and roots by salt and drought stresses and infection by 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', the causal agent of the Huanglongbing disease, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of the flow of water and nutrients required during both normal growth and stress conditions. Here, we show that the overexpression of CsTIP2;1 in transgenic tobacco increases plant growth under optimal and water- and salt-stress conditions and also significantly improves the leaf water and oxidative status, photosynthetic capacity, transpiration rate and water use efficiency of plants subjected to a progressive soil drying. These results correlated with the enhanced mesophyll cell expansion, midrib aquiferous parenchyma abundance, H2O2 detoxification and stomatal conductance observed in the transgenic plants. Taken together, our results indicate that CsTIP2;1 plays an active role in regulating the water and oxidative status required for plant growth and adaptation to stressful environmental conditions and may be potentially useful for engineering stress tolerance in citrus and other crop plants.	3.1
Communicative skills of chimpanzees are of significant interest across many domains, such as developmental psychology (how does communication emerge in prelinguistic beings?), evolution (e.g., did human language evolve from primate gestures?), and in comparative psychology (how does the nonverbal communication of chimpanzees and humans compare?). Here we ask about how gestures develop in chimpanzee infants (n=16) that were raised in an interactive program designed to study skill development. Data on socio-communicative development were collected following 4hr of daily interaction with each infant, longitudinally from birth through the first year of life. A consistent and significant developmental pattern was found across the contexts of tickle play, grooming, and chase play: Infant chimpanzees first engaged in interactions initiated by others, then they initiated interactions, and finally, they requested others to join them in the interaction. Gestures were documented for initiating and requesting tickle play, for initiating and requesting grooming, and for initiating and requesting chase play. Gestural requests emerged significantly later than gestural initiations, but the age at which gestures emerged was significantly different across contexts. Those gestures related to hierarchical rank relations, that is, gestures used by subordinates in interaction with more dominant individuals, such as wrist presenting and rump presenting, did not emerge in the same manner as the other gestures. This study offers a new view on the development of gestures, specifically that many develop through interaction and communicate socio-emotional desires, but that not all gestures emerge in the same manner.

Novel functionalized geotextiles were prepared through chemical functionalization of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) non-woven material by chitosan by using a coating technique with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) as the cross-linking agent. The prepared functionalized geotextiles were characterized by using different surface analyses and they show that the chitosan was successfully coated on PET non-woven materials. The ability of the prepared geotextiles to remove some heavy metals (Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+) from the aqueous solution was also evaluated.	4.1
A sustainable strategy for conjunctive water management must include information on the temporal and spatial availability of this natural resource. Because of water shortages in the dry seasons, farmers on the Upper Plain of the Chao Phraya River basin, Thailand, are increasingly using groundwater to meet their irrigation needs. To evaluate the possibilities of conjunctive water management in the area, the spatial-temporal changes in the water table of the Younger Terrace Aquifer were investigated. First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas that would be more suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the natural hydrogeological processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential.	4.2
Objective: Microbiota has an important role in human metabolism, nutrition, immunity, and protection against colonization by pathogenic microorganisms. Radiation can harm the beneficial members of the gastrointestinal tract flora. Methods: Our study included 75 rural children aged 4-18 years, who lived in contaminated area exposed to natural environmental radiation with clinical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and 20 healthy urban participants aged 5-15 as control group. The intestinal bacterial microbiota was examined from stool samples. Findings: Our results indicated the population levels of microbiota such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Bifidbacterium in caecal contents in 61 subjects (81.3%) was significantly less than in control group. Conclusion: We investigated alternation of the intestinal microbiota affected by ionizing radiation in children with clinical symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.	6.2
Inflammation is an elaborate reflex response of the body to the action of harmful agents. This reaction manifests itself in the form of functional and structural changes of vascular tissues. The inflammatory response is the result of the human evolutionary process. It has three main stages, which are closely related to each other and evolve simultaneously: tissue dystrophy (alteration); impairment of blood circulation (transudation of fluid and migration of leukocytes) and multiplication of cellular elements (proliferation). These phenomena express both a disturbance of biological activity in body tissues and the defense mechanisms to restore the damaged areas. There are two interrelated processes which are often inseparable from each other in the inflammatory response. First, there is the pathological process itself, the tissue damage in form of dystrophy, necrobiosis or necrosis. Second, there is the physiological mechanism of defense, the process of recovery or the physiological response against the disease, manifested as exudation, phagocytosis and proliferation. Simultaneity of both processes is characteristic to inflammatory processes.	6.0
On the basis of an integration of dual-process models of information processing and the lens model framework of person perception, we conducted two studies to investigate whether self-perceivers could detect their implicit disposition from video feedback of behavioural cues and whether these cues were used for explicit dispositional inferences under conditions that maximized the presumed self-perception process. Using an approach that differed from previous research, we used the following: (i) a more detailed and stepwise self-perception procedure; (ii) a specific explicit measure compared with a global explicit measure; and (iii) disgust sensitivity as a domain with clear, unambiguous cues and an assumed low self-presentation bias. The results from two studies (N=117 and N=130) on disgust sensitivity provide the first evidence for the assumed process with regard to bodily reaction cues but not with regard to facial expression cues. These novel findings suggest that people can get to know their unconscious selves better if supporting conditions are met and the right behavioural cues are attended to. Additional boundary conditions of this self-perception process were investigated using display rules and need for closure in Study 2. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	2.2
Smart cards are well-known tamper-resistant devices, and due to their portability and security they represent an excellent platform for implementing strong authentication services. This contribution analyses three Spanish smart card deployments intended to be used for eGoverment services, comparing their respective contents and capabilities. As a result of our analysis, we conclude that the current deployment of smart cards for the electronic prescription service being rolled out throughout Spain could be replaced by the use of the already consolidated Spanish National Identity card.	0.3
Despite the popularity of cause-related marketing (CRM), the socially-oriented drivers that influence the success of CRM have yet to be investigated empirically in the hospitality context. This study investigated the effects of three factors (status motive, guilt, and recognition) on customers' attitudes and intent to participate in CRM promotions through social media. A scenario-based 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects experimental design was used. Results revealed that status-seeking individuals exhibited the high level of prosocial behavior when their behavior was recognized by others publicly compared to non status seeking individuals. In addition, individuals who felt guilt with regards to a CRM promotional appeal were more likely to respond to the promotion positively than those who did not, when their goodwill was observable by others. Considering this desire of some customers to have their goodwill displayed to others (known as conspicuous prosocial behavior), this study provides important evidence for companies wishing to develop CRM strategies via social media.

In the transition to renewable energy systems, fluctuating renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, plays a large and important role. This creates a challenge in terms of meeting demands, as the energy production fluctuates based on weather patterns. To utilise high amounts of fluctuating renewable energy, the energy system has to be more flexible in terms of decoupling demand and production. This paper investigates two potential ways to increase flexibility. The first is the interconnection between energy systems, for instance between two countries, labelled as cross-border interconnection, and the second is cross-sector interconnection, i.e., the integration between different parts of an energy system, for instance heat and electricity. This paper seeks to compare the types of interconnectivity and discuss to which extent they are mutually beneficial. To do this, the study investigates two energy systems that represent Northern and Southern Europe. Both systems go through three developmental steps that increase the cross-sector interconnectivity. At each developmental step an increasing level of transmission capacities is examined to identify the benefits of cross-border interconnectivity. The results show that while both measures increase the system utilisation of renewable energy and the system efficiency, the cross-sector interconnection gives the best system performance. To analyse the possible interaction between cross-sector and cross-border interconnectivity, two main aspects have to be clarified. The first part defines the approach and the second is the construction of the two archetypes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
The removal of dye from industrial wastewater is one of the most important subjects in water pollution regulation. Successive adsorption/desorption cycles of a basic dye, methylene blue, on internal almond shell, olive stone and rye straw were investigated by using fixed bed column experiments to study the adsorption capacity to remove the MB and adsorbents regeneration efficiency. The adsorption breakthrough curves were predicted by the Thomas model, Yoon Nelson model, and Wolborska model and modified dose-response model by using nonlinear regressive analysis. The adsorption capacity values obtained by this model are compared with the experimental capacity, noting an error of 16%, 27.8% and 18.9% for IAS, OS and RS respectively, but these errors are minimized in the second cycle to 22.98% and 6.06% for OS and RS respectively. The results show that the modified dose response model is more suitable for the description of breakthrough curves for three adsorbents only in the first cycle. The IAS presents the highest adsorption capacity and the best regeneration efficiency. Conversely, the RS presents lower adsorption capacity, whereas is not the hardest to regenerate.	4.4
We discuss touch-based navigation of 3D visualizations in a combined monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing environment. We identify a set of interaction modes, and a workflow that helps users transition between these modes to improve their interaction experience. In our discussion we analyze, in particular, the control-display space mapping between the different reference frames of the stereoscopic and monoscopic displays. We show how this mapping supports interactive data exploration, but may also lead to conflicts between the stereoscopic and monoscopic views due to users' movement in space; we resolve these problems through synchronization. To support our discussion, we present results from an exploratory observational evaluation with domain experts in fluid mechanics and structural biology. These experts explored domain-specific datasets using variations of a system that embodies the interaction modes and workflows; we report on their interactions and qualitative feedback on the system and its workflow.	3.4
Long non coding RNAs (IcRNAs) are associated with various biological roles such as embryogenesis, stem cell biology, cellular development and present specific tissue expression profiles. Aberrant expression of IncRNAs are thought to play a critical role in the progression and development of various cancer types, including gliomas. Glioblastomas (GBM) are common and malignant primary brain tumours. Brain cancer stem cells (BCSC) are isolated from both low and high-grade tumours in adults and children, by cell fraction which express neuronal stem cell surface marker CD133. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression profiles of IncRNAs in brain tumour cells and determine its potential biological function. For this purpose, U118MG-U87MG; GBM stem cell series were used. Human parental brain cancer cells were included as the control group; the expressions of disease related human IncRNA profiles were studied by LightCycler 480 real-time PCR. Expression profiles of 83 lncRNA genes were analyzed for a significant dysregulation, compared to the control cells. Among IncRNAs, 51 IncRNA genes down-regulated, while 8 IncRNA genes were up-regulated. PCAT-1 (2.36), MEG3 (5.34), HOTAIR (-2.48) lncRNAs showed low expression in glioblastoma compared to the human (parental) brain cancer stem cells, indicating their role as tumour suppressor genes on gliomas. As a result, significant changes for anti-cancer gene expressions were detected with disease-related human IncRNA array plates. Identification of novel target genes may lead to promising developments in human brain cancer treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	6.1
Reverse engineering demands a fast and accurate measuring method to obtain the surface model of an object when its computer-aided design (CAD) model is not available. Blending the advantages of both contact probes and non-contact scanners has been the trend of reverse engineering development for the past 15 years. Current research on hybrid reverse engineering system focuses on sensor selection, scanning path planning, and coordinate system registration and unification, but lacks of interaction between the data groups from the touch probe and laser sensor. The objective of this research is directed toward improving data accuracy at a reduced amount of data points without complex instrument integration and is accomplished through combining the advantages of contact probes and non-contact scanners and meanwhile offsetting their disadvantages. In this research, data from the laser sensor is strategically selected based on the local surface variation, and a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) touch probe is used to enhance data accuracy. A Cell Merging algorithm is implemented to reduce the amount of data based on a newly proposed concept of Break Points, by which a Hermit bicubic relation is maintained among neighboring sampling points while a hybrid reverse engineering process is going on. At the end of the paper, examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the methodology.	3.0
In the paper, a solution for series multiple fan systems control is presented. Their applicability in modern building or mine ventilation systems is obvious. In order to validate the proposed solution an experimental stand and a real time software have been developed. The control algorithm is based on three multiple models system configurations, each one consisting in three operating systems, specific to the experimental stand.	0.4
The search for the prosocial personality has been long and controversial. The current research explores the general patterns underlying prosocial decisions, linking personality, emotion, and overt prosocial behavior. Using a multimethod approach, we explored the links between the Big Five dimensions of personality and prosocial responding. Across three studies, we found that agreeableness was the dimension of personality most closely associated with emotional reactions to victims in need of help, and subsequent decisions to help those individuals. Results suggest that prosocial processes, including emotions, cognitions, and behaviors, may be part of a more general motivational process linked to personality.	2.4
Zymoseptoria tritici, the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch, a serious foliar disease of wheat, is a necrotrophic pathogen that undergoes a long latent period. Emergence of insensitivity to fungicides, and pesticide reduction policies, mean there is a pressing need to understand septoria and control it through greater varietal resistance. Stb6 and Stb15, the most common qualitative resistance genes in modern wheat cultivars, determine specific resistance to avirulent fungal genotypes following a gene-for-gene relationship. This study investigated compatible and incompatible interactions of wheat with Z. tritici using eight combinations of cultivars and isolates, with the aim of identifying molecular responses that could be used as markers for disease resistance during the early, symptomless phase of colonization. The accumulation of TaMPK3 was estimated using western blotting, and the expression of genes implicated in gene-for-gene interactions of plants with a wide range of other pathogens was measured by qRT-PCR during the presymptomatic stages of infection. Production of TaMPK3 and expression of most of the genes responded to inoculation with Z. tritici but varied considerably between experimental replicates. However, there was no significant difference between compatible and incompatible interactions in any of the responses tested. These results demonstrate that the molecular biology of the gene-for-gene interaction between wheat and Zymoseptoria is unlike that in many other plant diseases, indicate that environmental conditions may strongly influence early responses of wheat to infection by Z. tritici, and emphasize the importance of including both compatible and incompatible interactions when investigating the biology of this complex pathosystem.	6.0
This paper develops and compares several optimization approaches for the version planning and release problem. This problem is new, challenging for scholars and practitioners, and was not fully addressed in the OR literature. Version releases are part of a wide-spread phenomenon. Mobile phones, operating systems (e.g. MS-Windows) and digital printers are well known examples. However, version release can be found in many other product development fields, such as software products and games, and hardware versions (e.g. TV, screens, communication equipment etc.). In some fields (such as the automotive field) the version release is so well-established that it became an annual routine. An optimization formulation is developed for the total-value of a version-release policy throughout the relevant time-horizon. The novel formulation elements are release-features and release-dates. The value of each release is derived from the combination of features included in the specific released version, and the version release-dates. We developed several search techniques for solving this strongly NP-hard problem. We compared the results of (1) multiple particle swarm optimization (MPSO) (2) Genetic Algorithm (GA), (3) simulated annealing (SA), (4 & 5) two forms of greedy heuristics. A comprehensive computational experiment was performed. The study shows that GA and MPSO outperform the other methods. Moreover, for medium scale problems, GA better suits highly resource-constrained cases, while MPSO performs best for large scale problems disregarding the resource scarcity. This research may be a major reference point for future research on the version release problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.4
Image encryption has been an attractive research field in recent years. The chaos-based cryptographic algorithms have suggested some new and efficient ways to develop secure image encryption techniques. This paper proposes a novel image encryption scheme, which is based on the chaotic tent map. Image encryption systems based on such map show some better performances. Firstly, the chaotic tent map is modified to generate chaotic key stream that is more suitable for image encryption. Secondly, the chaos-based key stream is generated by a 1-D chaotic tent map, which has a better performance in terms of randomness properties and security level. The performance and security analysis of the proposed image encryption scheme is performed using well-known ways. The results of the fail-safe analysis are inspiring, and it can be concluded that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure.	0.3
In many scientific fields, empirical models are employed to facilitate computational simulations of engineering systems. For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated person perception in respect of variables associated with affect in music (tempo and mode) following motor synchronization to music. Participants (n = 128, 50% female) were tested in a task involving stepping with a researcher to the beat of slow or fast music in major or minor mode, following which measures concerning the synchronised partner were collected (incidental memory, likeability of, similarity to and prosocial attitude towards). Significant effects were found only for the 'likeability' measure, modulated by gender, suggesting that variables associated with affect perception in music, such as mode and tempo appear relevant for person perception in a synchronization task in ways that differ for men and women. The results of this 'proof of concept' study indicate the need for further research on the effect of motor synchronization based on ecologically valid musical interaction tasks.	2.2
Runoff is one of the main sources of contamination in urban areas, since water can transport pollutants from many different media, among which the hydrocarbons generated by vehicles have an especially significant relevance. Under this premise, the study of geotextiles used as water purification layers within pervious pavement structures becomes a crucial issue, since these fabrics have proved to be a suitable environment for the development of biofilms, which are groups of microorganisms capable of reducing the presence of hydrocarbons. For this reason, this paper proposes a first test to assess the capacity of ten different geotextiles by immersing them in a culture medium prepared to favour the growth of a microbial community. The results showed the major importance of geotextile thickness in the generation of biomass and its relationship to the manufacturing process of the fabric, either heat-sealing or needle-punching. Consequently, a second test was developed to measure the mechanical behaviour of a geotextile of each type when buried in a microbially active soil under different conditions. The comparison between exposed and control samples revealed the maintenance of strength-related properties of geotextiles in the presence of microorganisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Cell division is a fascinating and fundamental process that sustains life. By this process, unicellular organisms reproduce and multicellular organisms sustain development, growth, and tissue repair. Division of a mother cell gives rise to two daughter cells according to an ordered set of events within four successive phases called G1 (gap1), S (DNA S ynthesis), G2 (gap2), and M (Mitosis) phase. How these different phases are orchestrated to ensure the physical separation of the two daughter cells is a tightly regulated process. Indeed, inappropriate cell division could lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and ultimately to cancer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system for unraveling the secrets of cell division. A large community of researchers has chosen budding yeast as a model because of its advantages: rapid growth in simple and economical media, tractable genetics, powerful biochemistry, cell biology, and proteomics approaches. Furthermore, the cell cycle mechanisms, as elucidated in yeast, are conserved in higher eukaryotes. The ability to synchronize and get large numbers of cells in a particular stage of the cell cycle is crucial to properly explore the mechanisms of the cell cycle. An overview of the most common yeast synchronization techniques has been compiled in this chapter.	6.1
Most prokaryote-secreted proteins are transported to the cell surface using either the general secretion (Sec) or twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. A majority of secreted proteins are anchored to the cell surface, while the remainder are released into the extracellular environment. The anchored surface proteins play a variety of important roles in cellular processes, ranging from facilitating interactions between cells to maintaining cell stability. The extensively studied S-layer glycoprotein (SLG) of Haloferax volcanii, previously thought to be anchored via C-terminal intercalation into the membrane, was recently shown to be lipidated and to have its C-terminal segment removed in processes dependent upon archaeosortase A (ArtA), a recently discovered enzyme. While SLG is a Sec substrate, in silico analyses presented here reveal that, of eight additional ArtA substrates predicted, two substrates also contain predicted Tat signal peptides, including Hvo_0405, which has a highly conserved tripartite structure that lies closer to the center of the protein than to its C terminus, unlike other predicted ArtA substrates identified to date. We demonstrate that, even given its atypical location, this tripartite structure, which likely resulted from the fusion of genes encoding an ArtA substrate and a cytoplasmic protein, is processed in an ArtA-dependent manner. Using an Hvo_0405 mutant lacking the conserved twin arginines of the predicted Tat signal peptide, we show that Hvo_0405 is indeed a Tat substrate and that ArtA substrates include both Sec and Tat substrates. Finally, we confirmed the Tat-dependent localization and signal peptidase I (SPase I) cleavage site of Hvo_0405 using mass spectrometry. IMPORTANCE The specific mechanisms that facilitate protein anchoring to the archaeal cell surface remain poorly understood. Here, we have shown that the proteins bound to the cell surface of the model archaeon H. volcanii, through a recently discovered novel ArtA-dependent anchoring mechanism, are more structurally diverse than was previously known. Specifically, our results demonstrate that both Tat and Sec substrates, which contain the conserved tripartite structure of predicted ArtA substrates, can be processed in an ArtA-dependent manner and that the tripartite structure need not lie near the C terminus for this processing to occur. These data improve our understanding of archaeal cell biology and are invaluable for in silico subcellular localization predictions of archaeal and bacterial proteins.	6.1
Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes severe liver disease and affects ca. 146 million individuals. Novel directly acting antivirals targeting HCV have revolutionized treatment. However, high costs limit access to therapy. Recently, several related drugs used in humans to treat allergies or as neuroleptics emerged as potent HCV cell entry inhibitors. Insights into their antiviral modes of action may increase opportunities for drug repurposing in hepatitis C and possibly other important human viral infections.	5.1
Infants begin to help other individuals in the second year of life. However, it is still unclear whether early helping behavior is based on an understanding of other individuals' needs and is thus motivated prosocially. In the present eye-tracking study, 9- to 18-month-old infants (N = 71) saw a character in need of help, unable to reach its goal because of an obstacle, and a second character that was able to achieve a goal on its own. When a third individual (a helper) initiated an action, the infants expected the helper to help the character in need (as indicated during the anticipatory-looking and violation-of-expectation phases). Their prosocial understanding did not differ between age groups and was not related to their helping behavior (measured in two behavioral tasks). Thus, infants understand other individuals' needs even before they start to help others themselves. This indicates that early helping may indeed be motivated prosocially and raises the question of which other competences underlie the ontogeny of helping behavior.	2.4
Preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid deposition in the absence of overt clinical impairment. There is substantial heterogeneity in the long-term clinical outcomes among amyloid positive individuals, yet limited work has focused on identifying molecular factors driving resilience from amyloid-related cognitive impairment. We apply a recently developed predicted gene expression analysis (PrediXcan) to identify genes that modify the association between baseline amyloid deposition and longitudinal cognitive changes. Participants free of clinical AD (n = 631) were selected from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who had a baseline positron emission tomography measure of amyloid deposition (quantified as a standard uptake value ratio), longitudinal neuropsychological data, and genetic data. PrediXcan was used to impute gene expression levels across 15 heart and brain tissues. Mixed effect regression models assessed the interaction between predicted gene expression levels and amyloid deposition on longitudinal cognitive outcomes. The predicted gene expression levels for two genes in the coronary artery (CNTLN, PROK1) and two genes in the atrial appendage (PRSS50, PROK1) interacted with amyloid deposition on episodic memory performance. The predicted gene expression levels for two additional genes (TMC4 in the basal ganglia and HMBS in the aorta) interacted with amyloid deposition on executive function performance. Post-hoc analyses provide additional validation of the HMBS and PROK1 effects across two independent subsets of ADNI using two additional metrics of amyloid deposition. These results highlight a subset of unique candidate genes of resilience and provide evidence that cell-cycle regulation, angiogenesis, and heme biosynthesis likely play a role in AD progression.	5.2
Removing geometric details from the computational domain can significantly reduce the complexity of downstream task of meshing and simulation computation, and increase their stability. Proper estimation of the sensitivity analysis error induced by removing such domain details, called defeaturing errors, can ensure that the sensitivity analysis fidelity can still be met after simplification. In this paper, estimation of impacts of removing arbitrarily constrained domain details to the analysis of incompressible fluid flows is studied with applications to fast analysis of incompressible fluid flows in complex environments. The derived error estimator is applicable to geometric details constrained by either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, and has no special requirements on the outer boundary conditions. Extensive numerical examples were presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed error estimator.	3.4
Mesh denoising is imperative for improving imperfect surfaces acquired by scanning devices. The main challenge is to faithfully retain geometric features and avoid introducing additional artifacts when removing noise. Unlike the existing mesh denoising techniques that focus only on either the first-order features or high-order differential properties, our approach exploits the synergy when facet normals and quadric surfaces are integrated to recover a piecewise smooth surface. In specific, we vote on surface normal tensors from robust statistics to guide the creation of consistent subneighborhoods subsequently used by moving least squares (MLS). This voting naturally leads to a conceptually simple way that gives a unified mesh-denoising framework for not only handling noise but also enabling the recovering of surfaces with both sharp and small-scale features. The effectiveness of our framework stems from: 1) the multiscale tensor voting that avoids the influence from noise; 2) the effective energy minimization strategy to searching the consistent subneighborhoods; and 3) the piecewise MLS that fully prevents the side effects from different subneighborhoods during surface fitting. Our framework is direct, practical, and easy to understand. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate its outstanding performance on feature preservation and artifact suppression. Note to Practitioners-Three-dimensional sensing and scanning devices are widely used to capture digital surfaces of real objects and scenes in many scenarios. However, due to occlusion, motion, multiple reflections, and so on, the captured data often suffer from severe contamination with noise, significantly hindering its practical applications. Therefore, it is indispensable to remove noise prior to further processing, which is commonly referred to as mesh denoising. Mesh denoising is a long-standing problem, and remains open in academic as well as industrial applications due to its challenging nature. The state-of-the-art methods either fail to retain most of the original features presented well in the object, or cannot avoid additional artifacts, such as vertex drifts. In contrast, we design a denoising framework aiming at improving the quality of the raw surface by producing a mesh with better perceptual features. The technique developed here can produce high-quality surface data of real objects and scenes, which would facilitate the modeling, reconstruction, and recognition applications in computer-aided design, reverse engineering, 3-D printing, and computer-aided manufacturing.	3.0
Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as a persuasive technology for attitude and behavior change. This paper considers Terror Management Theory (TMT), one of the notable theories that have not been considered so far in persuasive technology, and aims at exploring its use in VR experiences. First, we show that a 'VR experience can be used to effectively elicit mortality salience (MS), which makes TMT applicable. Then, we evaluate the effects of the VR experience on attitudes towards risk. Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), participants explored one of two virtual environments (VEs). In a first group of participants, the VE represented a cemetery with MS cues like tombs and burial recesses. In a second group of participants, the MS cues were removed, and the VE looked like a public park. Results show that the MS cues manipulation changed the effects of the VR experience on users' attitudes towards risk, as TMT would predict. Moreover, results revealed a relationship between MS elicited through VR and physiological correlates of arousal. Finally, we show that user's personality traits can moderate the effects of the VR experience on attitudes towards risk.	2.4
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent a new revolutionary weapon in the armamentarium of anti-cancer therapies. The side effects of these new agents represent a new challenge for oncologists; they are usually unpredictable and sometimes life threatening, if not managed rapidly and adequately. The most frequent side effects are the dermatologic, but they are usually low grade side effects and consequently easily manageable. Rash, pruritus and vitiligo are the most frequent dermatologic side effects. We aimed in this review to describe first all the dermatologic side effects of ICI according to the subtype of ICI and combination therapies in the clinical trials, then to report all the rare case reports dermatologic side effects, and finally to present the management algorithm of these side effects.	6.3
Two key issues in landslide forecasting are finding the critical slip surface and determining its parameters. Generally, these issues are two parts of one problem. To solve this problem, a new two-phase search method is proposed: a newly proposed inversion method to determine the critical slip surface parameters, using a new bionics algorithm (i.e., particle swarm optimization), and based on the measured slip surface and the critical slip surface-searching process. The proposed method is verified by using two typical numerical examples used by the Association for Computer Aided Design (Australia) and an engineering example of a highway landslide. The results indicate that when the search over a critical slip surface and the inversion of its parameters are performed simultaneously, the calculated factor of safety is in good agreement with that of the actual scenario, whereas the factor of safety computed on the basis of known parameters of a slide body will deviate from that of the physical scenario.	3.0
Iron deficiency continues to be the most prevalent micronutrient deficit worldwide. Since iron is involved in several processes including myelination, dopamine neurotransmission and neuronal metabolism, the presence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in infancy relates to long-lasting neurofunctional effects. There is scarce data regarding whether these effects would extend to former iron deficient anemic human adults. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a novel technique to explore patterns of functional connectivity. Default Mode Network (DMN), one of the resting state networks, is deeply involved in memory, social cognition and self-referential processes. The four core regions consistently identified in the DMN are the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and left and right inferior parietal cortex. Therefore to investigate the DMN in former iron deficient anemic adults is a particularly useful approach to elucidate de long term effects on functional brain. We conducted this research to explore the connection between IDA in infancy and altered patterns of resting state brain functional networks in young adults. Resting-state fMRI studies were performed to 31 participants that belong to a follow-up study since infancy. Of them, 14 participants were former iron deficient anemic in infancy and 17 were controls, with mean age of 21.5 years (+/- 1.5) and 54.8% were males. Resting-state fMRI protocol was used and the data was analyzed using the seed based connectivity statistical analysis to assess the DMN. We found that compared to controls, former iron deficient anemic subjects showed posterior DMN decreased connectivity to the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), whereas they exhibited increased anterior DMN connectivity to the right PCC. Differences between groups were also apparent in the left medial frontal gyrus, with former iron deficient anemic participants having increased connectivity with areas included in DMN and dorsal attention networks. These preliminary results suggest different patterns of functional connectivity between former iron deficient anemic and control young adults. Indeed, IDA in infancy, a common nutritional problem among human infants, may turn out to be important for understanding the mechanisms of cognitive alterations, common in adulthood.	2.1
Children with autism have atypical gaze behavior but it is unknown whether gaze differs during distinct types of reciprocal interactions. Typically developing children (N = 20) and children with autism (N = 20) (4-13 years) made similar amounts of eye contact with an examiner during a conversation. Surprisingly, there was minimal eye contact during interactive play in both groups. Gaze behavior was stable across 8 weeks in children with autism (N = 15). Lastly, gaze behavior during conversation but not play was associated with autism social affect severity scores (ADOS CSS SA) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2). Together findings suggests that eye contact in typical and atypical development is influenced by subtle changes in context, which has implications for optimizing assessments of social communication skills.	2.3
With rapid development of mobile technologies, people can easily obtain surrounding information through their mobile devices. Meanwhile, weather forecasting information is important for many people in the daily life. Most of current weather information systems only illustrate the basic weather information, such as the temperature and the precipitation probability, by a simple text-based or graphic-based presentation without involving too much environmental information. To integrate weather information with ambient intelligence, this paper aims at showing our implementation experience about how to realize our ambient mesoscale weather forecasting system (AMWFS). With an augmented reality presentation in the system, a more intuitive navigation interface provides users a new way of accessing weather information.	4.0
Since the end of the 1990s, rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been growing in France. A first regulatory framework, constituted mainly by an Order of 21 August, 2008, helped to strengthen this practice, but also introduced some limitations to the development of RWH. Considering the growing social demand and possible issues for water resources, it is likely that this first regulatory framework will evolve. In order to anticipate these changes, foreign case studies may be very instructive. Based on a detailed analysis of eight countries in all continents (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, Australia and Uganda), this paper draws up an international overview of RWH allowing French practices to be put into perspective. Beyond the specific and sensitive differences, the experience of these countries gives useful lessons for the French case. Comparisons have been drawn on different topics: uses of rainwater, quality standards, regulatory tools and RWH development factors. RWH, especially, in urban areas appears in France as an isolated topic. It is necessary in the future to better integrate it into overall urban water management approaches.	4.3
Purpose of Review Echocardiography is the mainstay in the diagnostic evaluation of constrictive pericarditis (CP) and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), but no single echocardiographic parameter is sufficiently robust to accurately distinguish between the two conditions. The present review summarizes the recent advances in echocardiography that promise to improve its diagnostic performance for this purpose. The role of other imaging modalities such as cardiac computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and invasive hemodynamic assessment in the overall diagnostic approach is also discussed briefly. Recent Findings A recent study has demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography with integration of multiple conventional echocardiographic parameters in to a step-wise algorithm. Concurrently, the studies using speckle-tracking echocardiography have revealed distinct and disparate patterns of myocardial mechanical abnormalities in CP and RCM with their ability to distinguish between the two conditions. The incorporation of machine-learning algorithms into echocardiography workflow permits easy integration of the wealth of the diagnostic data available and promises to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography. Summary New imaging algorithms are continuously being evolved to permit accurate distinction between CP and RCM. Further research is needed to validate the accuracy of these newer algorithms and to define their place in the overall diagnostic approach for this purpose.	0.1
Williams Syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder associated with a hemideletion in chromosome 7, which manifests a distinct behavioral phenotype characterized by a hyperaffiliative social drive, in striking contrast to the social avoidance behaviors that are common in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). MRI studies have observed structural and functional abnormalities in WS cortex, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region implicated in social cognition. This study utilizes the Bellugi Williams Syndrome Brain Collection, a unique resource that comprises the largest WS postmortem brain collection in existence, and is the first to quantitatively examine WS PFC cytoarchitecture. We measured neuron density in layers II/III and V/VI of five cortical areas: PFC areas BA 10 and BA 11, primary motor BA 4, primary somatosensory BA 3, and visual area BA 18 in six matched pairs of WS and typically developing (TD) controls. Neuron density in PFC was lower in WS relative to TD, with layers V/VI demonstrating the largest decrease in density, reaching statistical significance in BA 10. In contrast, BA 3 and BA 18 demonstrated a higher density in WS compared to TD, although this difference was not statistically significant. Neuron density in BA 4 was similar in WS and TD. While other cortical areas were altered in WS, prefrontal areas appeared to be most affected. Neuron density is also altered in the PFC of individuals with ASD. Together these findings suggest that the PFC is targeted in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with sociobehavioral alterations. Autism Res2017, 10: 99-112.

This paper examines the water depth variations of vertical slot fishways (VSFs) without central baffle. Three experimental models are built for the research. The results show that: the adjoining pools should have the same fore-and-aft elevation difference to prevent obvious fluctuation of water depth. Instead of being uniform along the fishway, the water depth is affected by upstream and downstream water levels. The fluctuations of the water levels exert an impact to over a dozen pools at the end of the fishway. The water line characteristics are different when the downstream water depth is greater or smaller than the normal conditions. Under the working condition of backwater, the water depth increases uniformly in pools in the backwater section; under the condition of drawdown, the depth falls faster in the pools closer to the end of the fishway. Two flow profiles are obtained from the VFS: the Ml and M2, which are analyzed by the Bakhmeteff-Chow method. These findings help enhance the understanding of the hydraulic design of the fishway, and improve efficiency of the VSFs.	3.1
Rationale: High intelligence may be associated with emotional, behavioral and social difficulties. However, this hypothesis is supported by little compelling, population-based evidence, and no study has been conducted during the preschool period with a population-based sample. Method: Children (N = 1100) from the EDEN mother-child cohort were assessed at the age of 5-6 years. Behavioral, emotional and social problems (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior) were measured using the parent-rated Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ). IQ scores were based on the WPPSI-III at 5-6 years. Relevant covariates for children's cognitive development were also collected. Results: We found no significant differences in SDQscores between gifted children (N = 23; Full Scale IQ >130) and children with Full Scale IQin the normal range (N = 1058 >= 70 and <= 130), except a marginally significant association between high-IQ and emotional difficulties at 5-6 years. Further sensitivity analyses did not support the association between high-nand emotional difficulties. Discussion: During the preschool period, gifted children do not seem to manifest more behavioral, emotional and social problems than children with normal IQ. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Imagination pushes humanity well beyond its natural biological capacities. An approach of co-evolution, between molecular biology and behaviour, is thus required to explain these combined processes. Technological performances define spiritual conquests and formulas whose sole function is cultural. Humanity operates according to intentional social modes defined by the group, but these immediately become conditions for their own evolution. These choices are the motor for the history of humanity, and thus humanity can itself choose its own path. Anatomic modernisation is only a distant reflection of bipedalism, but freeing the hands leads to the development of abstract thought. The relationship between anatomy and awareness allows infinite variations in the harmonious adaptation to nature, animals and other societies. In Europe, humanity arrived in abrupt bursts because it was the result of external evolution, continuous and distant, dispersed across Asia. By its unceasing audacity, humanity combats biological determinism, imposing moral rules, or imperatives. The balance between biology and culture is reflected in the rules for sharing food: the biological life itself is coded by social sharing. These systems take on ternary values as soon as they include animal behaviours. Built shelters integrate societies with the cosmos because they delimit cultural spaces within natural chaos. Mastery of cognitive mechanisms gives humanity an entirely new responsibility, that of being able to define its destiny. Our united disciplines are transformed into ethical requirements.

The recent TAU computer-aided design (CAD) contest has aimed to seek novel ideas for accurate and fast common path pessimism removal (CPPR). Unnecessary pessimism forces the static timing analysis tool to report worse violation than the true timing properties owned by physical circuits, thereby misleading signoff timing into a lower clock frequency at which circuits can operate than actual silicon implementations. Therefore, we introduce in this paper UI-Timer 1.0, a powerful CPPR algorithm which achieves high accuracy and ultrafast runtime. Unlike existing approaches which are dominated by explicit path search, UI-Timer 1.0 proves that by implicit path representation the amount of search effort can be significantly reduced. Our timer is superior in both space and time saving, from which memory storage and important timing quantities are available in constant space and constant time per path during the search. Experimental results on industrial benchmarks released from TAU 2014 CAD contest have justified that UI-Timer 1.0 achieved the best result in terms of accuracy and runtime over existing CPPR algorithms.	3.0
According to the Social Message Model, interpersonal judgments are transactions in which judges convey important social messages to the individuals they evaluate (the targets); targets can then respond to the judgments in more or less adaptive ways. We argue that judges' opinions emerge from their current concerns, be it to promote their own well-being, or to foster group cohesion. Targets of judgments can best interpret the meaning of a judgment they receive by understanding the judge's concerns, competence of the judge, and other qualities of the transaction. We suggest that judges and targets who are better able to reason about the judgment process are likely to change their behaviors more adaptively than people less able to reason in this area.	2.2
This study assesses two approaches to combine observations from active and passive satellite microwave instruments in a soil moisture data assimilation system. In the first approach, labeled 'joint retrieval assimilation', a single soil moisture product is simultaneously retrieved from active and passive microwave observations, and then assimilated into the NASA Catchment land surface model. In the second approach, labeled 'separate retrieval assimilation', separate soil moisture products are retrieved from each of the active and passive microwave observations, before being simultaneously assimilated into the model. In both approaches, a Neural Network (NN) is used to retrieve soil moisture from passive microwave AMSR-E brightness temperatures and/or active microwave ASCAT backscatter observations. A spatially distributed (3D) ensemble Kalman filter is used for the assimilation over the contiguous United States from August 2007 until September 2011. The analysis skill of both assimilation approaches is evaluated against in situ observations from 60 SCAN stations and compared to the model open loop (no assimilation) skill. When averaged across the 60 sites, the skill obtained from both assimilation experiments is very similar. For surface soil moisture, the average correlation and anomaly correlation are 0.69 and 0.58, respectively. These metrics are slightly better than those of the open loop, by 0.05 for the correlation and by 0.03 for the anomaly correlation. The root zone soil moisture estimates from the assimilation were also slightly improved compared to the open loop (by 0.03 for the average correlation and by 0.01 for the average anomaly correlation). Locally, there are differences between the skill values of the two assimilation experiments. These are related to differences in the skill of the assimilated retrieval products and how well these differences are captured by the observation errors specified in the data assimilation.

Social isolation is a major source of stress and can lead to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The presence of a close social partner can reduce the magnitude of the HPA-axis response during a stressor, a phenomenon known as social buffering. The oxytocin (OXT) system has been identified as one candidate for mediating social buffering due to its role in the facilitation of social bonding and the expression of prosocial behavior. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the OXT system contributes to social buffering of HPA-axis activity in response to stressor exposure in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Male and female marmosets experienced a standardized psychogenic stressor with and without their long-term mate under OXT-treatments (Pro(8)-OXT, Leu(8)-OXT, OXT antagonist, and saline); we assessed HPA-axis activity by measuring urinary cortisol across the stressor. We found that blocking, but not augmenting, the OXT system altered patterns of cortisol and proximity behavior in response to a stressor. We demonstrated that (1) the presence of a mate during a stressor significantly attenuated HPA-axis activity in female, but not male, marmosets; (2) male, but not female, marmosets treated with an OXT antagonist had significantly higher HPA-axis activity across the stressor than when they were treated with saline, suggesting that the OXT system may reduce the stressor-induced rise in cortisol levels; (3) male and female marmosets treated with an OXT antagonist spent significantly less time in close proximity to their mate during the first 30 min of the stressor than when they were treated with saline, suggesting that the OXT system may be important for the expression of partner-seeking behavior during a stressor. Thus, the OXT system and social context differentially influenced how the HPA-axis responded to a stressor in male and female marmosets, and may modulate HPA-axis activity by promoting the expression of proximity behavior with a close social partner.

In heterosexual individuals, attention is automatically captured by physically attractive members of the opposite sex. Although helpful for selecting new mates, attention to attractive relationship alternatives can threaten satisfaction with and commitment to an existing romantic relationship. The current study tested the hypothesis that although a mating prime would increase selective attention to attractive opposite-sex targets (relative to less attractive targets) among single participants, this effect would be reduced among people already committed to a long-term romantic partner. Consistent with hypotheses, whereas single participants responded to a mating prime with greater attentional adhesion to physically attractive opposite-sex targets (relative to less attractive targets), participants in a committed romantic relationship showed no such effect. These findings extend previous research suggesting the presence of relationship maintenance mechanisms that operate at early stages of social cognition.	2.1
In the last decade, the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix has risen significantly in many countries, and the large-scale integration of these intermittent energy sources constitutes a major challenge to the power grid. A crucial building block of a successful transformation of today's energy systems is the use of energy storage, either co-located with renewable energy sources or on a grid-level. To this end, we present a model on the basis of a Markov Decision Process for the short-term trading of intermittent energy production co-located with energy storage. The model explicitly considers the time lag between trade and delivery of energy, which is characteristic for energy markets. Our storage representation includes asymmetrical conversion losses, asymmetrical power, and self-discharge. Stochastic production and market prices are represented by ARIMA processes, and the producer may also undertake price arbitrage by purchasing energy on the market when prices are comparatively low. Regarding the solution of our model, we develop several intuitive and easily interpretable decision rules that can be readily applied in practice. An extensive numerical study, based on real-world data, confirms the excellent performance of these rules in comparison to a sophisticated Approximate Dynamic Programming algorithm adapted from literature.

Primary objective: There is considerable evidence suggesting facial affect recognition and cognitive functions are impaired in many people with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, little is known about the relationship between these two domains in the TBI population. Research design: This study investigated the relationship between facial affect recognition and cognitive functioning in 75 adults with moderate-to-severe TBI. Methods and procedures: Participants were administered three facial affect recognition tests and a computerized cognitive test battery that assessed seven cognitive domains. Main outcomes and results: Deficits in facial affect recognition were significantly correlated with impairments in non-verbal memory, working memory, speed of processing, verbal memory and verbal delayed memory. No significant relationship was found between executive dysfunction and facial affect recognition impairments. Non-verbal memory, working memory and speed of processing significantly predicted overall facial affect recognition performance. Conclusions: It is concluded that impairment in several cognitive processes may contribute to facial affect recognition deficits in TBI, in particular non-verbal memory, working memory and speed of processing. Furthermore, executive functioning may not be a critical factor in facial affect recognition, but would most likely be important in deciding what to do once facial affect is perceived.	2.3
A long-term goal of our field is to determine the sequence of pathological events, which ultimately lead to cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation (measured with the positron emission tomography tracer F-18-AV-1451) associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. We then explored highly associated patterns of greater F-18-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloid-beta plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. We found that: (i) F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age, and cross-sectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention, but not with years of education, gender, or APOE genotype; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, in the parieto-temporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater F-18-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir positive/negative-associated variability; and (iii) this F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-beta plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, non-local associations linking increased amyloid-beta accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloid-beta pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks.	5.2
A series of neurological and psychiatric symptoms occur after traumatic brain injury (TBI), with cognitive dysfunction being one of the most prominent sequela. Given that tau hyperphosphorylation is an important cause of cognitive impairment in patients of Alzheimer's disease, our present study detected the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), mainly at Ser404, in multiple brain regions, including the ipsilateral parietal cortex, contralateral hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, immediately after the injury in a mouse TBI model; these changes lasted for at least 4w. All of these brain regions play important roles in working memory. Hyperphosphorylated tau protein was primarily located in neurons and was accompanied by axonal injury and dendritic spine degeneration. Our study demonstrated that p-tau spreads gradually and selectively from the injured cortex to other brain regions after TBI and that all of the affected regions are part of the working memory circuit. These findings provide experimental support for the role of p-tau in cognitive impairment in the early phase after TBI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	5.2
Understanding how historical and current environmental suitability and human impacts affect the genetic diversity on a large scale is essential to species management planning. However, most studies in conservation genetics are carried out at a local or regional scale and rarely on broad spatial scales such as an entire biome. We evaluated the relative contribution of historical and current environmental suitability, current landscape features and human impacts to explain genetic diversity, allelic richness and inbreeding variation among populations, using Euterpe edulis and the Atlantic forest as the model system. We fitted linear mixed models within a multiple competing hypotheses approach with model selection based on Akaike's Information Criteria. We showed that overall genetic diversity was lower in sites with absence of large seed dispersers and higher in sites with historically stable climate. Both seedling and adults showed to be negatively influenced by human impact factors; with adults mainly affected by the reduction of forest cover while seedlings by the loss of large seed dispersers. Thus, the current pattern of genetic diversity in E. edulis is the result of historical instability during the mid-Holocene and recent anthropogenic impacts, mainly those that affect important ecological process such as seed dispersal. Thus, an efficient plan for species conservation must account for human impacts and environmental suitability and also assess the genetic diversity of seedlings and adults in fragmented landscapes.	6.4
Parliamentary websites have become one of the most important windows for citizens and media to follow the activities of their legislatures and to hold parliaments to account. Therefore, most parliamentary institutions aim to provide new multimedia solutions capable of displaying video fragments on demand on plenary activities. This paper presents a multimedia system for parliamentary institutions to produce video fragments on demand through a website with linked information and public feedback that helps to explain the content shown in these fragments. A prototype implementation has been developed for the Canary Islands Parliament (Spain) and shows how traditional parliamentary streaming systems can be enhanced by the use of semantics and computer vision for video analytics. The semantic web technologies used make search capabilities on parliamentary websites available to users to retrieve video fragments on demand with accurate and timely information. In addition, video analytic techniques enable the automation of identifying representative keyframes to be annotated by parliamentary experts. As a result, parliaments are able to enhance citizens' access to information and ensure that these institutions are more open andaccountable on their websites and; at the same time, the labor-intensive tasks of parliamentary experts are considerably reduced.	0.0
We consider free surface flow over two localised obstacles using the framework of the forced Korteweg de Vries equation in a suite of numerical simulations. Our main concern is with the transcritical regime when the oncoming flow has a Froude number close to unity. The flow behaviour can be characterised by the Froude number and the maximum heights of the obstacles. In the transcritical regime at early times, undular bores are produced upstream and downstream of each obstacle. Our main aim is to describe the interaction of these undular bores between the obstacles, and to find the outcome at very large times. We find that the flow development can be defined in three stages. The first stage is described by the well-known development of undular bores upstream and downstream of each obstacle, 'file second stage is the interaction between the undular bore moving downstream from the first obstacle and the undular bore moving upstream from the second obstacle. The third stage is the very large time evolution of this interaction, when one of the obstacles controls criticality. For equal obstacle heights, our analytical and numerical results indicate that either one of the obstacles can control flow criticality, that being the first obstacle when the flow is slightly suhcritical and the second obstacle otherwise. For unequal obstacle heights the larger obstacle controls criticality. 'fhe results obtained here complement a recent numerical study using the fully nonlinear, but non-dispersive, shallow water equations.	3.1
Introduction: Relationship perception focuses on social interactions, is reduced in schizophrenia and is related to daily functioning. It can be assessed with the Relationships Across Domains (RAD) test, built on Relational Models Theory which states that people use four relational models to interpret social interaction. RAD is time consuming, low on tolerability and only used in English-speaking countries. We evaluated the psychometric properties of a translated, abbreviated Norwegian version.Methods: Sixty-two schizophrenia participants and 56 healthy controls underwent assessments of social and non-social cognition. The schizophrenia group completed functional and clinical measures. RAD's internal consistency was investigated with Cronbach's alphas, group differences with logistic regressions and associations between study variables with Pearson's correlations.Results: RAD was reduced from 25 (Cronbach's alpha=.809) to 12 vignettes (Cronbach's alpha=.815). Schizophrenia participants had significant impairments, with larger effect sizes for the full version. Associations of RAD with study variables were similar for the two versions: smaller for clinical measures and larger for functional and cognitive measures. Results were comparable to results for the English version.Conclusions: The length of the Norwegian RAD was reduced while retaining its psychometric properties, which were similar to the English version. This suggests the test's cross-cultural utility.	2.1
An accurate analysis of the flow transient is very important in safety evaluation of a nuclear power plant. In this study, analysis of a VVVVER-1000 reactor is investigated. In order to perform this analysis, a model is developed to simulate the coupled kinetics and thermal-hydraulics of the reactor with a simple and accurate numerical algorithm. For thermal-hydraulic calculations, the four-equation drift-flux model is applied. Based on a multi-channel approach, core is divided into some regions. Each region has different characteristics as represented in a single fuel pin with its associated coolant channel. To obtain the core power distribution, point kinetic equations with different feedback effects are utilized. The appropriate initial and boundary conditions are considered and two situations of decreasing the coolant flow rate in a protected and unprotected core are analyzed. In addition to analysis of normal operation condition, a full range of thermal-hydraulic parameters is obtained for transients too. Finally, the data obtained from the model are compared with the calculations conducted using RELAP5/MOD3 code and Bushehr nuclear power plant data. It is shown that the model can provide accurate predictions for both steady-state and transient conditions.	3.1
Purpose: Little is known regarding the therapeutic role of exercise against the risk of a high-fat diet (HFD) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-like cognitive deficits. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of treadmill running against HFD-induced progression in AD neuropathology and cognitive impairments in the tripletransgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice. Methods: The 3xTg-AD mice were assigned to a chow diet (control, n = 10), an HFD (n = 10), or an HFD combined with exercise (HFD + EX, n = 10) group. Mice in the HFD were fed with a 60% fat diet for 20 wk. The HFD + EX mice were additionally subjected to treadmill running. Results: Compared with the control mice, the HFD mice had impaired brain insulin signaling, exacerbated AD neuropathology, defects in synaptic stability/plasticity, and apoptotic neuronal cell death in conjunction with exacerbated cognitive deficits in the affected brain regions, which were all significantly alleviated in the HFD + EX mice. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that treadmill running protects against AD-like disease progression and cognitive deficits caused by an HFD in the 3xTg-AD mice.	5.2
Probing interactions of biological systems at the molecular level is of great importance to fundamental biology, diagnosis, and drug discovery. A rational bioassay design of lithographically integrating individual point scattering sites into electrical circuits is capable of realizing real-time, label-free biodetection of influenza H1N1 viruses with single-molecule sensitivity and high selectivity by using silicon nanowires as local reporters in combination with microfluidics. This nanocircuit-based architecture is complementary to more conventional optical techniques, but has the advantages of no bleaching problems and no fluorescent labeling. These advantages offer a promising platform for exploring dynamics of stochastic processes in biological systems and gaining information from genomics to proteomics to improve accurate molecular and even point-of-care clinical diagnosis.	1.2
Purpose of review This review seeks to describe the role of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) in modulating non-HDL lipoprotein levels, platelet numbers and atherosclerosis. Recent findings Genetics studies have revealed that ASGR haplodeficiency provides protection from atherosclerosis. The potential interactions of ASGR with LDL receptor may regulate the rate of LDL uptake and as a result may lower plasma non-HDL cholesterol. ASGR clears senescent platelets and induces the expression of hepatic thrombopoietin. Platelet activity promotes plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Summary ASGR is a multifunctional receptor specializing in clearance of desialylated glycoproteins and platelets. The impact of ASGR on the levels of plasma non-HDL cholesterol makes it a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.	6.4

Many vital interdependent cellular functions including proteostasis, lipogenesis and Ca2+ homeostasis are executed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Exogenous insults can impair ER performance: this must be rapidly corrected or cell death will ensue. Protective adaptations can boost the functional capacity of the ER and form the basis of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Activated in response to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, the UPR can halt protein translation while increasing proteinhandling chaperones and the degradation of erroneous proteins through a conserved three-tier molecular cascade. However, prolonged activation of the UPR can result in the maladaptation of the system, resulting in the activation of inflammatory and apoptotic effectors. Recently, UPR and its involvement in neurodegenerative disease has attracted much interest and numerous potentially 'drugable' points of crosstalk are now emerging. Here, we summarize the functions of the ER and UPR, and highlight evidence for its potential role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, before discussing several key targets with therapeutic potential.

The heavy agricultural equipments cause high compaction in the top layer of the soil in agriculture. As the present method of soil compaction measurement is not ergonomically good practice by hand-held penetrometers either by static or dynamic. In India, the compaction data are taken by hand operated penetrometers generally which has certain limitations and more chance of error as manually operated penetrometers with dial gauge or digital display type penetrometers. However, some of the developed countries are using automatic multi-probe type sensor for collecting data for soil penetration resistance. Due to the limitations in hand held penetrometers, a tractor operated sensor based soil compaction measurement device has been developed which will increases the volume of data for a particular area and reduce human factor of error and upgrade the quality of measurement used by Indian scientific community for agricultural soil compaction so that scientists can correlate the crop parameters to be grown and this data can be used in agricultural machine design with different crop parameters and hence, recommendations for a particular machinery for a particular area or crop can be generated. Soil compactness and soil moisture content maps will give a colour coded maps of an area/particular region so that specific crop or the area needs attention on priority basis.	3.3
Using a person perception paradigm, two studies explored the interplay between target males' sociability and competence (the big two personality dimensions), gender role, and sexual orientation. Study 1 (N = 180) showed that sociable men were considered more likely to be gay than were competent men, which was mediated by the attribution of lower masculinity. In Study 2 (N = 120), target sexual orientation was considered as an independent variable. In the stereotype-congruent condition (gay/sociable vs. heterosexual/competent), gay men were rated more feminine and less masculine than were heterosexual men, whereas in the stereotype-incongruent condition (gay/competent vs. heterosexual/sociable), gay targets were rated less feminine but only equally masculine. Across both studies, the apparent stereotype of the nice gay guy was uncorrelated with participants' attitudes toward or contact with gay men. Results are discussed with regard to the gender-inversion hypothesis, the distinction between (anti) gay stereotypes and prejudice, and the stereotype content model.	2.0
Cell-based extracorporeal liver support is an option to assist or replace the failing organ until regeneration or until transplantation can be performed. The use of porcine cells or tumor cell lines is controversial. Primary human liver cells, obtained from explanted organs found to be unsuitable for transplantation, are a desirable cell source as they perform human metabolism and regulation. The Modular Extracorporeal. Liver Support (MELS) concept combines different extracorporeal therapy units, tailored to suit the individual and intra-individual clinical needs of the patient. A multi-compartment bioreactor (CellModule) is loaded with human liver cells obtained by 5-step collagenase liver perfusion. A cell mass of 400 g - 600 g enables the clinical application of a liver lobe equivalent hybrid organ. A detoxification module enables single pass albumin-dialysis via a standard high-flux dialysis filter, and continuous venovenuous hemodiafiltration may be included if required. Cells from 54 human livers have been isolated (donor age: 56 +/- 13 years, liver weight: 1862 +/- 556 g resulting in a viability of 55.0 +/- 15.9%). These grafts were not suitable for LTx, due to steatosis (54%), cirrhosis (15%), fibrosis (9%), and other reasons (22%). Out of 36 prepared bioreactors, 10 were clinically used to treat 8 patients with liver failure. The overall treatment time was 7-144 hours. No adverse events were observed. Initial clinical applications of the bioreactor evidenced the technical feasibility and safety of the system.	6.2
Cloud computing is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in servers on the Internet and cached temporarily on clients. Virtual private network (VPN) is the most widely used technology for secure cloud access. Unfortunately, VPN-based cloud services become unavailable when a VPN failure occurs. In this paper, we propose a new scheme to improve the availability of VPN connections against such failures, called high-availability virtual communication (HAVC). Unlike most of the multipath transmission schemes in the literature, the proposed scheme is implemented by using a virtualization technique, and its protocol functions are independent of existing networks - potential clients are not required to modify their applications or operating systems. Simulation results show that the HAVC can not only tolerate VPN failures but also achieve high transmission performance.	0.4
This work explores the benefits of supporting learners affectively in a context-aware learning situation. This features a new challenge in related literature in terms of providing affective educational recommendations that take advantage of ambient intelligence and are delivered through actuators available in the environment, thus going beyond previous approaches which provided computer-based recommendation that present some text or tell aloud the learner what to do. To address this open issue, we have applied TORMES elicitation methodology, which has been used to investigate the potential of ambient intelligence for making more interactive recommendations in an emotionally challenging scenario (i.e. preparing for the oral examination of a second language learning course). Arduino open source electronics prototyping platform is used both to sense changes in the learners' affective state and to deliver the recommendation in a more interactive way through different complementary sensory communication channels (sight, hearing, touch) to cope with a universal design. An Ambient Intelligence Context-aware Affective Recommender Platform (AICARP) has been built to support the whole experience, which represents a progress in the state of the art. In particular, we have come up with what is most likely the first interactive context-aware affective educational recommendation. The value of this contribution lies in discussing methodological and practical issues involved.	4.0
Hyperspectral remote sensing data carry information on the leaf area index (LAI) of forests, and thus in principle, LAI can be estimated based on the data by inverting a forest reflectance model. However, LAI is usually not the only unknown in a reflectance model; especially, the leaf spectral albedo and understory reflectance are also not known. If the uncertainties of these parameters are not accounted for, the inversion of a forest reflectance model can lead to biased estimates for LAI. In this paper, we study the effects of reflectance model uncertainties on LAI estimates, and further, investigate whether the LAI estimates could recover from these uncertainties with the aid of Bayesian inference. In the proposed approach, the unknown leaf albedo and understory reflectance are estimated simultaneously with LAI from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The feasibility of the approach is tested with numerical simulation studies. The results show that in the presence of unknown parameters, the Bayesian LAI estimates which account for the model uncertainties outperform the conventional estimates that are based on biased model parameters. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the Bayesian inference can also provide feasible measures for the uncertainty of the estimated LAI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.2

d-Limonene has efficacy in preclinical models of breast cancer, causing >80% of carcinomas to regress with little host toxicity. We performed a pilot study on healthy human volunteers to identify plasma metabolites of limonene and to assess the toxicity of supradietary quan titles of d-limonene. Seven subjects ingested 100 mg/kg limonene in a custard. Blood was drawn at 0 and 24 h for chemistry-panel analysis and at 0, 4, and 24 h for limonene-metabolite analysis. On-line capillary gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis indicated that at least five compounds were present at 4 h that were not present at time zero. Two major peaks were identified as the rat limonene metabolites dihydroperillic acid and perillic acid, and two minor peaks were found to be the respective methyl esters of these acids. A third major peak was identified as limonene-1,2-diol. Limonene was a minor component. At a dose of 100 mg/kg, limonene caused no gradable toxicity. Limonene is metabolized by humans and rats in a similar manner. These observations and the high therapeutic ratio of limonene in the chemotherapy of rodent cancers suggest that limonene may be an efficacious chemotherapeutic agent for human malignancies.	6.2
Touch is a primary nonverbal communication channel used to communicate emotions or other social messages. Despite its importance, this channel is still very little explored in the affective computing field, as much more focus has been placed on visual and aural channels. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to automatically discriminate between different social touch types. We propose five distinct feature sets for describing touch behaviours captured by a grid of pressure sensors. These features are then combined together by using the Random Forest and Boosting methods for categorizing the touch gesture type. The proposed methods were evaluated on both the HAART (7 gesture types over different surfaces) and the CoST (14 gesture types over the same surface) datasets made available by the Social Touch Gesture Challenge 2015. Well above chance level performances were achieved with a 67% accuracy for the HAART and 59% for the CoST testing datasets respectively.	2.3
The global and UK drive for a low-carbon dioxide environment, as well as a secure and affordable energy supply, has encouraged nuclear power to play a core role in the UK energy mix: the UK landscape today houses eight large nuclear plants (15 reactors) reported to generate about 21% of UK electricity. By 2030, two-thirds of the UK's electricity generation capacity will have retired; it will need to be replaced with low-carbon dioxide and reliable power for the future to improve the UK's energy security and meet its commitments on carbon dioxide emissions targets. With 50% cumulative growth in nuclear capacity forecast between 2014 and 2035 (in comparison to coal at 10%, oil at 20% and gas at 44%) still leaving nuclear with only a 5% share of global capacity in 2035, there is considerable scope for nuclear in the long term.	1.0

A series of SiO2@aluminum-MOF(MIL-68) composites with different SiO2 loadings have been synthesized by a simple and mild compositing strategy for high-efficiency removal of aniline. As evidenced from SEM and TEM images as well as the particle size distribution, the incorporation of SiO2 can improve the dispersity of MIL-68(Al) in composites, and result in the smaller particle size than that of pristine MIL-68(Al). Besides, the adsorption of aniline over SiO2, MIL-68(Al), the physical mixture of these two materials, and SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites was investigated comparatively, demonstrating a relatively high adsorption capacity (531.9 mg g(-1)) of 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) towards aniline. Combining the ultrafast adsorption dynamics (reaching equilibrium within 40 s) and great reusability, 7% SiO2@MIL-68(Al) shows excellent adsorption performance. This indicates that the SiO2@MIL-68(Al) composites possess great potential applications as a kind of fascinating adsorbent in water pollution protection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Can the positivity bias, observed across various Social Network Sites (SNSs), predict the use of prosocial lies in a SNS such as Facebook? The positivity bias may be a product of politeness norms (i.e., positive face concern) that have influenced communication phenomena before these sites existed. In addition, positive face concern may also be affected by unconscious cues or primes that promote prosocial behavior on Facebook. We conducted an online experiment using current Facebook users to examine how positive face concern and surveillance primes affect prosocial lying in public and private Facebook contexts. Although positive face concern and publicness predicted the use of prosocial lying, positive face concern was not affected by the publicness and surveillance primes did not affect positive face concern or the use of prosocial lies in our study. This hints towards the nuance of positive face concern and the potential limitations of surveillance primes on prosocial lying behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	2.4
Our study used allozyme analyses to evaluate potential impacts of ecological restoration treatments on genetic diversity of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum) populations within the Fort Valley Experimental Forest near Flagstaff, AZ. Allele frequencies varied among pre-settlement clumps, with trees more closely related to each other within clumps. This clumpy spatial stand structure typical of reference conditions thus represents genetic neighborhoods and suggests restoration of clumpy versus more evenly dispersed trees in naturally regenerating stands will protect evolutionary genetic patterns. Compared to pre-settlement populations, post-settlement trees had slightly greater heterozygosity, and allelic richness and allele frequencies varied between these two age groups. These genetic differences could have resulted from different selective conditions under which the two age groups became established. Genetic diversity of populations created using different selection criteria for residual post-settlement trees did not vary but simulated removal of 75% of post-settlement trees decreased allelic richness. Maintaining more clumps created from post-settlement populations with higher tree densities across the landscape would be more effective at conserving allelic richness. Overall results of this study indicate use of genetic structure and diversity can help guide restoration treatments to help ensure adaptive potential is conserved.	6.4
Investigations utilizing recombinant human xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes as well as human hepatocytes have revealed a number of interactions not only between different environmental chemicals (ECs) but also between ECs and endogenous metabolites. Organophosphorus insecticides (OPs) are potent inhibitors of the human metabolism of carbaryl, carbofuran, DEET and fipronil, as well as the jet fuel components, nonane and naphthalene. OPs are potent irreversible inhibitors of testosterone metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and of estradiol metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. All of these CYP inhibitions are believed to be due to the release of reactive sulfur during CYP-catalyzed oxidative desulfuration. It has also been shown that the esterase(s) responsible for the initial step in permethrin metabolism in human liver is inhibited by both chlorpyrifos oxon and carbaryl. A number of pesticides, including chlorpyrifos, fipronil and permethrin, and the repellent, DEET, have been shown to be inducers of CYP isoforms in human hepatocytes, with fipronil being the most potent. Several agrochemicals, including fipronil and the pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin, show toxicity toward human hepatocytes with fipronil being the most potent in this regard. Endosulfan-alpha, which has shown promise as a model substrate for phenotyping CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in human liver microsomes, is also an inducer of CYP2B6, acting through the PXR receptor.

Feeding interactions among functional feeding groups (FFGs) of macroinvertebrates are robust indicators of aquatic ecosystem interactions. They provide information regarding organic matter processing, habitat condition and trophic dynamics. In tropical rivers with pronounced wet and dry seasons, macroinvertebrate based ecological monitoring tools are explicitly focused on metrics and indices, while ignoring interactions of FFG5. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the functional feeding type metrics, diversity indices and feeding interactions among FFG5 of macroinvertebrates along the water pollution gradient in Gilgel Gibe watershed, Ethiopia. Water quality parameters and macroinvertebrate community attributes were assessed for samples collected from upstream sites (15 sites), urban-impacted stretches (12 sites) and wetland-affected river zones (7 sites) of the watershed during the rainy (July) and dry (February) seasons. To understand the effect of pollution on the feeding interactions, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were analyzed. Macroinvertebrate-based diversity indices and functional feeding type metric showed deterioration of ecological integrity at the urban-impacted sites and substantial recovery in the wetland-affected downstream sites. Omnivorous feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates was noted for the upstream sites, whereas clear trophic guilds of FFG5 were suggested for the wetland-affected river zones by the stable isotope results. The results of pollution gradient analysis and feeding interactions among FFGs revealed that the urban-impacted sites showed weaker interactions when compared to upstream and wetland influenced sites. This affirms the potential importance of feeding interactions among FFGs of macroinvertebrates in water quality monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	4.4

The technological advancements in mobile connectivity services such as GPRS, GSM, 3G, 4G, Blue-tooth, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi made mobile phones a necessary component of our daily lives. Also, mobile phones have become smart which let the users perform routine tasks on the go. However, this rapid increase in technology and tremendous usage of the smartphones make them vulnerable to malware and other security breaching attacks. This diverse range of mobile connectivity services, device software platforms, and standards make it critical to look at the holistic picture of the current developments in smartphone security research. In this paper, our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we review the threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and their solutions over the period of 2010-2015 with a special focus on smartphones. Attacks are categorized into two types, i.e., old attack and new attacks. With this categorization, we aim to provide an easy and concise view of different attacks and the possible solutions to improve smartphone security. Secondly, we critically analyze our findings and estimate the market growth of different operating systems for the smartphone in coming years. Furthermore, we estimate the malware growth and forecast the world in 2020.	0.4
Runoff coefficients are widely used as a diagnostic variable of runoff generation in process studies and as an important input parameter in hydrologic design. Many regions of Saudi Arabia do not have sufficient historical records and the detailed runoff information needed for physically based distribution models. The US Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (USDA-NRCS-CN) method was used in this study for determining the curve number and runoff depth for Asir region, Saudi Arabia. Runoff curve number was determined based on the factors of hydrologic soil group, land use and land cover, and slope gradient in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia using the geographic information system (GIS). The region was not subjected before for any previous studies concerning runoff generation or rainwater harvesting by using GIS and remote sensing. ArcGIS 9.3 and the global positioning system were used to develop the soil map on the basis of samples collected during a field survey. Soil textures were identified and used to build a map of the hydrological soil groups. Unsupervised and supervised classification of Landsat images was used to generate land use and land cover maps. The land cover distribution in the study area revealed that the largest class in the area, barren and sparsely vegetated land, occupied 62,832.38 km(2) of the study area (more than 80 % of the total area), followed by shrubland (15,212.66 km(2)), cropland and pasture (52.34 km(2)), mixed shrubland/grassland (40.89 km(2)), and grassland (12.27 km(2)). Built-up land occupied only 11.45 km(2). The slope map for the Asir region was generated from a 15-m digital elevation model. The GIS technique was used to develop the CN for the region based on the Soil Conservation Service method. The annual runoff depth was derived from the annual rainfall and CN per pixel using the raster calculator tool in ArcGIS. The rainfall distribution in the study area showed the wise identification of suitable sites for rainwater harvesting, as most of the constructed dams were located in the areas with higher rainfall. The analysis also revealed that the annual runoff for the study area ranged from 27 to 69 % of the total rainfall, with variation as low as 80 to 300 mm/year. This is the highest amount of runoff that can be generated in Saudi Arabia. The runoff volume was calculated for the entire region using the previously developed runoff depth map and basin areas. The results showed that the runoff volume (M3) in the Asir region varied from as low as 237,000 m(3) to a maximum of 2,140,000 m(3); this result revealed a significant yearly amount of runoff that can be harvested for any use. Moreover, the calculated runoff depth in the area agreed with the actual dam capacities for the existing dams in the Asir region. This approach can be applied in other regions in Saudi Arabia for rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge.	4.3
This paper presents a non-verbal and non-facial method for effective communication of a mechanoid robot by conveying the emotions through gestures. This research focuses on human-robot interaction using a mechanoid robot that does not possess any anthropomorphic facial features for conveying gestures. Another feature of this research is the use of human-like smooth motion of this mechanoid robot in contrast to the traditional trapezoidal velocity profile for its communication. For conveying gestures, the connection between motion of robot and perceived emotions is established by varying the velocity and acceleration of the mechanoid structure. The selected motion parameters are changed systematically to observe the variation in perceived emotions. The perceived emotions have been further investigated using three different emotional behavior models: Russell's circumplex model of affect, Tellegen-Watson-Clark model and PAD model. Results obtained show that the designated motion parameters are linked with the change of emotions. Moreover, the emotions perceived by the user are same through all three models, validating the reliability of all the three emotional scale models and also of the emotions perceived by the user.	2.3
An understanding of the hydraulic system is one of the learning objectives of the manufacturing engineering studies. Generally, knowledge of the hydraulic system its components learned from textbooks. The existence of conventional tutorial props are considered can help the understanding of these materials, but this has not enough ability to give a clear illustration how each component in the system is working. This paper aims to look at how far a custom made hydraulic system tutorial props with a transparent flow concept can improve the competence of students in the understanding work of the hydraulic system. The tutorial props of hydraulic system are designed with the theme of material handling, using the robotic 3-arm with a dual-acting cylinder actuator to support the movement of each arm. All components flowed by fluid including valves, hoses, pumps, and actuators are made from transparent material and flowed with visible-colored fluid. The whole system and each component are equipped with a label containing its name and schematic symbol with fluid flow direction. The tutorial props can be operated manually and designed to be easily knocked down. Based on verification using the questionnaire of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to 30 students obtained a value of 3.52 which indicates that the tutorial props are quite acceptable. While based on implementation test by comparing the difference in value between the pretest and posttest of 15 students using textbooks learning method and 15 students using the tutorial props learning method, found that there are significant differences which indicate that using the tutorial props is a better learning method.

There is a rich literature on the nature of mental health-related stigma and the processes by which it severely affects the life chances of people with mental health problems. However, applying this knowledge to deliver and evaluate interventions to reduce discrimination and stigma in a lasting way is a complex and long-term challenge. We conducted a narrative synthesis of systematic reviews published since 2012, and supplemented this with papers published subsequently as examples of more recent work. There is evidence for small to moderate positive impacts of both mass media campaigns and interventions for target groups in terms of stigma-related knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviour in terms of desire for contact. However, the limited evidence from longer follow-up times suggests that it is not clear whether short-term contact interventions have a lasting impact. The risk that short-term interventions may only have a short-term impact suggests a need to study longer term interventions and to use interim process and outcome data to improve interventions along the way. There is scope for more thorough application of intergroup contact theory whenever contact is used and of evidence-based teaching and assessment methods when skills training is used for target groups.	2.0
Background: Suicide is a major public health concern, particularly among people who use illicit substances and/or non-prescribed medications. Methods: The present study prospectively assessed the incidence and predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) among 868 substance-using patients over 12 months after receiving primary care within seven public primary care clinics. Results: Participants reported a high incidence of SI (25.9%) and SA (7.1%) over the year following primary care visits. Suicidality was elevated in patients who were female; lacked a high school diploma; were unemployed; reported depression, anxiety, hallucinations, concentration difficulty, or violent behavior; used nicotine or stimulants; used the emergency department or mental health services in the past 90 days; reported current quality-of-life impairment in mobility or usual activities; or reported recent SI or lifetime SA at baseline. In multiple regression analyses, only past 30-day SI, any lifetime SA, past 90-day violent behavior, and current impairment due to anxiety or depression at baseline uniquely predicted SI or SA beyond other variables. Conclusions: Results support the need for screening for suicidality among primary care patients who use illicit substances and identify key of these patients who are at particularly elevated risk for suicidality.	5.0
Attack intention recognition is to reason and judge the goal of attackers according to attack behavior and network environment. In order to deal with the dynamical character of offense-defense confrontation, a dynamical real-time network attack intention recognition algorithm was proposed. By correlating real-time security alerts and vulnerabilities, we recognized the spread route and stage of attacks based on graph theory and probability theory. Then we identified the attack intention and predicted the possible transition of attacks, combined with network connectivity relationship. A simulation experiments for the proposed network attack intention recognition algorithm is performed by network examples. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be more accurately identify attack intention and fully predict the post stage of attacks.	0.2
There are 0.6-1.9% of US children who were born with congenital heart malformations. Clinical and animal studies suggest that abnormal blood flow forces might play a role in causing these malformation, highlighting the importance of understanding the fetal cardiovascular fluid mechanics. We performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of the right ventricles, based on four-dimensional ultrasound scans of three 20-wk-old normal human fetuses, to characterize their flow and energy dynamics. Peak intraventricular pressure gradients were found to be 0.2-0.9 mmHg during systole, and 0.1-0.2 mmHg during diastole. Diastolic wall shear stresses were found to be around 1 Pa, which could elevate to 2-4 Pa during systole in the outflow tract. Fetal right ventricles have complex flow patterns featuring two interacting diastolic vortex rings, formed during diastolic E wave and A wave. These rings persisted through the end of systole and elevated wall shear stresses in their proximity. They were observed to conserve similar to 25.0% of peak diastolic kinetic energy to be carried over into the subsequent systole. However, this carried-over kinetic energy did not significantly alter the work done by the heart for ejection. Thus, while diastolic vortexes played a significant role in determining spatial patterns and magnitudes of diastolic wall shear stresses, they did not have significant influence on systolic ejection. Our results can serve as a baseline for future comparison with diseased hearts.	3.4
We study supply function competition among conventional power generators with different levels of flexibility and the impact of intermittent renewable power generation on the competition. Inflexible generators commit production before uncertainties are realized, whereas flexible generators can adjust their production after uncertainties are realized. Both types of generators compete in an electricity market by submitting supply functions to a system operator, who solves a two-stage stochastic program to determine the production level for each generator and the corresponding market prices. We aim to gain an understanding of how conventional generators' (in) flexibility and renewable energy's intermittency affect the supply function competition and the market price. We find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition, and even more so when more intermittent generation is introduced into the system. The policy of economically curtailing intermittent generation intensifies the market competition, reduces price volatility, and improves the system's overall efficiency. Furthermore, these benefits of economic curtailment are most significant when the production-based subsidies for renewable energy are absent.	1.0
An extensive database on the toxicity and modes of action of ethylene glycol (EG) has been developed over the past several decades. Although renal toxicity has long been recognized as a potential outcome, in recent years developmental toxicity, an effect observed only in rats and mice, has become the subject of extensive research and regulatory reviews to establish guidelines for human exposures. The developmental toxicity of EG has been attributed to the intermediate metabolite, glycolic acid (GA), which can become a major metabolite when EG is administered to rats and mice at high doses and dose rates. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to integrate the extensive mode of action and pharmacokinetic data on EG and GA for use in developmental risk assessments. The resulting PBPK model includes inhalation, oral, dermal, intravenous, and subcutaneous routes of administration. Metabolism of EG and GA were described in the liver with elimination via the kidneys. Metabolic rate constants and partition coefficients for EG and GA were estimated from in vitro studies. Other biochemical constants were optimized from appropriate in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Several controlled rat and human metabolism studies were used to validate the resulting PBPK model. When internal dose surrogates were compared in rats and humans over a broad range of exposures, it was concluded that humans are unlikely to achieve blood levels of GA that have been associated with developmental toxicity in rats following occupational or environmental exposures.	6.2

In computer vision research, the first most important step is to represent the captured object into some mathematical transformed feature vector describing the proper shape, texture and/or color information for the classification. To understand the nature's biodiversity, together with computer vision (CV), the emerging ubiquitous mobile technologies are now used. Therefore, in this paper, a novel low computational, efficient, and accurate rotation-scaletranslation invariant shape profile transform called Angle View Projection (AVP) is proposed. The leaf images captured via mobile devices are transformed to an AVP shape profile curve (a set of four shapelets) and then compacted using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to improve the performance of the system. It also reduces the energy consumption of the device. The algorithm is tested on five different types of leaf datasets: Flavia dataset, 100 plant species leaves dataset, Swedish database, Intelligent Computing Laboratory leaf dataset and Diseased leaf dataset. An 'Agent' on mobile device decides whether the module needs to offload to the Server or to compute on the device itself. The experiments carried out clearly indicates that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art with a fast response time even in a low vision environment. AVP also outperforms other methods when tested over incomplete leaves caused due to the physiological or pathological phenomenon. This AVP shape profile based mobile plant biometric system is developed for general applications in our society to better understand the nature and helps in botanical studies and researches.	0.0
ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is expressed in the hippocampus and cortex of the brain and was confirmed to be involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have demonstrated that ABCA7 regulated A beta production, lipid transport, leading to AD characteristic pathological changes. However, the role and mechanism of ABCA7 in the context of AD needs further research. We augmented the expression of ABCA7 using lentiviral vector carrying ABCA7 gene to investigate the effect of ABCA7 overexpression on AD mice; then, we further explored the underlying mechanism in vitro. In the present study, ABCA7 was expressed successfully in the hippocampus of AD mice through lentiviral vector mediating ABCA7 gene; we showed that ABCA7 overexpression can effectively improve cognitive behavior of AD mice and diminished A beta production; meanwhile, ABCA7 overexpression significantly relieved the neurotoxicity of A beta by promoting cell viability and reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. In conclusion, our findings showed that ABCA7 had obvious anti-A beta effect and appeared to improve cognitive function of AD mice. Our results provided a new thought and basic scientific data for the clinical treatment of AD.	5.2
Accurate rainfall-runoff modeling during typhoon events is an essential task for natural disaster reduction. In this study, a novel hybrid model which integrates the outputs of physically based hydrologic modeling system into support vector machine is developed to predict hourly runoff discharges in Chishan Creek basin in southern Taiwan. Seven storms (with a total of 1200 data sets) are used for model calibration (training) and validation. Six statistical indices (mean absolute error, root mean square error, correlation coefficient, error of time to peak discharge, error of peak discharge, and coefficient of efficiency) are employed to assess prediction performance. Overall, superiority of the present approach especially for a longer (6-h) lead time prediction is revealed through a systematic comparison among three individual methods (i.e., the physically based hydrologic model, artificial neural network, and support vector machine) as well as their two hybrid combinations. Besides, our analysis and in-depth discussions further clarify the roles of physically based and data-driven components in the proposed framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
PURPOSE. This in vitro study evaluated the effects of four different cements on the color attributes of a zirconia ceramic. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 40 zirconia ceramic disk specimens (0.5 mm thickness, 10 mm diameter, 0.1 mm cement space) were fabricated by a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing system. The specimens were divided into 4 groups of 10 specimens and cemented to composite substrates using four different cements including: Glass lonomer, Panavia F2.0, Zinc Phosphate, and TempBond. The L*, a*, and b* color attributes of the specimens were measured before and after cementation by a spectrophotometer. Additionally, Delta E values were measured to determine color changes for the groups and then compared with the perceptional threshold of Delta E = 3.3. Repeated Measures ANOVA, Tukey Post Hoc, Bonferroni, One-way ANOVA, and One-sample t-test tests were used to analyze the data. All tests were carried out at the 0.05 level of significance. RESULTS. Statistically significant differences were detected in the AE values for Zinc Phosphate (P<.0001) and TempBond (P<.0001) groups. However, there were no statistically significant differences in this respect for Glass lonomer (P=.99) and Panavia F2.0 (P=1) groups. The means and standard deviations of the Delta E values for Glass lonomer, Panavia F2.0, Zinc Phosphate, and Tempbond groups were 2.11 +/- 0.66, 0.94 +/- 0.39, 5.77 +/- 0.83, and 7.50 +/- 1.16 Unit, respectively. CONCLUSION. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that Zinc Phosphate and Tempbond cements affected the color attributes of the tested zirconia ceramic beyond the perceptional threshold. However, Glass lonomer and Panavia F2.0 cements created acceptable color changes.	3.0
New developments in stem cell biology offer alternatives for the reconstruction of critical-sized bone defects. One of these developments is the use of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These stem cells are similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells, but can be generated from adult somatic cells and therefore do not raise ethical concerns. Proper characterization of iPS-derived osteoblasts is important for future development of safe clinical applications of these cells. For this reason, we differentiated mouse ES and iPS cells toward osteoblasts using osteogenic medium and compared their functionality. Immunocytochemical analysis showed significant expression of bone markers (osteocalcin and collagen type I) in osteoblasts differentiated from ES and iPS cells on days 7 and 30. An in vitro mineralization assay confirmed the functionality of osteogenically differentiated ES and iPS cells. Gene expression arrays focusing on osteogenic differentiation were performed in order to compare the gene expression pattern in both differentiated and undifferentiated ES cells and iPS cells. We observed a significant upregulation of osteogenesis-related genes such as Runx2, osteopontin, collagen type I, Tnfsf11, Csf1, and alkaline phosphatase upon osteogenic differentiation of the ES and iPS cells. We further validated the expression of key osteogenic genes Runx2, osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen type I, and osterix in both differentiated and undifferentiated ES and iPS cells by means of quantified real-time polymerase chain reaction. We conclude that ES and iPS cells are similar in their osteogenic differentiation capacities, as well as in their gene expression patterns.	6.1
This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of two instrumented sections of a geosynthetic-reinforced soil wall, 5.6 m high, constructed using a lateritic fine-grained soil. Two sections with identical layout of a nonwoven and a woven geotextile were monitored for comparison purposes. The unconfined tensile stiffness of the nonwoven geotextile was three times smaller than that of the woven geotextile. This allowed direct evaluation of the effect of soil confinement on geotextile stiffness. Instrumentation was used to measure face displacements, reinforcement displacement and strains, and soil matric suction. Rainfall occurred both during and after construction, which facilitated evaluation of the effect of soil wetting on the walls performance. Ultimate and serviceability limit state analyses were conducted to gain further insight into the performance of the two walls. The results show that the performance of the section reinforced with nonwoven geotextile was equivalent to the one reinforced with woven geotextile, even after the observed reduction in matric suction after rainfall. For both sections, the overall deformations occurred during construction. Negligible deformations were observed during service. Maximum face displacements were measured in the lowest instrumented layer for the nonwoven geotextile section whereas it was in the highest layer for the woven geotextile section. These behaviours of face displacement distributions can be the result of the significant differences in global stiffness of the sections. Design analyses and field performance show that soil confinement has a beneficial effect on the nonwoven geotextile stiffness. The significant contribution of the soil cohesion of the lateritic soil played an important role in the behaviour of the nonwoven geotextile-reinforced wall.	4.1
Individual differences such as social anxiety and extraversion have been shown to influence education outcomes. However, there has been limited investigation of the relationship between individual differences and attitudes towards online and offline learning. This study aimed to investigate for the first time how social anxiety and extraversion influence student attitudes to online and offline learning, specifically in relation to tertiary level practical activities. Based on the social compensation hypothesis, it was predicted that students with higher levels of extraversion and lower levels of social anxiety would report more favourable attitudes to face-to-face learning activities. It was further predicted that less extraverted and more socially anxious students would have more favourable attitudes to online learning activities. Undergraduate students (N = 322, 67% female) completed the HEXACO-60 personality inventory, the Mini Social Phobia Inventory, and measures of attitudes towards online and offline activities. Two hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted. The first revealed that neither extraversion nor social anxiety contributed significantly to preference for online practical activities. The second regression revealed that greater emotionality, greater extraversion, greater conscientiousness, and lower levels of social anxiety were associated with more favourable attitudes towards face-to-face practical activities. In contrast to predictions, extraversion and social anxiety did not significantly contribute to attitudes to online learning activities. However, in line with predictions, greater extraversion and lower levels of social anxiety were associated with more favourable attitudes towards face-to-face practical activities. These findings indicate that online learning activities have limited compensatory effects for students who experience social discomfort, and that the social compensation hypothesis may apply within an educational framework, but in unexpected ways.

Liberals and conservatives both express prejudice toward ideologically dissimilar others (Brandt et al., 2014). Previous work on ideological prejudice did not take advantage of evidence showing that ideology is multidimensional, with social and economic ideologies representing related but separable belief systems. In 5 studies (total N = 4912), we test 3 competing hypotheses of a multidimensional account of ideological prejudice. The dimension-specific symmetry hypothesis predicts that social and economic ideologies differentially predict prejudice against targets who are perceived to vary on the social and economic political dimensions, respectively. The social primacy hypothesis predicts that such ideological worldview conflict is experienced more strongly along the social than economic dimension. The social-specific asymmetry hypothesis predicts that social conservatives will be more prejudiced than social liberals, with no specific hypotheses for the economic dimension. Using multiple target groups, multiple prejudice measures (e. g., global evaluations, behavior), and multiple social and economic ideology measures (self-placement, issue positions), we found relatively consistent support for the dimension-specific symmetry and social primacy hypotheses, and no support for the social-specific asymmetry hypothesis. These results suggest that worldview conflict and negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors are dimension-specific, but that the social dimension appears to inspire more political conflict than the economic dimension.	2.0
It has been stated that roughly 50% of electrical incidents involve workers whose primary function is not electrical in nature. It also encouraged all to address electrical safety for all workers and not just workers whose job responsibilities involve working on or near energized electrical circuits. In this paper, a program which includes specific briefings to non-electrical workers as well as to workers who may need to perform their normal activities in proximity to energized electrical conductors is presented. The program uses a targeted approach to specific areas such as welding, excavating, rigging, chart reading, switching, cord and plug equipment and several other general areas to point out hazards that may exist and how to avoid them. The site experience over the years supports the assertion that about half of the electrical incidents involve non-electrical workers and this prompted us to develop specific briefings to enhance the knowledge of the non-electrical worker regarding safe electrical practices. The promotion of May is Electrical Safety Month and the development of informative presentations which are delivered to the general site population as well as electrical workers have greatly improved the hazards awareness status of the general worker on site.	1.2
Rationale Social cognition influences social interactions. Alcohol reportedly facilitates social interactions. However, the acute effects of alcohol on social cognition are relatively poorly studied. We investigated the effects of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beer on emotion recognition, empathy, and sexual arousal using the dynamic face emotion recognition task (FERT), Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), and Sexual Arousal Task (SAT) in a double-blind, random-order, cross-over study in 60 healthy social drinkers. We also assessed subjective effects using visual analog scales (VASs), blood alcohol concentrations, and plasma oxytocin levels. Alcohol increased VAS ratings of stimulated, happy, talkative, open, and want to be with others. The subjective effects of alcohol were greater in participants with higher trait inhibitedness. Alcohol facilitated the recognition of happy faces on the FERT and enhanced emotional empathy for positive stimuli on the MET, particularly in participants with low trait empathy. Pictures of explicit sexual content were rated as less pleasant than neutral pictures after non-alcoholic beer but not after alcoholic beer. Explicit sexual pictures were rated as more pleasant after alcoholic beer compared with non-alcoholic beer, particularly in women. Alcohol did not alter the levels of circulating oxytocin. Alcohol biased emotion recognition toward better decoding of positive emotions and increased emotional concern for positive stimuli. No support was found for a modulatory role of oxytocin. Alcohol also facilitated the viewing of sexual images, consistent with disinhibition, but it did not actually enhance sexual arousal. These effects of alcohol on social cognition likely enhance sociability. www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02318823 RefTarget Address=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02318823 TargetType=URL/>	2.1
Particle selectivity of the sediment deposited over vegetative barriers is of importance to predict sediment transport and particulate pollutant load into surface waters. Grassed barriers with 20-90% covers at 15 degrees slope were subjected to silt-laden inflows in the presence and absence of simulated rainfalls to investigate the sediment deposition processes. The results show that regrass of steep croplands can effectively trap eroded sediment from upslope, and the rowed grass barriers can strengthen sediment deposition. The deposition order of sediment particle sizes (m) follows (>50)>(25-50)>(10-25)=((2-10), and the particle selectivity weakens with increasing grass covers. Clay particles had a similar deposition efficiency to overall sediment, implying the effectiveness of regrass in controlling soil nutrient loss. The contribution of grass to total overland flow resistance is almost equivalent to the percentage of grass cover. For steep grassed slopes, raindrop impact significantly decreases sediment deposition, but limitedly affects particle selectivity of deposited sediment and overland flow hydraulics. Both raindrop kinetic energy and stream power available for surface soil contribute to sediment deposition in net deposition areas of grass barriers. These imply that rainfall effect on sediment delivery over vegetated barriers derives from the additional raindrop energy, rather than the variation in runoff hydraulics. These results can help to clarify the effect of raindrop impact on sediment transport and to evaluate the benefit of revegetation in decreasing sediment yield and its particulate nutrient load into surface waters.	3.1
Recent studies on brain imaging analysis witnessed the core roles of machine learning techniques in computer-assisted intervention for brain disease diagnosis. Of various machine-learning techniques, sparse regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data but with a small number of training samples, especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods have been making great successes by outperforming the state-of-the-art performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse regression and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse regression models as target-level representations, we then build a deep convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we call 'Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.' To our best knowledge, this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks. We also rigorously analyzed our results and compared with the previous studies on the ADNI cohort in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
Tetrahydroprotoberberines (THPB) have a high affinity for dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors and may provide a novel treatment for drug addiction. We assessed the effects of the THPB D-govadine on the acquisition, expression, extinction and reinstatement of D-amphetamine -(1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Furthermore, the effects of D-govadine on conditioned association between contextual stimuli and a natural reward were examined using food-induced CPP. In separate experiments, rats received D-govadine (0, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) before a) each D-amphetamine injection during conditioning, b) expression of amphetamine-induced CPP, c) each extinction session, d) amphetamine-induced reinstatement of CPP, ore) placement into a compartment containing food during conditioning. Although D-govadine had no effect on acquisition of amphetamine CPP, treatment with D-govadine during acquisition dose-dependently extinguished a preference for the amphetamine-associated context more quickly than vehicle treatment. Moreover, D-govadine treatment facilitated the extinction of amphetamine CPP when given repeatedly throughout the extinction phase. Although the expression of amphetamine CPP was not affected by D-govadine administered prior to the expression test, amphetamine-induced reinstatement of CPP following an extinction period was blocked by D-govadine (1.0 mg/kg). The intermediate dose of D-govadine blocked the acquisition of food CPP, whereas the high dose facilitated extinction of this preference as compared to vehicle-treated animals. Therefore, D-govadine attenuates the maintenance of conditioned associations between contextual stimuli and amphetamine or food reward, as well as amphetamine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking behaviour. As such, D-govadine may be a candidate for further development as a pharmacological treatment of psychostimulant drug dependence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	5.0
Non-spherical particles are known to orient preferentially in near-wall turbulence, but rod-like and disk-like particles align themselves differently relative to the mean vorticity direction. To uncover the mechanism that gives rise to such preferential particle orientations in anisotropic turbulence, Lagrangian statistics from a channelflow simulation have been analysed. Ni et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 743, 2014, R3) showed that the fluid vorticity and long rods independently aligned with the Lagrangian fluid stretching direction in isotropic turbulence. Following their approach, we deduced the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor along Lagrangian trajectories of tracer spheroids in channel-flow turbulence. The results showed that the alignment of the fluid vorticity vector with the strongest Lagrangian stretching direction in the channel centre, just as in isotropic turbulence, vanished in the vicinity of the walls. The analysis revealed that the directions of the strongest Lagrangian stretching and compression in near-wall turbulence are in the streamwise and wall-normal directions, respectively. All over the channel we found that the symmetry axis of prolate spheroids aligned with the direction of strongest Lagrangian stretching whereas oblate spheroids oriented with the direction of Lagrangian compression. This finding is apparently universal since the same trends were found in highly anisotropic wall turbulence as well as in isotropic turbulence. Contrary to the prevailing view, we have shown for the first time that the preferential orientation of the symmetry axis of long rods in the streamwise direction and of flat disks in the wall-normal direction is caused by Lagrangian stretching and not by fluid rotation. This finding fills a gap in our understanding of orientation and rotation of tracer spheroids in anisotropic wall turbulence.	3.4
The present research focuses on improvement of various soil properties and strength parameters of clayey subgrade using geogrid (biaxial) and geotextile (nonwoven) placed through various reinforcement systems viz. Single layer reinforcement system (SIL), composite layer reinforcement system (COL), multi layer reinforcement system(ML) at various position/levels of subgrade thickness. A high strength geotextile and a biaxial geogrid are used as geosynthetic reinforcement materials in this study. Soaked and Unsoaked CBR tests were performed on expansive soil (CI and CH soil) using above mentioned reinforcement systems. The main objective of this study is to know the most efficient geosynthetic reinforcement system and position of reinforcement for medium expansive soil (CI) and highly expansive soil (CH) of Gujarat region.. Given results depicts that infusion of geosynthetic reinforcement at various levels of subgrade note only improves CBR value but overall its increases the structural stability of the subgrade. Out of various subgrade systems composite reinforced system at position of h/5 gave the maximum CBR value and its calibration with modulus of subgrade reaction (K) was quite compatible.	4.1
Purpose - The losses incurred in ferromagnetic materials under PWM excitations must be predicted accurately to optimize the design of modern electrical machines. The purpose of this paper is to employ mathematical hysteresis models (i.e. classical Preisach model) to predict iron losses in electrical steels under PWM excitation without compromising the computational complexity of the model. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a novel approach based on the dynamic inverse Preisach model is proposed to model the iron losses. The PWM magnetic flux density waveform is decomposed into its harmonic component using Fourier series and a weighted Everett function is computed based on these harmonic components. The Preisach model is applied for the given flux waveform and results are validated against the measurements. Findings - The paper predicts the total iron loss by computing a weighted Everett function based on the harmonics present in PWM waveform. Moreover, it formulates the possibility of utilizing the classical Preisach model to predict iron losses under PWM excitation. Research limitations/implications - The approach is still limited in terms of its application at high frequencies. This work may eventually lead toward the accurate prediction of iron loss under PWM excitation in electromagnetic machine design. Practical implications - The paper provides a simple approach applying the Preisach model for the prediction of iron losses under PWM excitation. The proposed approach does not require additional experimental data beyond B-H loops measured under sinusoidal excitation. Originality/value - A novel approach is presented to incorporate the frequency dependence into a static inverse Preisach model. The approach extends the ability of the static Preisach model to compute total iron loss under PWM excitation using a weighted Everett function.	3.3
Urbanization globally is consistently reshaping the natural landscape to accommodate the growing human population. Urban vegetation plays a key role in moderating environmental impacts caused by urbanization and is critically important for local economic, social and cultural development. The differing patterns of human population growth, varying urban structures and development stages, results in highly varied spatial and temporal vegetation patterns particularly in the pan-Pacific region which has some of the fastest urbanization rates globally. Yet spatially-explicit temporal information on the amount and change of urban vegetation is rarely documented particularly in less developed nations. Remote sensing offers an exceptional data source and a unique perspective to map urban vegetation and change due to its consistency and ubiquitous nature. In this research, we assess the vegetation fractions of 25 cities across 12 pan-Pacific countries using annual gap-free Landsat surface reflectance products acquired from 1984 to 2012, using sub-pixel, spectral unmixing approaches. Vegetation change trends were then analyzed using Mann-Kendall statistics and Theil-Sen slope estimators. Unmixing results successfully mapped urban vegetation for pixels located in urban parks, forested mountainous regions, as well as agricultural land (correlation coefficient ranging from 0.66 to 0.77). The greatest vegetation loss from 1984 to 2012 was found in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian in China. In contrast, cities including Vancouver (Canada) and Seattle (USA) showed stable vegetation trends through time. Using temporal trend analysis, our results suggest that it is possible to reduce noise and outliers caused by phenological changes particularly in cropland using dense new Landsat time series approaches. We conclude that simple yet effective approaches of unmixing Landsat time series data for assessing spatial and temporal changes of urban vegetation at regional scales can provide critical information for urban planners and anthropogenic studies globally.

While female participation in work places has increased over the last decades, women only make up 1-2 % of the 1.25 million seafarers worldwide. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Labor Organizations are making a concerted effort to promote women into the maritime industry. Still, there are barriers in the maritime industry that hinder female employment, particularly in leadership positions. The primary aim of the paper is to investigate whether there is a significant difference in implicit beliefs about leadership between males and females. In addition to this, it seeks to evaluate whether the aforementioned difference is within the context of masculine versus neutral work domains. The findings indicated that employees in the maritime industry might have lower expectations towards female leaders thereby indicating the presence of gender bias in the evaluation of leaders.	2.0
Among the food-related health issues, the presence of contaminants has a prominent role, due to the wide range of exogenous compounds that can occur in food commodities and to their large differences in structure and biological activity. A comprehensive assessment of the related risk is thus actually demanding in terms of time and facilities involved. In this context, the use of computational strategies can be an effective choice for supporting the hazard identification procedure at the early stage. In this work we focused on the food contaminant zearalenone by comparing the trans and cis isomers, respectively the well-known mycoestrogen and its still largely understudied isomer. We estimated the possible effects exerted by human metabolism on the xenoestrogenicity of cis-ZEN by using a validated in silica strategy based on docking simulations and rescoring procedures. Similarly, the exploitation of the most promising enzymatic detoxifying routes designed for trans-ZEN - which relies on the enzyme lactono hydrolase from Clonostachys rosea - has been assessed for the cis-isomer as well. Our results showed that both isomers can act as functional analogues with respect to xenoestrogenic activity, and several cis-ZEN metabolites with high biological potential have been identified. On the contrary, in spite of the high degree of structural analogy, the cis isomer showed a pattern of interaction with the degrading enzyme in stark contrast with that observed for trans-ZEN. For these reasons, the outcomes presented herein strongly support the inclusion of cis-ZEN in further studies of occurrence, metabolism and bioactivity assessment, and suggest the need for a dedicated handling for the cis isomer in risk assessment studies.

This paper describes the architecture and functionality of a generic agent that is in charge of handling a given environment in an Ambient Intelligence context, ensuring suitable contextualized and personalized support to the user's actions, adaptivity to the user's peculiarities and to changes over time, and automated management of the environment itself. The architecture is implemented in a multi-agent system, where different types of agents are endowed with different levels of reasoning and learning capabilities. In addition to controlling normal operations of the environment, the system may identify user's needs and goals and activate suitable workflows to satisfy them. Some actions in these workflow involve the execution of semantic services. When a single service is not available for fulfilling a given need, an automatic service composer is used to obtain a suitable combination of services. The architecture has been implemented in a prototypical agent-based system that works in a Smart Home Environment.	4.0
BackgroundPavlovian-Instrumental-Transfer (PIT) examines the effects of associative learning upon instrumental responding. Previous studies examining PIT with ethanol (EtOH)-maintained responding showed increases in responding following presentation of an EtOH-paired conditioned stimulus (CS). Recently, we conducted 2 studies examining PIT with an EtOH-paired CS. One of these found increases in responding, while the other did not. This less robust demonstration of PIT may have resulted from the form of the CS used, as we used a 120-second light stimulus as a CS, while the previous studies used either a 120-second auditory stimulus or a 10-second light stimulus. This study examined whether using conditions similar to our earlier study, but with either a 120-second auditory or a 10-second light stimulus as a CS, resulted in more robust PIT. We also examined the reliability of our previous failure to observe PIT. MethodsThree experiments were conducted examining whether PIT was obtained using (i) a 120-second light stimulus, (ii) a 10-second light stimulus, or (iii) a 120-second auditory stimulus as CSs. ResultsWe found PIT was not obtained using (i) a 120-second light stimulus as a CS, (ii) a 10-second light stimulus as a CS, or (iii) a 120-second auditory stimulus as a CS. ConclusionsThese results suggest that CS form does not account for our earlier failure to see PIT. Rather, factors like rat strain or how EtOH drinking is induced may account for when PIT is or is not observed.	5.0
We investigated the role of self-focused attention (SFA) in social anxiety (disorder) in an ecologically valid way. In Experiment 1 high (n = 26) versus low (n = 25) socially anxious single women between 18 and 30 years had a video (Slcype) conversation with an attractive male confederate, while seeing themselves and the confederate on-screen. The conversation was divided in four phases: (I) warm-up, (II) positive (confederate was friendly to the participant), (III) critical (confederate was critical to the participant), and (IV) active (participant was instructed to ask questions to the confederate). Participant's SFA was measured by eye-tracked gaze duration at their own image relative to the confederates' video image and other places at the computer screen. Results show that high socially anxious participants were more self-focused in the critical phase, but less self-focused in the active phase than low socially anxious participants. In Experiment 2 women diagnosed with SAD (n = 32) and controls (n = 30) between 18 and 30 years conducted the same experiment. Compared to controls participants with SAD showed increased SFA across all four phases of the conversation, and SFA predicted increased self-rated anxiety during the conversation. In conclusion, in subclinical social anxiety SFA is high only when the interaction partner is critical, whereas instructions to ask questions to the confederate reduces subclinical socially anxious' SFA, while clinical SAD is characterized by heightened self-focused attention throughout the interaction. Results support theories that social anxiety disorder is maintained by SFA, and imply that interventions that lower SFA may help prevent and treat social anxiety disorder, but that SFA can also be adaptive in certain types of interaction, such as when receiving compliments.

Online social networks (OSNs) gradually integrate financial capabilities by enabling the usage of real and virtual currency. They serve as new platforms to host a variety of business activities, such as online promotion events, where users can possibly get virtual currency as rewards by participating in such events. Both OSNs and business partners are significantly concerned when attackers instrument a set of accounts to collect virtual currency from these events, which make these events ineffective and result in significant financial loss. It becomes of great importance to proactively detecting these malicious accounts before the online promotion activities and subsequently decreases their priority to be rewarded. In this paper, we propose a novel system, namely ProGuard, to accomplish this objective by systematically integrating features that characterize accounts from three perspectives including their general behaviors, their recharging patterns, and the usage of their currency. We have performed extensive experiments based on data collected from the Tencent QQ, a global leading OSN with built-in financial management activities. Experimental results have demonstrated that our system can accomplish a high detection rate of 96.67% at a very low false positive rate of 0.3%.	0.2
A switched-current (SI) based beamformer, suitable for low-power and low-area applications, is presented. The most important feature of the proposed beamformer is that the current consumption does not increase linearly with memory size. This is achieved by employing external capacitors for memory storage unlike a conventional SI memory. This is a fully differential design implemented using delay and sum approach. An Analog RAM (ARAM) has been used to implement the delay and each memory cell in the ARAM has been implemented using an SI circuits. There are 16 memory cells in each ARAM consuming 35.15 mu A/cell. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 63 dB is measured after summation of 16 channels. The total current consumption of beamformer including the bias, and digital control is 9 mA and area is 1.27 mm(2). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.4
Genetic lesions that activate KRAS account for similar to 30% of the 1.6 million annual cases of lung cancer. Despite clinical need, KRAS is still undruggable using traditional small-molecule drugs/inhibitors. When oncogenic Kras is suppressed by RNA interference, tumors initially regress but eventually recur and proliferate despite suppression of Kras. Here, we show that tumor cells can survive knockout of oncogenic Kras, indicating the existence of Kras-independent survival pathways. Thus, even if clinical KRAS inhibitors were available, resistance would remain an obstacle to treatment. Kras-independent cancer cells exhibit decreased colony formation in vitro but retain the ability to form tumors in mice. Comparing the transcriptomes of oncogenic Kras cells and Kras knockout cells, we identified 603 genes that were specifically up-regulated in Kras knockout cells, including the Fas gene, which encodes a cell surface death receptor involved in physiological regulation of apoptosis. Antibodies recognizing Fas receptor efficiently induced apoptosis of Kras knockout cells but not oncogenic Kras-expressing cells. Increased Fas expression in Kras knockout cells was attributed to decreased association of repressive epigenetic marks at the Fas promoter. Concordant with this observation, treating oncogenic Kras cells with histone deacetylase inhibitor and Fas-activating antibody efficiently induced apoptosis, thus bypassing the need to inhibit Kras. Our results suggest that activation of Fas could be exploited as an Achilles' heel in tumors initiated by oncogenic Kras.	5.0
This article examines face recognition as a key instance of the emergence of smart photography. Smart photography, drawing on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Ambient Intelligence (AmI) manifests a 'habit of mind' (Karen Barad), or a way of thinking that is humanist in so far as it is predicated on human and machine autonomy, and representationalist in its quest for unmediated objects-in-themselves. Faces are among the objects that smart photography seeks (autonomously) to represent. By examining two of the principal algorithms of face recognition technology, the article will show how ways of seeing allied to ways of thinking that are also, ultimately, discriminatory and essentialist, materialise through software. Finally, if the 'smart' in smart photography means learning to discriminate between classes of faces that are fixed, essentialised and ultimately elusive (the stereotypical face of terror is both gendered and racialised) then how could smart be made smarter? This is a question of politics rather than progress.	4.0
Parentage data from beef calves has shown that in multiple-sire pastures a disproportionate number of calves are born from a single bull. Investigating and accurately quantifying bull behavior within multiple sire pastures will begin to determine reason(s) for the variability in the number of calves sired. The study objective was to assess accelerometer data and various classification algorithms to accurately predict bull behavior events in a multiple-sire pasture. Behavior events of interest in this study included lying, standing, walking, and mounting. Two bulls and ten estrous synchronized cows were used. True behavior events were determined during daylight hours with video analysis, and matched with accelerometer data. Accelerometers were attached to both ears, withers, and neck of both bulls. Accelerometer data were recorded for every second over 3 days. Accelerometer data were used to generate algorithms and accuracy was evaluated compared to known video behavioral data. The prevalence based on the raw video data for lying was 32.6%, standing was 59.4%, walking was 7.4%, and mounting was 0.6%. The random forest classifier had the highest accuracy compared to other classifiers (random tree and decision tree) for each tag location and behavior of interest. The accuracies from the random forest algorithms ranged from 92 to 99% for lying, 85 to 90% for standing, 73 to 77% for walking, and 74% to 80% for mounting. The classification algorithm was able to accurately predict a lying and standing event, and predict a walking and mounting event with a lower accuracy. Further research is needed to determine how behaviors between bulls affects overall parentage data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	0.1
Individual differences in the preference for group-based hierarchy and inequality, as indexed by social dominance orientation (SDO), have been shown to predict environment-relevant variables. To date the.literature examining the SDO-environmentalism link has used the traditional unidimensional conceptualisation of SDO. This article reports three studies using the new measurement and conceptualisation of SDO that involves the SDO7 scale and the sub-dimensions of intergroup dominance (SDO-D) and intergroup anti-egalitarianism (SDO-E). SDO-D entails support for group-based dominance achieved via overt oppression and aggressive intergroup behaviour, and SDO-E entails support for group-based inequality subtly achieved via unequal distribution of resources. Our results show anti-egalitarianism to be the main SDO sub-dimension related to environmentalism. While SDO-D is either a weaker or non-significant predictor, individuals with high levels of SDO-E were less willing to make personal sacrifices for the environment, value environmental protection and endorse climate change beliefs. Interestingly, neither facet of SDO predicted change in environmentalism over a five-month period; but climate change denial predicted change in SDO-E while pro-environmental attitudes predicted change in SDO-D over time.

Parental factors have been linked to childhood anxiety, hence, parental involvement in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxious children has been examined. However, findings do not consistently show added effects of parent-enhanced CBT, longitudinal investigations are scarce and long-term effects unclear. In the present study, 40 out of 54 families who, 3 years previously, completed one of two types of CBT treatment: with limited or active parental involvement, were assessed using semi-structured diagnostic interviews. Diagnostic status at 3-years follow-up was compared between groups. Changes in diagnostic status across assessment points: posttreatment, 6-month and 3-year follow-up were analyzed within groups. Diagnostic change from 6-month to 3-year follow-up was compared between groups. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed no significant difference in diagnostic status between groups at 3-year follow-up. Nonetheless, children whose parents actively participated in treatment showed significantly more remission from 6-month to 3-year follow-up than children with limited parental participation.	5.4
Through glacial moulins, meltwater is routed from the glacier surface to its base. Moulins are a main feature feeding subglacial drainage systems and thus influencing basal motion and ice dynamics, but their geometry remains poorly known. Here we show that analysis of the seismic wavefield generated by water falling into a moulin can help constrain its geometry. We present modeling results of hour-long seimic tremors emitted from a vertical moulin shaft, observed with a seismometer array installed at the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The tremor was triggered when the moulin water level exceeded a certain height, which we associate with the threshold for the waterfall to hit directly the surface of the moulin water column. The amplitude of the tremor signal changed over each tremor episode, in close relation to the amount of inflowing water. The tremor spectrum features multiple prominent peaks, whose characteristic frequencies are distributed like the resonant modes of a semiopen organ pipe and were found to depend on the moulin water level, consistent with a source composed of resonant tube waves (water pressure waves coupled to elastic deformation of the moulin walls) along the water-filled moulin pipe. Analysis of surface particle motions lends further support to this interpretation. The seismic wavefield was modeled as a superposition of sustained wave radiation by pressure sources on the side walls and at the bottom of the moulin. The former was found to dominate the wave field at close distance and the latter at large distance to the moulin.	3.1
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, and multiple inflammatory cytokines are involved in RA pathogenesis. Interleukin (IL)-18, in particular, has a significant positive correlation with RA. In this study, we investigated the effect of erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (Erdr1), which is negatively regulated by IL-18, in an animal model of inflammatory arthritis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. Treatment of mice with recombinant (r) Erdr1 significantly suppressed the severity of arthritis, histologic features of arthritic tissue, and serum levels of anti-collagen autoantibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgM) in CIA. In addition, IL-18 expression was reduced in the affected synovium of rErdr1-treated mice. Interestingly, Erdr1 treatment suppressed migration in contrast to the pro-migratory effect of IL-18, indicating the therapeutic effects of Erdr1 on CIA through inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration. In addition, Erdr1 inhibited activation of ERK1/2, a key signaling pathway in migration of various cell types. Taken together, these data show that rErdr1 exerts therapeutic effects on RA by inhibiting synovial fibroblast migration, suggesting that rErdr1 treatment might be an effective therapeutic approach for RA.	6.3
Objective: Patients with ADHD have been suggested to have increased risks of allergic diseases but without consistent results, and limited studies about the association between ADHD and autoimmune diseases were noted in the literature. Method: Utilizing the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, ADHD patients were identified and compared with age- and gender-matched controls (1:4). Results: In all, 8,201 participants were identified as having ADHD, and an increased prevalence of allergic diseases, including asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53), allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.59), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.53), and urticaria (OR = 1.39), compared with the control group. Although the comorbidity of autoimmune diseases with ADHD was low, ADHD patients had a significantly greater prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 2.78), ulcerative colitis (OR = 2.31), and autoimmune thyroid disease (OR = 2.53) than the controls. Conclusion: Our results supported the association between ADHD and allergic/autoimmune diseases. The further studies will be required to clarify the underlying mechanisms.	5.3
Throughout the United States, there has been a rise in public discourse about transgender people and transgender issues. Much of this attention stems from passed and proposed anti-LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) legislation, including bathroom bills that would require transgender people to use public facilities corresponding with the sex designated on their birth certificates. With the recent discussion and legislation impacting school-aged children and adolescents, what does this mean for school nurses and how can they care and advocate for their transgender students? In this article, we aim to empower school nurses to join the discussion, advocate for inclusive and equitable school policies, and deliver gender-affirming care to transgender students. We will explain transgender identities; transgender-related stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and health concerns; gender-affirming approaches in caring for transgender youth; and implications for school nurses. School nurses play a key role in creating a space that is welcoming and affirming where transgender students can thrive.	2.0
One result of globalization is the rapid growth of offshoring, i.e., the outsourcing of functions and jobs to offshore locations. In the USA, offshoring has progressed to the point where it already affects everyday lives, from the cars we drive (of which a large portion of the work and components are outsourced) to computers (which are typically manufactured offshore and shipped back to the USA), to electronic diagnostics (where calls are answered overseas). This phenomenon has implications on our lives and on the jobs that engineers and scientists will assume both now and in the future. Further, it is something that all highly developed and even some lesser-developed countries must face. Consequently, the growth of outsourcing will have a major impact on the educational objectives of engineering programs and the resultant engineering curricula worldwide. This paper presents recent data on product and job offshore migrations and discusses the various dimensions of this phenomenon. In addition to the potential loss of engineering and other high-end technical jobs, sociological and cultural aspects, intellectual property issues, strategic planning concerns, and macro-economic issues are presented. For example, the effects of offshoring on the societal fabric of the countries that are recipients of manufacturing and service center outsourcing, such as China and India, are significant, rapid, and controversial. Offshoring has also begun to change the way that engineering programs in these countries educate their students. In addition, intellectual property issues create a major risk to companies considering outsourcing to certain less-developed countries. These issues can be broadly categorized into: the robustness and strength of intellectual property laws, and the degree to which these laws are implemented and enforced. Further, such factors as currency fluctuations and geo-political conditions can substantially impact outsourcing decisions and profitability. The phenomenon of offshoring, which is now affecting engineering careers, will play a major role in shaping engineering education worldwide. The next generation of engineers will need to possess the ability to work seamlessly across cultures, have outstanding communication skills and be familiar with the principles of project management, logistics, and systems integration. Some educational models that begin to address these requirements will be presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	3.2
Two studies examined the development of constructivist theory of mind (ToM) during late childhood and early adolescence. In Study 1, a new measure was developed to assess participants' understanding of the interpretive and constructive processes embedded in memory, comprehension, attention, comparison, planning, and inference. Using this measure, Study 2 tested a mediational model in which prosocial reasoning about conflict mediated the relation between constructivist ToM and behavior problems in high school. Results showed that the onset of constructivist ToM occurs between late childhood and early adolescence and that adolescents who have more advanced constructivist ToM have more prosocial reasoning about conflict, which in turn mediated the relation with fewer serious behavior problems in high school, after controlling for academic performance and sex. In both studies, girls showed more advanced constructivist ToM than boys in high school. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.1
High-performance phase-locked loops (PLLs) are critical for power control in grid-connected systems. This paper presents a new method of designing a PLL for single-phase systems based on derivative elements (DEs). The quadrature signal generator (QSG) is constructed by two DEs with the same parameters. The PLL itself is realized by using the DE-based QSG. It avoids errors due to the overlap and accumulation that are present in PLLs based on integral elements, such as a PLL based on a second-order generalized integrator. Additionally, frequency feedback is not needed which allows the proposed PLL to achieve high performance when the grid frequency changes rapidly. This paper presents the model of the PLL and a theoretical performance analysis with respect to both the frequency-domain and time-domain behavior. The error arising from the discretization process is also compensated, ensuring this PLL method is suitable for implementation in a digital control system. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed PLL achieves good performance in both harmonic rejection and dynamic response.	1.4
A means to digitally generate a partially coherent beam with orbital angular momentum is presented. Our approach is based on encoding the randomness of broadband light passing through a spiral phase plate in a spatial light modulator. We illustrate the technique by generating partially coherent beams with orbital angular momentum content and different coherence lengths, with no moving optical elements. We study the cross correlation spectra which yields to good agreement with theory.	1.4
In recent years, it is desired that the bandwidth of a class-D amplifier is widened using sampling frequencies as low as possible. For example, it is expected in the application of the power amplifier of vibration generator that the bandwidth is kept 5[kHz] within the load impedance infinity similar to 2 [Omega]. In this paper, it is shown that this demand to the class-D amplifier can be attained by an A2DOF (Approximate 2-Degree-Of-Freedom) digital controller with 200[kHz] switching and sampling frequencies. The controller is implemented by a FPGA and it is shown from experiments that this demand is attained enough.	1.4
Head and neck reconstructive microsurgery is constantly innovating because of a combination of multidisciplinary advances. This article examines recent innovations that have affected the field as well as presenting research leading to future advancement. Innovations include the use of virtual surgical planning and three-dimensional printing in craniofacial reconstruction, advances in intraoperative navigation and imaging, as well as postoperative monitoring, development of minimally invasive reconstructive microsurgery techniques, integration of regenerative medicine and stem cell biology with reconstruction, and the dramatic advancement of face transplant.	6.1
Coming out has been described as an essential component in the lesbian, gay, and bisexual identity development process and in the mental health of sexual minority people. This study investigated the coming out to family members in lesbian, gay, and bisexual people and analyzed the potential predictors associated to the choice to come out. For this purpose, disclosure of sexual orientation to family members, internalized sexual stigma (evaluated through an adapted short version of the internalized sexual stigma for lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people, measure of the internalized sexual stigma for lesbians, gay, and bisexual), gender, age, sexual orientation, background information, current romantic relationship and the wealth of social network with sexual minority people were assessed on an Italian sample of 291 adolescents and young adults (206 lesbian/gay men and 85 bisexual people). Hierarchical multiple regression showed that higher scores of coming out to family were associated with gay/lesbian identity, liberal political orientation, higher education level, presence of a stable romantic relationship, higher number of lesbian, gay, and bisexual contacts, and lower levels of internalized sexual stigma. Results suggest that bisexual people encounter major difficulties regarding the coming out to family members, respect to lesbian/gay people and indicate that internalized sexual stigma is strongly associated with concealing one's sexual orientation. Clinical implications for the present findings are discussed.	2.0
Hydrological models and remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) models usually are used to estimate regional ET. This study aims to integrate the advantages of both the models to simulate the daily ET processes. A compromise between these two methodologies is represented by improving the optimization of the hydrological model on the basis of a new probability optimal ET series, which is produced by a data assimilation scheme combining sparse remote estimates and continuous modeling of regional ETs. The distributed time-variant gain hydrological model (DTVGM) and a two-layer remote sensing ET model are chosen. First, the DTVGM is optimized by maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of daily streamflow in the Shahe River basin, and simulates the daily hydrological processes of 1999-2007. For improving the accuracy of continuous ET simulation, the DTVGM is further optimized by dual objective functions composed of the assimilated ETs and observed outlet discharge. The results show that the accuracy of the DTVGM-based daily ETs is improved after the dual optimization, and the mean absolute percentage error between the DTVGM-based ETs and the measured ETs in the study area is reduced by 5.84%. The integrated method is proved better, and improves the hydrology modeling accuracy.	4.2
Next generation sequencing (NGS) is the emerging technology in forensic genomics laboratories. It offers higher resolution to address most problems of human identification, greater efficiency and potential ability to interrogate very challenging forensic casework samples. In this study, a trial set of DNA samples was artificially degraded by progressive aqueous hydrolysis, and analyzed together with the corresponding unmodified DNA sample and control sample 2800 M, to test the performance and reliability of the ForenSeq(TM) DNA Signature Prep kit using the MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina). The results of replicate tests performed on the unmodified sample (1.0 ng) and on scalar dilutions (1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 ng) of the reference sample 2800 M showed the robustness and the reliability of the NGS approach even from sub-optimal amounts of high quality DNA. The degraded samples showed a very limited number of reads/sample, from 2.9-10.2 folds lower than the ones reported for the less concentrated 2800 M DNA dilution (0.1 ng). In addition, it was impossible to assign up to 78.2% of the genotypes in the degraded samples as the software identified the corresponding loci as low coverage (< 50x). Amplification artifacts such as allelic imbalances, allele drop outs and a single allele drop in were also scored in the degraded samples. However, the ForenSeq(TM) DNA Sequencing kit, on the Illumina MiSeq, was able to generate data which led to the correct typing of 5.1-44.8% and 10.9-58.7% of 58 of the STRs and 92 SNPs, respectively. In all trial samples, the SNP markers showed higher chances to be typed correctly compared to the STRs. This NGS approach showed very promising results in terms of ability to recover genetic information from heavily degraded DNA samples for which the conventional PCR/CE approach gave no results. The frequency of genetic mistyping was very low, reaching the value of 1.4% for only one of the degraded samples. However, these results suggest that further validation studies and a definition of interpretation criteria for NGS data are needed before implementation of this technique in forensic genetics.	6.4
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different reconstruction plates and screw combinations on stress distribution of segmental resected mandibles using finite element analysis. Methods: Lateral (L) and lateral-central (LC) defects were simulated by a computer aided design modeling. The straight (s) and angular (a) titanium locking reconstruction plates of 2.5 mm(12 holes for L defects and 16 holes for LC defects) were modeled. Each screw was 2.5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length. A total of 20 different screw placement combinations were created. The bite force used in the present model was a unilateral molar clench. The data obtained from finite element analysis were recorded as von Mises, maximum principle and minimum principle stress values. Results: It was observed that stress values on neck of screw were higher for screws close to the resection area. When the first screw was loosened, the stress on the plate body and the remaining screws increased. Principle stress values were within the tolerance limits of the bone. Conclusion: The highest stress is observed in the screws nearest to the resection edge. Therefore, it is very important to place a screw adjacent to the resection edge.	3.0
Objective: Transmitral blood flow produces a vortex ring (quantified using vortex formation time [VFT]) that enhances the efficiency of left ventricular (LV) filling. VFT is attenuated in LV hypertrophy resulting from aortic valve stenosis (AS) versus normal LV geometry. Many patients with AS also have aortic insufficiency (AI). The authors tested the hypothesis that moderate Al falsely elevates VFT by partially inhibiting mitral leaflet opening in patients with AS. Design: Observational study. Setting: Veterans Affairs medical center. Participants: Patients with AS in the presence or absence of moderate Al (n = 8 per group) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) were studied after institutional review board approval. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Under general anesthesia, peak early LV filling (E) and atrial systole (A) blood flow velocities and their corresponding velocity-time integrals were obtained using pulse-wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to determine E/A and atrial filling fraction (beta). Mitral valve diameter (D) was calculated as the average of major and minor axis lengths obtained in the midesophageal bicommissural (transcommissural anterior lateral -posterior medial) and LV long-axis (anterior-posterior) TEE imaging planes, respectively. VFT was calculated as 4.(1-beta).SV/pi D-3, where SV = stroke volume measured using thermodilution. Hemodynamics, diastolic function, and VFT were determined during steady-state conditions before cardiopulmonary bypass. The severity of AS (mean and peak pressure gradients, peak transvalvular jet velocity, aortic valve area) and diastolic function (E/A, beta) were similar between groups. Moderate centrally directed Al was present in 8 patients with AS (ratio of regurgitant jet width to LV outflow tract diameter of 36 +/- 6%). Pulse pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure were elevated in patients with versus without Al, but no other differences in hemodynamics were observed. Mitral valve minor and major axis lengths, diameter, and area were reduced in the presence versus the absence of Al. VFT was increased significantly (5.7 +/- 1.7 v3.2 +/- 0.6; p = 0.00108) in patients with AS and Al compared with AS alone. Conclusion: Moderate Al falsely elevates VFT in patients with severe AS undergoing AVR by partially inhibiting mitral valve opening. VFT may be an unreliable index of LV filling efficiency with competitive diastolic flow into the LV. Published by Elsevier Inc.	3.4
Laboratory-scale physical modelling was conducted to understand the behaviour of highway embankments constructed on peat foundations. Artificial transparent soil was used to simulate the deformation properties of the peat foundation. The use of a transparent soil allows the determination of spatial deformations underneath the modelled embankment using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The load-settlement behaviour in the field is reasonably simulated in the laboratory-scale physical model. This paper presents the results of a modelled embankment with a geotextile fabric across its base.	4.1
Conventional reflow method in a convection oven is the principal step during the package assembly process in order to guarantee high productivity and make full use of the self-alignment. The package behavior, especially warpage, has significant effects on assuring package assembly reliability during the reflow process. In recent decades, several techniques, like Shadow Moire or 3-D digital image correlation (DIC), have been developed to assist industry in characterizing warpage. The requirement of artificial speckles on the specimen surface inevitably reduces the measurement accuracy and contaminates the specimen. To improve the accuracy and keep the specimen clean, a novel in situ warpage measurement method without surface treatment is developed, and its result is demonstrated. The specimen can be reapplied to the manufacturing process after the measurement, and one sample can be assessed consistently at different assembly process steps instead of wasting samples at each assembly stage.	0.0
As one of the most developed intelligent operating systems on mobile devices, Android has taken the most part of the cell phone market. A rapid increase in the number of mobile applications make them more and more relevant to people's daily lives than ever before. Due to Android's security mechanism and the validation lack of publishing Android apps, Android malware detection still remains to be a critical issue. To solve this problem, this paper found that the statistical information of Android components (mainly activity) from the Manifest file cannot be ignored, based on the traditional method of Android permission detection. In this paper, a new feature vector is extracted from the AndroidManifest file, which combines the permission information and the component information of the Android application. We combine the naive Bias classification algorithm, and propose a malicious application detection method based on AndroidManifest file information. The experimental results show that the new method performance better than that of the traditional permission detection.	0.4
Metabolism cycles daily between the fed and fasted states. The pathways of energy production are reversible and distinct. In the anabolic (fed) state, the liver stores glucose as glycogen, and fatty acid/triglyceride synthesis is active. In the catabolic (fasted) state, the liver becomes a glucose producer, lipogenesis is slowed, and fatty acid oxidation/ketogenesis is activated. The rate-limiting step for the latter is vested in the carnitine/carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system, and the off/on regulator of this is malonyl CoA. The AMP-induced protein kinase primarily determines the concentration of malonyl CoA. Four other systems have significant influence: two on fatty acid oxidation and two on lipogenesis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-1alpha., a master regulator of metabolism, induces hepatic gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in the catabolic phase. Deficiency of stearoyl CoA desaturase, although having no role in gluconeogenesis, powerfully induces fatty acid oxidation and weight loss despite increased food intake in rodents. Major stimulators of lipogenesis are carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein and the Insig system. The malonyl CoA-regulated CPT system has been firmly established in humans. The other systems have not yet been confirmed in humans, but likely are active there as well. Activation of fatty acid oxidation has considerable clinical promise for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, steatohepatitis, and lipotoxic damage to the heart.	6.2
Communication between cortical regions is necessary for optimal cognitive processing. Functional relationships between cortical regions can be inferred through measurements of temporal synchrony in spontaneous activity patterns. These relationships can be further elaborated by surveying effects of cortical lesions upon inter-regional connectivity. Lesions to cortical hubs and heteromodal association regions are expected to induce distributed connectivity changes and higher-order cognitive deficits, yet their functional consequences remain relatively unexplored. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to investigate intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) and graph theoretical metrics in 12 patients with circumscribed lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) portion of the Default Network (DN), and compared these metrics with those observed in healthy matched comparison participants and a sample of 1139 healthy individuals. Despite significant mPFC destruction, patients did not demonstrate weakened intrinsic FC among undamaged DN nodes. Instead, network-specific changes were manifested as weaker negative correlations between the DN and attentional and somatomotor networks. These findings conflict with the DN being a homogenous system functionally anchored at mPFC. Rather, they implicate a role for mPFC in mediating cross-network functional interactions. More broadly, our data suggest that lesions to association cortical hubs might induce clinical deficits by disrupting communication between interacting large-scale systems.	2.1
Background: Human metabolism is an essential biological process that involves the consumption of different substrates to ensure the nutritional and energetic needs of cells. The disruption of this highly regulated system constitutes the onset of several disorders/dysfunctions such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Objective: In this review, we propose to discuss promising natural products that can act as modulators of cell metabolism and point towards possible targets to take into account in the development of new therapies against metabolic diseases. Methods: After having defined our main focus, we undertook an intensive search of bibliographic databases to select the peer-reviewed papers that fits within the review thematic. The information of the screened papers was described in an organized manner through the review and different types of studies were included. Results: Two hundred and seventy papers were included in the review, as well as one reliable website from the World Health Organization. Several articles described that pharmacological agents are commonly used to counteract metabolic disorders. However, in many cases these products are insufficient, represent high costs to health care systems and are associated with several undesirable effects, highlighting the need to search for new therapies. Notably, many papers reported the promising results of natural products in the treatment of several metabolic disorders, constituting a possible alternative or complementary strategy to pharmacological agents. Conclusion: The findings of this review confirm that the currently available treatments for metabolic disorders and its associated complications remain far below the expected results.	6.2
The People in My Life questionnaire (PIML) is one of the few available self-report measures for assessing children's representations of the relationship with attachment figures (parents and peers) in middle childhood. The current study presents validation studies of the PIML in a sample of Portuguese children aged between 8 and 12 years (N = 314) and adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years (N = 281). The original factor structure, composed of a second-order factor of attachment and three first-order factors (Trust, Communication, and Alienation), was confirmed for both scales (Parents Attachment and Peers Attachment) in the sample of children and replicated in the sample of adolescents using confirmatory factor analyses. The Portuguese version of the PIML showed adequate internal consistency and correlated as expected with measures of intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning (internalizing and externalizing problems, prosocial behavior, quality of life, self-compassion, and emotion regulation strategies). The PIML proved to be a psychometrically robust measure of children's representations of their relationships with parents and peers, representing an important advance in the measurement of attachment in middle childhood.	2.4
The main objective of this study was to configure the acquisition and analysis of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict physico-chemical characteristics of Iberian loin, evaluating the use of different MRI sequences (spin echo, SE; gradient echo, GE; turbo 3D, T3D), computational texture feature methods (GLCM, NGLDM, GLRLM, GLCM + NGLDM + GLRLM), and data mining techniques (multiple linear regression, MLR; isotonic regression, IR). Moderate to very good correlation coefficients and low mean absolute error were found when applying MLR or IR on any method of computational texture features from MRI acquired with SE or GE. For T3D sequence, accurate results are only obtained by applying IR on GLCM or GLCM + NGLDM + GLRLM methods. Considering not only the accuracy of the methodology but also consumed time and required resources, the use of SE sequences for MRI acquisition, GLCM method for MRI texture analysis, and MLR could be indicated for prediction physico-chemical characteristics of loin.	0.0
Charities often circulate widespread donation appeals, but who is most likely to donate and how do appeals impact the well-being of individual donors and non-donors, as well as the entire group exposed to the campaign? Here, we investigate three factors that may influence donations (recent winnings, the presence of another person, and matched earnings) in addition to the changes in affect reported by individuals who donate in response to a charitable opportunity and those who do not. Critically, we also investigate the change in affect reported by the entire sample to measure the net impact of the donation opportunity. Results reveal that people winning more money donate a smaller percentage to charity, and the presence of another person does not influence giving. In addition, large donors experience hedonic boosts from giving, and the substantial fraction of large donors translates to a net positive influence on well-being for the entire sample.	2.4
Road authorities in developing countries recognize the need to maintain unpaved roads in rural areas using local resource based approaches rather than by attempting to meet international standards. The authors have developed a novel road maintenance technique, that we call Do-nou. Since 2006, we have demonstrated this technique in Asia, the Pacific, Africa and Latin America. Do-nou can be classified as a geotextile used to reinforce the shear strength of soil using only plastic crop bags, which are widely available in developing countries, and unskilled local labor. After some modification, the technique was also applied to the maintenance of unpaved roads on the clayey ground and to the construction of retaining walls for road embankment in flood-prone areas. It was demonstrated that it was practical for the communities to maintain unpaved roads in rural areas when equipped with the Do-nou technique, thereby enhancing community resilience. The Kenyan Government has recognized the Donou technique in its road strategy plan and has invested in training its youth on this technique for employment promotion. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Ultraviolet spectrophotometry has been widely applied in determination of water quality parameters because of its advantagous properties compared to chemical method, such as high efficiency, easy operation and non-secondary pollutions. Nitrate nitrogen is one of major pollutants in waste water. The standard ultraviolet spectrophotometry used to determinate the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in water is firstly to determinate the absorbances at wavelength 220 and 275 nm, which is used to calibrate the former, followed by the plotting of standard curve. While the linear equation described by Lambert-Beer's law and the linearity in the superposition of absorbances of various substance, on which the standard ultraviolet spectrophotometry based, are not fitted well anymore with the increase of concentration. In addition, it was found to be difficult to construct absorption model of nitrate solution at wavelength 220 nm in experiment. To overcome the disadvantages in single-wavelength or double-wavalengths spectrophotometry, the absorbances at the wavelength that covered by the absorption peak are introduced into the construction of the model and to avoid the increase of the model complexification resulted by the introduction of more wavelengths, we run the principal components analysis on the original absorbances data. The data with dimensions compressed from 107 down to 4 after process construct the absorbance model using locally weighted linear regression. Good performance were achieved in both training samples set and test samples set using this model and it was able to deal with the non-linear relation between the absorbance and concentration thus raised the upper range limit concentrations of nitrate nitrogen up to hundreds mg . L-1 from 4 mg . L-1 defined in the standard method. Meanwhile the principle and procedure of this analytical method are suitable for the absorbance model construction of other solutions.	0.1
Non-destructive controls particularly, X-rays computed tomography (XR-CT) is a useful tool in manufacturing engineering applications in the modern industry to study the texture deformation of mechanical parts with an efficient way. In manufacturing processes, the relationships between the mechanical properties of the materials and their structure and also their composition are crucial for the design of the mechanical parts because they basically influence the general behaviour of these parts in service conditions. Therefore, the great interest of XR-CT is the possibility of viewing with high resolution a transversal plane of an object without destroying the controlled parts. Moreover, X-ray tomography supplants the ultra sound by its spatial resolution and by its attenuation measure which are well adapted for the study of the material. This paper gives a comparative study on the new developments in non-destructive controls of the composite materials and applications in the manufacturing engineering and also reviews essentially the performance and advantages of X-rays computed tomography (XR-CT) medical scanner about its usage at multiple scales (macro, micro, meso and nano), the method and also the terminology. Subsequently, it will deal with the chosen materials to share the performances of this technique for the very different industrial applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.	3.2
The first tool presented in this paper is a generic factory cost model that can estimate various costs at multiple levels of any manufacturing plant. The model is activity-based which means that the cost of each manufacturing operation is calculated and then summed up so that the true -per-hour pound factory cost rate as well as the exact unit cost (i.e. manufacturing cost) of an unlimited number of different components can be estimated. The second tool is a scalable cost model that estimates the unit cost of future integrally bladed disc (blisk) designs which are used by the aerospace industry in gas turbine compressors. The tool multiplies the machine cost rates, calculated by the factory cost model, by the operation times derived from blisk scaling rules. As the operation times often depend on the number of blades, the disc diameter and other design variables, many scaling rules are based on the correlation between operation times and certain design parameters. Conversely, the remaining process times are constant because they are independent of the blisk geometry. As future process times can only be estimated and the correlation between operation times and design parameters is never perfect, all operation times have uncertainty distributions. These are cascaded through the model to generate a probability distribution of the unit cost. Through the interactive exchange of detailed cost information at the manufacturing operation level as well as extrapolated operation times, the two cost models facilitate design and manufacturing engineering to concurrently optimise blisk designs and manufacturing processes in terms of cost.

People readily make personality attributions to images of strangers' faces. Here we investigated the basis of these personality attributions as made to everyday, naturalistic face images. In a first study, we used 1000 highly varying ambient image face photographs to test the correspondence between personality judgments of the Big Five and dimensions known to underlie a range of facial first impressions: approachability, dominance, and youthful-attractiveness. Interestingly, the facial Big Five judgments were found to separate to some extent: judgments of openness, extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness were mainly linked to facial first impressions of approachability, whereas conscientiousness judgments involved a combination of approachability and dominance. In a second study we used average face images to investigate which main cues are used by perceivers to make impressions of the Big Five, by extracting consistent cues to impressions from the large variation in the original images. When forming impressions of strangers from highly varying, naturalistic face photographs, perceivers mainly seem to rely on broad facial cues to approachability, such as smiling.	2.2
This article provides an estimate of the aggregate thickness required for unpaved roads resting on c-phi soil. Conventional practice of design of unpaved roads mostly considers the subgrade layer to be purely cohesive such as in soft marshy lands. However, a huge bulk of Indian sub-urban and rural unpaved roads rest on c-phi soil subgrade soil whose strength characteristics are contributed both by cohesion (c) and angle of internal friction (phi). It is imperative that if cohesion is considered as the sole strength criterion, it will provide lower bearing resistance, and hence, will overestimate the aggregate thickness required, which will eventually lead to undesirable increase in the overall project cost. In this regard, this article reports the result of an attempt made to identify the diminution in the required aggregate thickness of the unpaved road when both the strength characteristics of the subgrade soil are taken into account. Utility of a single geotextile layer beneath the aggregate has also been investigated towards further reduction of the required aggregate thickness. Incorporating bearing capacity estimation of the c-phi soil, necessary expressions have been developed for estimating the required aggregate thickness as a function of the axle load, tire inflation pressure, cohesion and angle of internal friction of subgrade soil, angle of internal friction and load distribution angle of the aggregate. Extended ranges of the aforementioned parameters, as suitable in Indian context, have been considered and the effect of the same, in the absence and presence of geotextiles, has been reported. Efficacy of the geotextiles has been elucidated in terms of the degree of improvement represented as reduction of aggregate thickness. Encouraging improvement up to the level of 70% has been observed in many instances. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	4.1
How do we decide who merits social status? According to functionalist theories of emotion, the nonverbal expressions of pride and shame play a key role, functioning as automatically perceived status signals. In this view, observers automatically make status inferences about expressers on the basis of these expressions, even when contradictory contextual information about the expressers' status is available. In four studies, the authors tested whether implicit and explicit status perceptions are influenced by pride and shame expressions even when these expressions' status-related messages are contradicted by contextual information. Results indicate that emotion expressions powerfully influence implicit and explicit status inferences, at times neutralizing or even overriding situational knowledge. These findings demonstrate the irrepressible communicative power of emotion displays and indicate that status judgments can be informed as much (and often more) by automatic responses to nonverbal expressions of emotion as by rational, contextually bound knowledge.	2.2
The geotextiles produced from meandrically arranged Kemafil ropes were prepared. The ropes were produced from textile waste materials: woollen nonwoven and nonwoven from the blend of recycled fibres. The ropes were arranged into segments which were used for the protection of the bank of the deep drainage ditch and reinforcement of shallow roadside ditch in the clay ground. The geotextiles were installed in the ground and their behaviour during one vegetation season was observed. It was stated that during heavy rains the meandrically arranged ropes form a system of micro-dams which slow down the stream of water flowing down on the surface of the ditch bank as well as the stream flowing along the ditch. The geotextiles installed on the ditch banks eliminate the formation of erosive channels and protect the banks against sliding. The geotextiles absorb water what ensures retention of water flowing along the ditch. Due to enhanced soil and water holding capacity geotextiles protect grass seeds from being washed out and facilitate the development of protective vegetation. Materials used for the production of the ropes reveal sufficient resistance to biological degradation. Slow biodegradation of the materials enable keeping the protective potential of geotextiles for at least one vegetation season. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.1
Two-phase gas-solids transport models are widely utilized for process design and automation in a broad range of industrial applications. Some of these applications include proppant transport in gaseous fracking fluids, air/gas drilling hydraulics, coal-gasification reactors and food processing units. Systems automation and real time process optimization stand to benefit a great deal from availability of efficient and accurate theoretical models for operations data processing. However, modeling two-phase pneumatic transport systems accurately requires a comprehensive understanding of gas-solids flow behavior. In this study we discuss the prevailing flow conditions and present a low-fidelity two-fluid model equation for particulate transport. The model equations are formulated in a manner that ensures the physical flux term remains conservative despite the inclusion of solids normal stress through the empirical formula for modulus of elasticity. A new set of Roe-Pike averages are presented for the resulting strictly hyperbolic flux term in the system of equations, which was used to develop a Roe-type approximate Riemann solver. The resulting scheme is stable regardless of the choice of flux-limiter. The model is evaluated by the prediction of experimental results from both pneumatic riser and air-drilling hydraulics systems. We demonstrate the effect and impact of numerical formulation and choice of numerical scheme on model predictions. We illustrate the capability of a low-fidelity one-dimensional two-fluid model in predicting relevant flow parameters in two-phase particulate systems accurately even under flow regimes involving counter-current flow.

Open-circle sea water hydraulics, utilizing surrounding water as a working medium, has become more and more popular in submersible. Axial piston pump with port valves is used frequently in the open-circle water hydraulic system. Port valve is one of the important parts in this type pump. However, there are few literatures about the effect of the port valves' materials on the noise characteristic of the water pump. In this study, the effect of materials on the noise of the pump was researched through experimental and theory simulation methods. The influences of three kinds of plastics (Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Aliphatic polyamides (NYLON)) and one kind of anti-corrosion stainless steel (316 L) are colimared. The noise of the pump with the different materials port valve seat ranges from high to low as the order: 316 L >NYLON >PEEK >PTFE. The differences would contribute to the collision between valve spool and seat, which is identified by the simulating results. The experimental results showed that the difference of noise between PEEK and PTFE is small. In addition, the lifespan and volumetric efficiency are also taken into considering. The PEEK is selected to use in the seawater pump for a large submersible.	3.1
In the design of revetment engineering under wave action, to resist the wave action, the pattern of Top layer - Filter layer - Core(subsoil) is often adopted. In general, the structure of top layer is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs where with smaller waves. Such top layer has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. Setting a filter layer between the top layer and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil being rushed out. This paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. By simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, The pressure of top of cover layer and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of top layer is studyed. The research shows that when the lower coarse aggregate under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile's permeability get poorer, the uplift force to the top layer will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the top layer when it si greater than the vertical component force of the block gravity under the water.

Water flow through porous media is involved with physical factors such as size and configuration of pores, contact angle of grain surface, and connectivity of pores. To deal with these factors, pore-scale modeling is essential. Pore aggregate referred to as pore-network is extracted from randomly packed spherical grains with the modified Delaunay tessellation method. Water flow in a pore-network is formulated in terms of a network flow problem in hydraulics, in which friction and local losses such as contraction and enlargement of pipes are explicitly treated, while those are implicitly included in the hydraulic conductance of capillary tubes in existing works. Through the numerical experiments, it was confirmed that the effect of the local loss on the hydraulic conductivity could be negligible. Furthermore, the relative permeabilities of porous media with mixed wettabilities along the primary drainage and imbibition processes were estimated.	3.1
Earth Observation data is of great interest for a wide spectrum of scientific domain applications. An enhanced access to remote sensing images for domain experts thus represents a great advance since it allows users to interpret remote sensing images based on their domain expert knowledge. However, such an advantage can also turn into a major limitation if this knowledge is not formalized, and thus is difficult for it to be shared with and understood by other users. In this context, knowledge representation techniques such as ontologies should play a major role in the future of remote sensing applications. We implemented an ontology-based prototype to automatically classify Landsat images based on explicit spectral rules. The ontology is designed in a very modular way in order to achieve a generic and versatile representation of concepts we think of utmost importance in remote sensing. The prototype was tested on four subsets of Landsat images and the results confirmed the potential of ontologies to formalize expert knowledge and classify remote sensing images.	4.2
Data concerning the occurrence of emerging biological contaminants such as antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in aquatic environments in Sub-Saharan African countries is limited. On the other hand, antibiotic resistance remains a worldwide problem which may pose serious potential risks to human and animal health. Consequently, there is a growing number of reports concerning the prevalence and dissemination of these contaminants into various environmental compartments. Sediments provide the opportunity to reconstruct the pollution history and evaluate impacts so this study investigates the abundance and distribution of toxic metals. FIB, and ARGs released from hospital effluent wastewaters and their presence in river sediments receiving systems. ARGs (b/a(TEM), bla(CTX-M), bia(SHv), and aadA), total bacterial load, and selected bacterial species FIB [Escherichia coil, Enterococcus (ENT)] and species (Psd) were quantified by targeting species specific genes using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in total DNA extracted from the sediments recovered from 4 hospital outlet pipes (HOP) and their river receiving systems in the City of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The results highlight the great concentration of toxic metals in HOP, reaching the values (in mg kg(-1)) of 47.9 (Cr), 213.6 (Cu), 1434.4 (Zn), 2.6 (Cd), 281.5 (Pb), and 13.6 (Hg). The results also highlight the highest (P < 0.05) values of 16S rRNA, FIB, and ARGs copy numbers in all sampling sites including upstream (control site), discharge point, and downstream of receiving rivers, indicating that the hospital effluent water is not an exclusive source of the biological contaminants entering the urban rivers. Significant correlation were observed between (i) all analyzed ARGs and total bacterial load (16S rRNA) 0.51 to 0.72 (p < 0.001, n = 65); (ii) ARGs (except bla(TEM) and FIB and Psd 0.57 < r < 0.82 (p < 0.001, n = 65); and (iii) ARGs (except bla(TEM) and toxic metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, and Zn) 0.44 to 0.72, (p < 0.001, n = 65). These findings demonstrate that several sources including hospital and urban wastewaters contribute to the spread of toxic metals and biological emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.	4.4
Background: These studies were carried out to examine whether the onset and progression of an opioid substance use disorder (SUD) differed in those who first used opioids to get high compared to those who received a prescription from a doctor to relieve pain (Non-Rx vs. Rx groups, respectively). Methods: A subset of patients (N = 214) from an ongoing larger study of patients entering one of 125 drug treatment programs for opioid use disorder across the country agreed to give up their anonymity and participate in structured and open-ended online interviews examining drug abuse patterns. Results: With the exception that the Non-Rx group began their opioid abuse at a younger age than the Rx group and more quickly evolved from initial exposure to regular opioid abuse, there were relatively few differences in the characteristics, patterns and trajectories of opioid abuse. The vast majority of patients in both groups, most of whom had serious, antecedent psychiatric disorders, indicated that they used opioids to self-medicate psychological problems (67-73%) and/or stated that opioids provided a means to escape from the stresses of everyday life (79-85%). As the SUD progressed, for many individuals any positive attributes of opioids waned and avoidance of withdrawal became the overriding concern, often serving as the impetus for treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that self-treatment of co-morbid psychiatric disturbances is a powerful motivating force to initiate and sustain abuse of opioids and that the initial source of drugs a prescription or experimentation is largely irrelevant in the progression to a SUD.

We present a new scheme on implementing the passive quantum key distribution with thermal distributed parametric down-conversion source. In this scheme, only one-intensity decoy state is employed, but we can achieve very precise estimation on the single-photon-pulse contribution by utilizing those built-in decoy states. Moreover, we compare the new scheme with other practical methods, i.e., the standard three-intensity decoy-state BB84 protocol using either weak coherent states or parametric down-conversion source. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our new scheme can drastically improve both the secure transmission distance and the key generation rate.	0.3
There are many water-related human interventions that modify the natural hydrological systems of watersheds. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is such an intervention that involves harnessing of water. Water harvesting used in upstream prevents surface runoff to downstream impacting biodiversity and ecosystems. The main objective of the study is to assess the effects of water harvesting technologies on downstream water availability in Alaba District, Ethiopia. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, cost-benefit ratio, and optimal control approach (OCA) were used to analyze the hydrological, socioeconomic impact and trade-offs on water availability of the community, respectively. The downstream impact of increasing water consumption in the upstream rainfed areas of the Bilate and Shala watershed is simulated using the semi-distributed SWAT model. The two land use scenarios tested at sub-basin levels for the conventional land use represent the current land use practice (Agri-CON) and infield rainwater harvesting (IRWH) for improving soil water availability through RWH land use scenario. The simulated water balance results showed that the highest peak mean monthly direct flow was obtained from Agri-CON land use (12.71 m(3)/ha), followed by Agri-IRWH land use (11.5 m(3)/ha). The Agri-IRWH scenario reduced direct flow by 10 % compared to Agri-CON and more groundwater flow contributed by Agri-IRWH (190 m(3)/ha) than Agri-CON (125 m(3)/ha). The overall result suggests that the water yield of the area may not be negatively affected by the Agri-IRWH land use scenario. The technology in the district benefited positively having an average cost-benefit ratio of 4.2. Storage tanks, series of check dams, and gravel filled dams are alternative solutions for water harvesting.	4.3
Objective: To explore validity of an assessment tool under development the Emotional Inferencing from Stories Test (EIST). This measure is being designed to assess the ability of people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) to make inferences about the emotional state of others solely from contextual cues. Methods and procedures: Study 1: 25 stories were presented to 40 healthy young adults. From this data, two versions of the EIST (EIST-1; EIST-2) were created. Study 2: Each version was administered to a group of participants with moderate-to-severe TBI EIST 1 group: 77 participants; EIST-2 group: 126 participants. Participants also completed a facial affect recognition (DANVA2-AF) test, Participants with facial affect recognition impairment returned 2 weeks later and were re-administered both tests. Main outcomes: Participants with TBI scored significantly lower than the healthy group mean for EIST-1, F(1,114) = 68.49, p<0.001, and EIST-2, F(1,163)=177.39, p<0.001. EIST scores in the EIST-2 group were significantly lower than the EIST-1 group, t=4.47, p<0.001. DANVA2-AF scores significantly correlated with EIST scores, EIST-1: r=0.50, p<0.001; EIST-2: r=0.31, p<0.001. Test-re-test reliability scores for the EIST were adequate. Conclusions: Both versions of the EIST were found to be sensitive to deficits in emotional inferencing. After further development, the EIST may provide clinicians valuable information for intervention planning.	2.3
The water clocks of the 12th-century Islamic scientist Ismail Al-Jazari may be regarded as among the most outstanding engineering masterpieces in the history of science and technology in Persia. His other works testify to his remarkable ability in design methodology and in different aspects of mechanical engineering design and manufacture such as robotics, fluid mechanics, strength of materials, and statics. In this study in experimental archaeology two of his water clocks - namely the dragon clock and the peacock clock - were considered for the purposes of making working reconstructions. The historical background, design details, and a technical and comparative analysis of these inventions are presented here. Replicas were constructed in accordance with the indications provided in Al-Jazari's A Compendium on the Theory and Practice of the Mechanical Arts and tests have shown that both clocks operated exactly as described in his book, and with an acceptable degree of precision.	3.4
The manufacturing engineering of bamboo fiber reinforced friction material was introduced in this paper. ANSYS was used to do adaptive meshing and establish the contact, impose constraints load and solve, then the temperature field of bamboo fiber reinforced friction material was obtained. The results showed that under the coupling effect of friction heat and pressure, Brake blocks and brake discs in the contact area showed local changes in temperature and stress characteristics. The thermal stress of coupled parts contact surface showed a inhomogeneous distribution. Contact pressure distribution and temperature distribution interact each other, the contact pressure distribution of the coupled parts affects the temperature distribution, and the local feature of temperature distribution of the coupled parts conversely affects the contact pressure distribution. It will provide an important theoretical basis for devising friction brake and selecting material of the friction pair.	3.2
This paper focuses on the design and experimental test results of a belt-driven starter generator for 48-V mini-hybrid powertrains. The functionalities required of the system are engine startup, launch assistant torque, regenerative braking, battery charging, and early fuel cutoff. The cost-effective electrical machine must provide high starting torque and wide constant power speed range, both in motor and generator modes. The authors outline the motivations of the electrical machine topology selection in relation to the specifications and constraints. In particular, a double three-phase induction machine has been selected as a suitable candidate. The aim of this paper is to summarize the design challenges of such kind of electrical machines, mainly subordinated to electromechanical and thermal issues imposed by the considered hybridization solution. Details of the machine design are presented, including a study on multilayer bar stator windings and on rotor slot design. Finally, predicted and measured performances of the prototype are reported and discussed for validation purposes.	3.3
The main objective of this paper is to propose an alternative for the stormwater management in low-income communities, settled in urban vertical slums, located in areas with insufficient infrastructure and degraded environment. A case study located in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil, is presented. The high slopes of the studied area are used to favor the superficial flows, generating alternatives for the traditional stormdrains used to collect the runoff of the upstream reaches. A small reservoir is proposed for each house, reducing flood volumes by allowing rainwater harvesting, and a greater retention reservoir is introduced as a storage measure for connecting the microdrainage coming from the informal city to the formal city. The different scenarios were simulated with the aid of a mathematical model called MODCEL and the results showed that it is possible to apply an effective drainage system solution in informal areas, without affecting the already implemented downstream formal drainage network. The retention reservoir proposed also introduces the possibility to act in improving the water quality to downstream areas, although this complementary aspect is not developed in this study.	4.3
The limited number of oral vaccines currently approved for use in humans and veterinary species clearly illustrates that development of efficacious and safe oral vaccines has been a challenge not only for fish immunologists. The insufficient efficacy of oral vaccines is partly due to antigen breakdown in the harsh gastric environment, but also to the high tolerogenic gut environment and to inadequate vaccine design. In this review we discuss current approaches used to develop oral vaccines for mass vaccination of farmed fish species. Furthermore, using various examples from the human and veterinary vaccine development, we propose additional approaches to fish vaccine design also considering recent advances in fish mucosal immunology and novel molecular tools. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of using the zebrafish as a pre-screening animal model to potentially speed up vaccine design and testing for aquaculture fish species. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the stability of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and prefabricated abutment by measuring removal torque before and after cyclic loading. Materials and Methods: Three types of fixture and 2 types of abutments were used. Removable torque was measured after cyclic loading for 5000 cycles between 25 and 250 N for each group. The same procedure was performed twice. Results: First, removal torque values (Newton centimeter) were measured for stock versus custom abutments as follows: group 1: 27.17 versus 26.67, group 2: 26.27 versus 26.33, and group 3: 37.33 versus 36.67. Second removal torque values (Newton centimeter) were also measured: group 1: 23 versus 23.5, group 2: 22.5 versus 22.33, and group 3: 32.67 versus 32.5. There was no significant difference between the stock and custom abutments in either the first or second removal torque values and also no significant difference among initial tightening torque, first or second removal torque (P >0.05). Conclusion: With precise control of CAD/CAM abutments, good screw joint stability can be achieved.	3.0
Inherited genetic variants contribute to risk factors for developing an alcohol use disorder, and polymorphisms may inform precision medicine strategies for treating alcohol addiction. Targeting genetic mutations linked to alcohol phenotypes has provided promising initial evidence for reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. Although successful in some studies, there are conflicting findings and the reports of adverse effects may ultimately limit their clinical utility, suggesting that novel pharmacogenetic targets are necessary to advance precision medicine approaches. Here, we describe promising novel genetic variants derived from preclinical models of alcohol consumption and dependence that may uncover disease mechanisms that drive uncontrolled drinking and identify novel pharmacogenetic targets that facilitate therapeutic intervention for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.	5.0
The performance of onsite rainwater harvesting (RWH) system in Mediterranean climate was assessed. A stochastic model quantifying the necessary storage, as a function of rainfall (frequency, depth), roof area, residents' number, specific water use (toilet flushing, laundry) and the required efficiency was developed. Two performance indicators were calculated: water saving efficiency (RSE) - proportion of water used supplied by the RWH system; and rainwater use efficiency (RUE) proportion of rainwater actually used. The maximum storage capacity and WSE decreased with increasing number of residents for a given roof area, and with an increasing roof area for constant number of residents. For variable storage volume, RUE increased with increasing storage capacity and reached a maximum with an increase in residents' number and a decrease in the roof area. The model enables to determine WSE and RUE for specific storage volumes or to determine the desired WSE and calculate the necessary storage.	4.3
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) has been recognized as an important cause of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the two most prominent neurodegenerative diseases causing memory impairment in the elderly. However, an effective therapy for CCH-induced memory impairment has not yet been established. Grape seed polyphenol extract (GSPE) has powerful antioxidant properties and protects neurons and glia during ischemic injury, but its potential use in the prevention of CCH-induced memory impairment has not yet been investigated. Here, CCH-related memory impairment was modeled in rats using permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery. A Morris water maze task was used to evaluate memory, the levels of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholine were used to evaluate cholinergic function, and oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, malonic dialdehyde, and catalase. We found that oral administration of GSPE for 1 month can rescue memory deficits. We also found that GSPE restores cholinergic neuronal function and represses oxidative damage in the hippocampus of CCH rats. We propose that GSPE protects memory in CCH rats by reducing ischemia-induced oxidative stress and cholinergic dysfunction. These findings provide a novel application of GSPE in CCH-related memory impairments. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
Four black fly species of the Simulium striatum species group have been recorded in Thailand. These species are morphologically highly similar in all developmental stages except for the number and arrangement of the pupal gill filaments. In this study, we used multiple characters sources, including morphology, cytology, molecular biology and ecology, to test the hypothesis of conspecificity for S. quinquestriatum (Shiraki), S. nakhonense Takaoka & Suzuki and S. chiangmaiense Takaoka & Suzuki. A molecular study based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was unable to separate these taxa. In contrast, the elongation complex protein 1 (ECP1) sequences clearly differentiate S. quinquestriatum from S. chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense. However, the latter two taxa could not be differentiated based on molecular DNA sequences. Simulium chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense are also similar in the larval habitat characteristics and have undifferentiated polytene chromosome banding patterns. Morphological examination of the number and arrangement of the pupal gill filaments found a number of intermediate forms. Therefore, S. chiangmaiense and S. nakhonense are apparently the same biological species that is polymorphic for the number and arrangement of gill filaments. Thus, we synonymized S. chiangmaiense with S. nakhonense.	6.0
Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is a process for predicting spatially the land cover classes within mixed pixels. In existing SPM methods, the effect of point spread function (PSF) has seldom been considered. In this paper, a generic SPM method is developed to consider the PSF effect in SPM and, thereby, to increase prediction accuracy. We first demonstrate that the spectral unmixing predictions (i.e., coarse land cover proportions used as input for SPM) are a convolution of not only sub-pixels within the coarse pixel, but also sub-pixels from neighboring coarse pixels. Based on this finding, a new SPM method based on optimization is developed which recognizes the optimal solution as the one that when convolved with the PSF, is the same as the input coarse land cover proportion. Experimental results on three separate datasets show that the SPM accuracy can be increased by considering the PSF effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	4.2
We consider the problem of how to design and implement communication-efficient versions of parallel kernel support vector machines, a widely used classifier in statistical machine learning, for distributed memory clusters and supercomputers. The main computational bottleneck is the training phase, in which a statistical model is built from an input data set. Prior to our study, the parallel isoefficiency of a state-of-the-art implementation scaled as W = Omega(P-3), where W is the problem size and P the number of processors; this scaling is worse than even a one-dimensional block row dense matrix vector multiplication, which has W = Omega(P-2). This study considers a series of algorithmic refinements, leading ultimately to a Communication-Avoiding SVM method that improves the isoefficiency to nearly W = Omega(P). We evaluate these methods on 96 to 1,536 processors, and show average speedups of 3 - 16 x ( 7 x on average) over Dis-SMO, and a 95 percent weak-scaling efficiency on six real-world datasets, with only modest losses in overall classification accuracy.

Water-borne diseases have been estimated to cause more than two million deaths and four billion cases of diarrhea annually. Water-borne pathogenic organisms include bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Heavy metal contamination of water is also a potential threat to human health. This study aimed to detect contamination of potable water with protozoal and bacterial pathogens as well as heavy metals in Gharbiya governorate in the middle of the Nile Delta, Egypt. Therefore, this study was conducted on water samples from 3 different localities in Gharbiya governorate throughout the year 2014. Water samples (108) were collected from source, plant and tap water at the four seasons. Parasitological, bacteriological, and toxicological evaluation was carried out for all samples. Parasitological evaluation was done to detect protozoal contamination by conventional diagnostic staining techniques, immunofluorescence assay, and flow cytometry. The study identified the protozoal contaminants in water, and showed that flow cytometry positive results were more than the conventional staining. Also, the study identified bacterial fecal contamination of source water as well as heavy metal pollution in source water. Since the integration of flow cytometry could facilitate detection of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples, we strongly recommend its use as a routine for the detection of these pathogenic protozoa. Finally, Ongoing evaluation of drinking water is needed as well as formulation and implementation of an integrated plan to limit the contamination by pathogens and heavy metals.

Importance: The etiology of recurrent croup is often anatomic. Currently there is no set criteria for determining who should undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy and which patients are at most risk for having a clinically significant finding. Few studies have addressed these questions. Objective: To identify risk factors for clinically significant findings on bronchoscopy in children with recurrent croup and the frequency of bronchoscopy findings in general. Data sources: PUBMED, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE. Study selection: Articles addressing bronchoscopy in children with recurrent croup, up to July 2016, were reviewed. Related keywords and medical subject headings were used during the search. The abstracts were reviewed to determine suitability for inclusion based on a set of criteria. Manual crosscheck of references was performed. Data extraction: We analyzed the bronchoscopy findings of individual patients in each study and their associated risk factors when available. Results: We reviewed 11 articles, published between 1992 and 2016, including 885 patients (654 males, 237 females). Only 5 studies, including 455 patients, had sufficient data for meta-analysis. Our study revealed that the three most common bronchoscopy findings were subglottic stenosis, reflux changes, and broncho/tracheomalacia. Only 8.7% of patients were noted to have clinically significant findings on bronchoscopy. Meta analysis showed an association between significant bronchoscopy findings and History of Intubation [OR = 5.17, 95% CI 2.65-10.09], Inpatient Consultation [OR = 4.01, 95% CI 1.44 -11.20], Age < 3 [OR = 3.22, 95% 1.66-6.27], Age < 1 [OR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.28-6.40], and Prematurity [OR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.39-6.06]. Our study found a high incidence of a History of GERD (20%) and Asthma/Allergies (35%) among patients with recurrent croup, but these variables did not reach statistical significance in patients with significant bronchoscopy findings ([OR = 1.62, 95% CI 0.79-3.30], [OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.30-1.08] respectively). Conclusion: The risk factors most associated with clinically significant bronchoscopy findings in recurrent croup are Intubation, Inpatient Consultation, Age < 3, Age <1, and Prematurity. A History of GERD and Asthma/Allergy, though highly prevalent in recurrent croup patients, were not statistically associated with significant bronchoscopy findings. Relevance: The results should guide physicians in selecting which recurrent croup patients are most at risk for significant findings and thus may warrant bronchoscopy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

When do children acquire a propositional attitude folk psychology or theory of mind? The orthodox answer to this central question of developmental ToM research had long been that around age 4 children begin to apply belief and other propositional attitude concepts. This orthodoxy has recently come under serious attack, though, from two sides: Scoffers complain that it over-estimates children's early competence and claim that a proper understanding of propositional attitudes emerges only much later. Boosters criticize the orthodoxy for underestimating early competence and claim that even infants ascribe beliefs. In this paper, the orthodoxy is defended on empirical grounds against these two kinds of attacks. On the basis of new evidence, not only can the two attacks safely be countered, but the orthodox claim can actually be strengthened, corroborated and refined: what emerges around age 4 is an explicit, unified, flexibly conceptual capacity to ascribe propositional attitudes. This unified conceptual capacity contrasts with the less sophisticated, less unified implicit forms of tracking simpler mental states present in ontogeny long before. This refined version of the orthodoxy can thus most plausibly be spelled out in some form of 2-systems-account of theory of mind.	2.1
Intergroup contact theory has been empirically supported in a variety of social contexts, but few samples have been drawn from rapidly developing nations undergoing severe political and sociocultural conflict. Using 2012 Caucasus Barometer data from the three nations of the South Caucasus Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia we test the effect of interreligious contact on various forms of out-group resistance in a region of the world that is both historically and presently marked with severe religious and ethnic conflict. Additionally, we take into account self-selection effects using propensity score matching. Results overwhelmingly support intergroup contact theory in all three countries, but objections toward intermarriage still remain high for treated groups. In addition, there exist significant differences based on the out-group studied, with the contact effects being the strongest for groups posing little religio-cultural or organized threat. Weaker contact effects, though, appear less related to threat and more contextual/out-group specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	2.0
This study aims to conduct the nonlinearity analysis of the shading effect on the technical-economic performance of the building-integrated photovoltaic blind (BIPB), which is designed as a preliminary study to evaluate the feasibility of the BIPB before its implementation. First, in terms of the technical performance of the BIPB, the shading effect due to the blind's slat in the BIPB can have a nonlinear effect on the amount of electricity generation per unit area (AEGunit) from the BIPB. Particularly, as the width of the PV panel increases, the AEG(unit) from the BIPB tends to decrease. Second, in terms of the economic performance of the BIPB, the feasibility of the BIPB depends on the type of investment values. Specifically, as' the width of the PV panel increases, the NPV25 (net present value at year 25) tends to increase; however, the SIR25 (saving-to-investment ratio at year 25) tends to decrease. That is, while the NPV25 is determined to be highest at US$82,869 when the width of the PV panel is 50 mm, the SIR25 is determined to be highest at 2.90 times when the width of the PV panel is 10 mm. The main findings of this study can be used to clearly define the design specifications of the BIPB before its implementation, which ensure to meet the client expectations on various objectives, such as technical performance (e.g., the AEG(unit) from the BIPB) and economic performance (e.g., NPV25 and SIR25).

Glass fiber-reinforced composite materials are finding numerous applications in many engineering and domestic fields due to their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Among the machining processes used, drilling is one of the most important processes and is mainly used in joining of composite structures. Maintaining of proper surface roughness in drilled holes is very important and is to be controlled. In the present work prediction of surface roughness in drilling of composite materials is carried out using fuzzy logic. In recent years, fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence has been used in manufacturing engineering for modeling and monitoring. An L27 orthogonal array is used for experimentation. A fuzzy rule-based model is developed to predict the surface roughness in drilling of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites. Good agreement is observed between the model results and experimental values. The analysis of experimental results is carried out using Pareto analysis of variance (Pareto-ANOVA) and ANOVA and presented in detail.	3.2
Background: A laboratory-scale two-chamber microbial fuel cell employing an aerated cathode with no catalyst was inoculated with mixed inoculum and acetate as the carbon source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the behavior of the MFC during initial biofilm (week 1) and maximum power density (week 20). EIS were performed on the anode chamber, biofilm (without anolyte) and anolyte (without biofilm). Nyquist plots of the EIS data were fitted with two equivalent electrical circuits to estimate the contributions of intrinsic resistances to the overall internal MFC impedance at weeks 1 and 20, respectively. Results: The results showed that the system tended to increase power density from 15 +/- 3 (week 1) to 100 +/- 15 mW/m(2) (week 20) and current density 211 +/- 7 (week 1) to 347 +/- 29 mA/m(2) (week 20). The Samples were identified by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and showed that initial inoculum (week 1) was constituted by Proteobacteria (40%), Bacteroidetes (22%) and Firmicutes (18%). At week 20, Proteobacterial species were predominant (60%) for electricity generation in the anode biofilm, being 51% Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Meanwhile on anolyte, Firmicutes phylum was predominant with Bacillus sp. This study proved that under the experimental conditions used there is an important contribution from the interaction of the biofilm and the anolyte on cell performance. Table 1 presents a summary of the specific influence of each element of the system under study. Conclusions: The results showed certain members of the bacterial electrode community increased in relative abundance from the initial inoculum. For example, Proteobacterial species are important for electricity generation in the anode biofilms and Firmicutes phylum was predominant on anolyte to transfer electron. R1 is the same in the three systems and no variation is observed over time. The biofilm makes a significant contribution to the charge transfer processes at the electrode (R2 and Cdl) and, consequently, on the performance of the anode chamber. The biofilm can act as a barrier which reduces diffusion of the anolyte towards the electrode, all the while behaving like a porous material. The anolyte and its interaction with the biofilm exert a considerable influence on diffusion processes, given that it presents the highest values for Rd which increased at week 20.	1.2
Selective laser melting (SLM) process, an additive manufacturing (AM) technology, has had a rapid growth in the biomedical and aerospace markets because of the ability to manufacture complex designs directly from computer-aided design (CAD) using materials such as titanium and aluminum alloys. Although this technology allows designers to fabricate geometries not achievable with conventional manufacturing, it has some restrictions. The paper presents the technological problems and restrictions resulting in the production of structures in aluminum alloy by SLM. In particular, it analyzed the input file of the process, .STL file, and the dimensional limits of geometries with sharp edges as a simple parallelepiped with a square base since the understanding of the limitations can help the designer in the creation of new components. The creation of function-independent design rules, easily transferrable on individual part designs, could allow a wide industrial usage and a better knowledge of AM technologies. The results presented in this paper showed that the choice of parameters of conversion from the CAD model to .STL file could be a restriction for the software for preprocessing part but also affects the surface roughness. Moreover, if a SLM machine with a laser beam of 100 mu m is used, it is not possible to produce geometries with sharp edges with size base below 0.8 mm in an aluminum alloy.	3.0
The paper sets out to explore the possibility that citizen-led surveys provide a better coverage of populations and specifically of hard-to-reach poorer areas than the international standardized household surveys which are the basis for many of the estimates used in assessing progress toward meeting the MDGs and will be for the SDGs. This hypothesis is based on the argument that, the local volunteer enumerators of citizen-led surveys are likely to be more sensitive to the specificities of local population distribution and (recent) changes than those centrally trained; and may be more effective at reaching hard-to reach groups such as those nomadic groups and those in urban slums. To test the hypothesis, the results of UWEZO (meaning capability) surveys have been compared at a regional level with those of contemporaneous DHS surveys in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda for estimates of access to water and electricity. Overall, at national level, we find that UWEZO estimates for access to clean water were lower at a statistically significant level than those of DHS and these differences were statistically significant at the 0.01% level; in particular, the DHS values were much higher in regions where there are high concentrations of nomads and of urban slums, implying that the UWEZO surveys catch more poverty. The suggestion therefore is that citizen surveys such as UWEZO provide better, and more accurate, coverage of the poorest of the poor. Using the lowest estimate of the percentage missing in urban slums and extrapolating to all developing countries, there are an estimated 369 million missing from the sampling frames of standardized household surveys worldwide. This has important implications for the Leave no one behind appeal of the UN Secretary General and for the UN's Data Revolution. Some suggestions are made about how to progress improved population estimates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.0
Simplify deployment and maintenance of Ambient Intelligence solutions is important to enable large-scale deployment and maximize the use/benefit of these solutions. More mature Ambient Intelligence solutions emerge on the market as a result of an intensive investment in research. This research targets mainly the accuracy, usefulness, and usability aspects of the solutions. Still, possibility to adapt to different environments, ease of deployment and maintenance are ongoing problems of Ambient Intelligence. Existing solutions require an expert to move on-site in order to install or maintain systems. Therefore, we present in this paper our attempt to enable quick large scale deployment. We discuss lessons learned from our approach for automating the deployment process in order to be performed by ordinary people. We also introduce a solution for simplifying the monitoring and maintenance of installed systems.	4.0
The main issues related to water conservation in urban centers are the increase in water supply cost, demand growth, pollution and differences in the distribution of water resources. Water conservation, the controlled and efficient use of water, includes both measures as reasonable means of water reuse. Thus, conservation practices are an effective way to meet demand and supply water to new activities and users without jeopardizing the supplying water bodies and preserving the natural environment. This study aims to examine the water management of a shopping mall, the use of rainwater harvesting combined with greywater reuse, to investigate the feasibility of these water reuse systems. For buildings in general, water loss is common due to leaks in the hydraulic and restroom equipment. These losses, which are caused by a high volume of water used and wasted in the system, are often the result of design errors, incorrect maintenance procedures and users' bad habits. In southern Brazil, where there is an abundance of rainwater, water shortages occasionally occur, particularly in the winter. One difficulty that appears on rainwater studies is the proper determination of rainwater volume that can be used to address water supply systems. In this work, the simulation method was used to determine this volume. Thus, simulations with the following variables: rainfall, catchment area and water consumption were performed. For mall's hydraulic systems, segmented alternatives are adopted. That is, focusing on the use of rainwater or greywater reuse. Other alternatives are underutilized due to sanitary issues, those are water from toilets and kitchen sinks. The adoption of greywater may be feasible if there is a significant flow of greywater to comply water demand for toilet flushing. The inspections made in this study found that the quantity of sinks was insufficient to supply an adequate amount of water to toilets and urinals. The greywater reuse system was found to be infeasible. Conversely, the rainwater harvesting system was entirely feasible and easily supplied water to all restrooms and contributed to the cooling of the air conditioning system with a short payback period. One of the challenges of this work was the need to compare the actual water consumption with a water consumption parameter used in buildings. Thus, a method that addresses the generation of specific consumption indexes for specific activity (like a mall) was used. The water consumption indices showed that this mall has a satisfactory water management program. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.3
There has been little focus on nonverbal communication in social media advertising campaigns. We propose that specific patterns of facial expressions predict the popularity of YouTube videos among users of social media. To test that proposition, we used a neuromarketing tool-FaceReader-to code facial videos of professional speakers who participated in the YouTube social media campaigns of 2 large commercial banks. We analyzed more than 25,000 video frames of 16 speakers' 6 basic facial expressions. We found that less incidence of affiliative facial emotions (happiness and sadness) and more incidence of nonemotional expressions (surprise) explained an additional 25% of variance (from 61% to 86%) in the video's popularity (number of YouTube views) after 8 months in t2 (July 14, 2015), in comparison to t1 (October 31, 2014) as the only baseline predictor. We further showed that the disaffiliative facial emotions of the speakers (anger, fear, and disgust) did not contribute as an indicator of the future performance of social media content. We hope that these findings will open new lines of research in corporate communication by incorporating neuromarketing and nonverbal communication to understand not only what content is effective but how it should be presented.	2.3
Purpose: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been associated with large incidence of ischemic events, whose sources are still unclear. In fact, sub-acute complications cannot be directly related to the severity of the calcification in the host tissues, nor with catheter manipulation during the implant. A potential cause could be local flow perturbations introduced by the implantation approach, resulting in thrombo-embolic consequences. In particular, contrary to the surgical approach, TAVI preserves the presence of the native leaflets, which are expanded in the paravalvular space inside the Valsalva sinuses. The purpose of this study is to verify if this configuration can determine hemodynamic variations which may promote blood cell aggregation and thrombus formation. Methods: The study was performed in vitro, on idealized models of the patient anatomy before and after TAVI, reproducing a range of physiological operating conditions on a pulse duplicator. The fluid dynamics in the Valsalva sinuses was analyzed and characterized using phase resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. Results: Comparison of the flow downstream the valve clearly indicated major alterations in the fluid mechanics after TAVI, characterized by unphysiological conditions associated with extended stagnation zones at the base of the sinuses. Conclusion: The prolonged stasis observed in the Valsalva sinuses for the configuration modelling the presence of transcatheter aortic valves provides a fluid dynamic environment favourable for red blood cell aggregation and thrombus formation, which may justify some of the recently reported thromboembolic and ischemic events. This suggests the adoption of anticoagulation therapies following TAVI, and some caution in the patients' selection. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	3.4
The term spondyloarthritis (SpA) is now increasingly used to classify and diagnose patients who are characterized by inflammation in the axial skeleton and peripheral manifestations (arthritis and enthesitis). The management of SpA should be tailored according to the current manifestations of the disease, the disease activity and functional impairment. The current article focuses on diagnosis and therapy in patients with axial SpA. Diagnostic procedures are discussed in light of diagnostic utility and feasibility in daily routine care. Cornerstones of treatment in patients with axial SpA are a combination of regular exercise and pharmacological treatment options aiming at anti-inflammatory strategies.	5.3
The availability of water through community based water harvesting structure has intensified agriculture and improved livelihood of the surveyed beneficiary households in the Shivalik foothills of India. Before the introduction of Makowal Type Water Harvesting System (before MTWHS), only 83.8% farmers in kharif and 79.7% during rabi season were growing crops but after its introduction (after MTWHS) the corresponding values improved to 100% and 97.3%, respectively, thus increasing cropping intensity from 145% to 189%. Introduction of MTWHS enabled farmers to take paddy and agro-forestry during Kharif, and vegetables and fodder during Rabi season. The increase in cultivated area due to MTWHS was to the tune of 46.1% in Kharif and 36.3% during Rabi, while increase in crop productivity ranged from 55.1% to 111.3% in kharif and 8.6 to 132.0% in Rabi season. Better availability of irrigation changed varietal spectrum in favour of hybrids and high yielding varieties and farmers started adopting improved agronomic practices targeting better input-use efficiency. The MTWHS produced positive impact on the on-farm (crops, dairy and agro-forestry) sources of income and reduced the relative dependence on off-farm activities (labour, community forest area, etc.) for earnings. This system has brought drinking water very close to hutments of rural women thus reducing their drudgery and saving time. In general, rainwater harvesting from forest watersheds has resulted in quantum jumps in crop and milk production and acted as a catalyst to tie up the economic interest of communities, along with forest protection.	4.3
Shade coffee certification programs that aim to conserve the forest and to prevent forest degradation have attracted an increasing amount of attention. However, such programs' impact on forest degradation remains unclear because of the absence of empirical evidence. In addition, there is heated debate about whether certification programs create an incentive for producers to expand their coffee-growing areas, which may accelerate forest degradation in the surrounding natural forest. This study, which was conducted in Ethiopia, aimed to evaluate the impact of a shade coffee certification program on forest degradation. Additionally, to provide empirical evidence for the debate, we examined the spillover effects of certification to surrounding forest areas and used remote sensing data of 2005 and 2010 to classify forest areas based on their density. We applied matching methods, such as the propensity score matching with different algorithms, to compare forest coffee areas with and without the certification. We found that the certified forest coffee areas slightly increased in forest density. By contrast, we observed drastic forest degradation in the forest coffee areas without certification. We checked the sensitivity of our results and found that our results are robust to potential hidden bias. Furthermore, our empirical results revealed that the natural forest areas within a 100-m radius from the forest coffee boundary area exhibited significantly reduced forest degradation compared with forest areas under similar environmental conditions but that such positive and significant impact diminished after 100-m distance. These results indicate that the certification program is effective in alleviating forest degradation in the certified area and in the surrounding natural forest. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Low levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have been identified and proposed as a novel biomarker for the disease. The lack of validation studies of previous results prompted us to replicate this finding in a comprehensive series of patients and controls. We applied droplet digital polymerase chain reaction in CSF specimens from 124 patients representing the AD spectrum and 140 neurologically healthy controls. The following pre-analytical and analytical parameters were evaluated: the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on mtDNA, the linearity of mtDNA load across serial dilutions, and the mtDNA levels in the diagnostic groups. We found a wide range of mtDNA copies, which resulted in a high degree of overlap between groups. Although the AD group presented significantly higher mtDNA counts, the receiver-operating characteristic analysis disclosed an area under the curve of 0.715 to distinguish AD patients from controls. MtDNA was highly stable with low analytical variability. In conclusion, mtDNA levels in CSF show a high interindividual variability, with great overlap within phenotypes and presents low sensitivity for AD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
The development of advanced semiconductor devices relies heavily on technology computer-aided design. Front-end process simulators model the fabrication of devices including different process steps and effects such as ion implantation, dopant and defect diffusion and interaction, epitaxial growth, and stress effects. Continuum process simulators continue to be the main tool; however, kinetic Monte Carlo simulators with and without lattice have become important as well. With the need to explore new materials other than silicon, such as SiGe, germanium, and III-V, more fundamental modeling is required to compensate for missing experimental information. Ab initio methods based on density functional theory and molecular dynamics can help address open questions of material characteristics that cannot be extracted explicitly by experiments. In this paper, we give an overview of a multiscale approach for advanced process modeling and discuss the latest progress.	3.0
A challenge to protein based therapies is the ability to produce biologically active proteins and their ensured delivery. Various approaches have been utilised including fusion of protein transduction domains with a protein or biomolecule of interest. A compounding issue is lack of specificity, efficiency and indeed whether the protein fusions are actually translocated into the cell and not merely an artefact of the fixation process. Here we present a novel platform, allowing the inducible export and uptake of a protein of interest. The system utilises a combination of the Tetracyline repressor system, combined with a fusion protein containing the N-terminal signal peptide from human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit, and a C-terminal poly-arginine domain for efficient uptake by target cells. This novel platform was validated using enhanced green fluorescent protein as the gene of interest. Doxycycline efficiently induced expression of the fusion protein. The human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit facilitated the export of the fusion protein into the cell culture media. Finally, the fusion protein was able to efficiently enter into neighbouring cells (target cells), mediated by the poly-arginine cell penetrating peptide. Importantly we have addressed the issue of whether the observed uptake is an artefact of the fixation process or indeed genuine translocation. In addition this platform provides a number of potential applications in diverse areas such as stem cell biology, immune therapy and cancer targeting therapies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We present the easy-to-use Sequence Search Tool for Antimicrobial Resistance, SSTAR. It combines a locally executed BLASTN search against a customizable database with an intuitive graphical user interface for identifying antimicrobial resistance (AR) genes from genomic data. Although the database is initially populated from a public repository of acquired resistance determinants (i.e., ARG-ANNOT), it can be customized for particular pathogen groups and resistance mechanisms. For instance, outer membrane porin sequences associated with carbapenem resistance phenotypes can be added, and known intrinsic mechanisms can be included. Unique about this tool is the ability to easily detect putative new alleles and truncated versions of existing AR genes. Variants and potential new alleles are brought to the attention of the user for further investigation. For instance, SSTAR is able to identify modified or truncated versions of porins, which may be of great importance in carbapenemase-negative carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. SSTAR is written in Java and is therefore platform independent and compatible with both Windows and Unix operating systems. SSTAR and its manual, which includes a simple installation guide, are freely available from https://github.com/tomdeman-bio/Sequence-Search-Tool-for-Antimicrobial-Resistance-SSTAR-. IMPORTANCE Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is quickly becoming a routine method for identifying genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AR). However, for many microbiologists, the use and analysis of WGS data present a substantial challenge. We developed SSTAR, software with a graphical user interface that enables the identification of known AR genes from WGS and has the unique capacity to easily detect new variants of known AR genes, including truncated protein variants. Current software solutions do not notify the user when genes are truncated and, therefore, likely nonfunctional, which makes phenotype predictions less accurate. SSTAR users can apply any AR database of interest as a reference comparator and can manually add genes that impact resistance, even if such genes are not resistance determinants per se (e.g., porins and efflux pumps).	0.4
Choroideraemia is a rare X-linked chorioretinal disease characterised by progressive degeneration of the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid. 1 The causes of choroideraemia have been reported to be pathogenic variants in the CHM gene, encoding Rab escort protein 1.(2,3) In affected males, although progressive loss of the visual fields is commonly seen, the central vision is usually maintained until middle age. On the other hand, female carriers generally have good visual acuities but frequently show fundus abnormalities. Moreover, a recent study revealed that female carriers had reduced microperimetric sensitivity.(4) Macular hole (MH) formation is a rare complication in inherited chorioretinal diseases and its occurrence in choroideraemia patients has been reported rarely in the literature. This report presents details on a choroideraemic patient with a full-thickness MH that closed without having to undergo vitrectomy surgery.	6.4
A one-dimensional multi-phase flow model for thermomagnetically pumped ferrofluid with heat transfer is proposed. The thermodynamic model is a combination of a simplified particle model and thermodynamic equations of state for the base fluid. The magnetization model is based on statistical mechanics, taking into account non-uniform particle size distributions. An implementation of the proposed model is validated against experiments from the literature, and found to give good predictions for the thermomagnetic pumping performance. However, the results reveal a very large sensitivity to uncertainties in heat transfer coefficient predictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.4
A graphene based ink for printing passive electrical components (conductive traces, resistors, capacitors, inductors) and circuitry on mechanically flexible polymer substrates is described in this paper. The ink is synthesized by using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a hydrophilic cellulose derivative, to suspend the naturally hydrophobic graphene (G) sheets in an aqueous solvent composed of 70% DI water and 30% 2-butoxyethanol. Once deposited on the functionalized substrate the conductivity of the printed electrical components can be optimized by decomposing the cellulose stabilizer using thermal reduction. Several printed passive electrical circuits are fabricated and tested including an interdigitated capacitive chemical sensor and a low-pass electrical filter. The measured characteristics of the printed circuits are compared with theoretical values for performance validation. Mechanical bending tests were also performed to demonstrate that the thermally modified G-CMC films can absorb large levels of strain without fracturing or degrading the electrical properties.	1.2
The deleterious effects of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) on the phase-space and energy spread of high-energy beams in accelerator light sources can significantly constrain the machine design and performance. In this paper, we present a simple method to preserve the beam emittance by means of using magnetized beams that exhibit a large aspect ratio on their transverse dimensions. The concept is based in combining a finite solenoid field where the beam is generated with a special optics adapter. Numerical simulations of this new type of beam source show that the induced phase-space density growth from CSR can be notably suppressed to less than 1% for any bunch charge. This work elucidates the key parameters that are needed for emittance preservation, such as the required field and aspect ratio for a given bunch charge. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both genetic factors and early life adversity play major roles in the etiology of schizophrenia. Our previous studies indicated that social isolation (SI) during early postnatal development leads to several lasting abnormal behavioral and pathophysiological features resembling the core symptoms of some human neuropsychiatric disorders in mice. The glutamate and dopamine hypotheses are tightly linked to the development of schizophrenia. The cross-talk between glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate acid receptors and dopamine receptors is associated with histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (HINT1), which is correlated with diverse psychiatric disorders. We examined the effects of SI on schizophrenia-like behavior and used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to investigate the expression levels of HINT1, the NR1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate acid receptor, and dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) in C57 mice. We found that SI leads to a series of schizophrenia-related deficits, such as social withdrawal, anxiety disorder, cognitive impairments, and sensorimotor gating disturbances. These abnormal phenotypes paralleled changes of HINT1, NR1, and D2R. SI may be considered a robust model of the effects of early life stress on the schizophrenia-related behaviors in mice. Potential interactions among HINT1, NR1, and D2R may underlie the behavioral deficits induced by SI. Copyright (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.	5.4
Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based employment model for people with severe mental illness, but it has not been evaluated for clients enrolled in substance abuse treatment programs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of IPS for people with opioid use disorders enrolled in an opioid treatment program. Within a randomized controlled experiment, 45 patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy were assigned to either IPS or a 6-month waitlist. The waitlist group received IPS after 6 months. The primary outcome assessed over 1 year compared the attainment of a job for the IPS condition to the waitlist comparison group. During the first 6 months after enrollment, 11 (50%) active IPS participants gained competitive employment compared to 1 (5%) waitlist participant (I (2) = 12.0, p < 0.001). Over 12 months of enrollment, 11 (50%) IPS participants gained competitive employment compared to 5 (22%) waitlist participants (I (2) = 3.92, p = 0.07). We conclude that IPS holds promise as an employment intervention for people with opioid use disorders in methadone maintenance treatment, but larger trials with longer follow-up are needed.	5.0
Recently, implicit methods have been employed as a method to understand the underlying attitudes of the participant while also bypassing the social desirability biases that explicit measures are vulnerable to. Unfortunately, the literature has not considered the viewpoints of the individuals who participate in this process and the face validity they ascribe to the test's results. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore how individuals respond to engaging in and receiving the results of an implicit test that addresses a sensitive topic and exploring the subsequent methodological implications. Specifically, we conduct a qualitative exploratory study of individuals' reactions to their scores on the race-based implicit association test (IAT) using publically accessible comments from online message boards. Overall, we discuss four themes: the reporting of results, questioning IAT legitimacy, explicit racism/in-group behavior, and humor. Using a sensemaking theoretical framework, we discuss our findings and make recommendations for the future use of implicit tests.	2.0
Digital computers that automate manufacturing process are an important aspect for any manufacturing engineers in the modern world. Selection of the programming paradigm (PP), as well as the programming language (PL) that supports it, is crucial to ensure the correct ideas are being used to automate the solution of the problem. In current Malaysian Higher institution practices, various PPs and PLs courses are offered to current undergraduate manufacturing majors. An online survey was deployed to experienced manufacturing engineers from various manufacturing specializations in the industry. Graduates from one of Malaysia's public universities, International Islamic University Malaysia (HUM) have been chosen for this particular study. From the survey, it has been found that almost 80% of the participants agreed that PPs are important for manufacturing graduates. It was found out that 90% of the participants were from intermediate (scale of 3) until poor (scale of 1) to express their ability to explain PPs if asked. Only about 10% are able to explain on PPs (scale of 4 and 5). The study concluded that majority of the manufacturing graduates from HUM agreed that PP is an important subject to be taught in university. However, it was found the majority of the manufacturing graduates lack the knowledge and understanding of PPs and general PLs.	3.2
This paper describes a new calibration system developed at INMETRO to guarantee traceability of low-frequency alternating current (ac) voltage calibrations (<1 kHz) to a programmable Josephson ac waveform synthesizer. The automated full-synchronous system allows the synchronization of a commercial calibrator or signal synthesizer with a programmable Josephson voltage synthesizer system to be made by employing digital sampling and signal processing techniques, aided by adaptive digital control. It allows accurate determination of the spectral content of ac signals with minimum human intervention. System operation, measurement techniques, and data analysis are detailed.	1.4
Volcanic ash cloud detection has been a difficult problem in moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral remote sensing application. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are effective feature extraction methods based on second-order and higher order statistical analysis, and the support vector machine (SVM) can realize the nonlinear classification in low-dimensional space. Based on the characteristics of MODIS multispectral remote sensing image, via presenting a new volcanic ash cloud detection method, named combined PCA-ICA-weighted and SVM (CPIWS), the current study tested the real volcanic ash cloud detection cases, i.e., Sangeang Api volcanic ash cloud of 30 May 2014. Our experiments suggest that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed CPIWS method reach 87.20 and 0.7958%, respectively, under certain conditions with the suitable weighted values; this has certain feasibility and practical significance.	4.2
The 2015 release of the precipitation climatology from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) for 1951-2000, based on climatological normals of about 75,100 rain gauges, allows for quantification of mean land surface precipitation as part of the global water cycle. In GPCC's 2011-release, a bulk climatological correction was applied to compensate for gauge undercatch. In this paper we derive an improved correction approach based on the synoptic weather reports for the period 1982-2015. The compared results show that the climatological approach tends to overestimate the correction for Central and Eastern Europe, especially in the northern winter, and in other regions throughout the year. Applying the mean weather-dependent correction to the GPCC's uncorrected precipitation climatology for 1951-2000 gives a value of 854.7 mm of precipitation per year (excluding Antarctica) or 790 mm for the global land surface. The warming of nearly 1 K relative to pre-industrial temperatures is expected to be accompanied by a 2%-3% increase in global (land and ocean) precipitation. However, a comparison of climatology for 30-year reference periods from 1931-1960 up to 1981-2010 reveals no significant trend for land surface precipitation. This may be caused by the large variability of precipitation, the varying data coverage over time and other issues related to the sampling of rain-gauge networks. The GPCC continues to enlarge and further improve the quality of its database, and will generate precipitation analyses with homogeneous data coverage over time. Another way to reduce the sampling issues is the combination of rain gauge-based analyses with remote sensing (i.e., satellite or radar) datasets.	4.2
We present the instrumentation and results of spectroscopic remote sensing of atmospheric NO2 levels based on recording spectra of visible solar radiation scattered from the zenith sky, carried out in the central part of St. Petersburg in 2009-2016. The data obtained qualitatively agree with the results of simultaneous analogous measurements in a suburb of St. Petersburg (Petrodvorets), and also with data from the closest satellite measurements.	4.2
We examined the relationships between Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC), Lewy body disease (LBD), and vascular brain injury (VBI) in 2 large autopsy samples. Because findings may differ between study populations, data came from U. S. Alzheimer's Disease Centers contributing to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (n = 2742) and from the population-based Adult Changes in Thought study (n = 499). Regardless of study population, over 50% of participants with ADNC had cooccurring LBD or VBI; the majority of whom had a clinical AD dementia diagnosis prior to death. Overlap of pathologies was similar between studies, especially after standardizing to the distribution of age and dementia status in the Adult Changes in Thought population. LBD, but not VBI, was positively associated with ADNC in both studies. Interestingly, cortical LBD was more common in those with intermediate ADNC compared to low or high ADNC, especially in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (p < 0.001). High prevalence of co-occurring neuropathologies among older adults with dementia has implications for accurate diagnosis of dementia etiologies and development of disease-modifying strategies.

Previous studies show that close friends improve at lie detection over time. However, is this improvement due to an increase in the ability to decode the feelings of close friends or a change in how close friends communicate their true and deceptive emotions? In a study of 45 pairs of friends, one friend from each pair (the sender) was videotaped showing truthful and faked affect in response to pleasant and unpleasant movie clips. The other friend from each pair (the judge) guessed the true emotions of both the friend and a stranger 1 month and 6 months into the friendship. Judges were better at guessing the true emotions of friends than strangers, and this advantage in judging friends increased among close friends over time. Surprisingly, improvement over time was due mostly to a change in the sender's communication, rather than an increase in judges' ability to decode their friends' feelings.	2.3
The International Working Group (IWG) has classified Alzheimer's disease (AD) as two different types, the typical form and the atypical form, but clinicopathological studies of atypical AD are limited. Because atypical AD cases usually present with early-onset dementia, we investigated 12 patients with early-onset AD, including two patients with typical AD and 10 patients with atypical AD. Of these patients, six had the posterior variant, three had the frontal variant and one had the logopenic variant mixed with semantic dementia. We reported MRI, single-photon emission CT and neuropathological findings in six representative cases. We also described a left temporal variant of AD presenting with transcortical cortical sensory aphasia, which has not been reported previously and is another subtype of the posterior variant of AD. We found a significant correlation between regional cerebral blood flow and counts of NFTs in the cerebral cortices. An atypical presentation with focal neuropsychological symptoms roughly correlated with the density of NFTs in the cerebral cortex and more directly related to spongiform changes in the superficial layers of these areas. In contrast, the distribution of amyloid depositions was diffuse and did not necessarily correlate with focal neuropsychological symptoms. Braak staging or ABC score is not necessarily appropriate to evaluate atypical AD, and instead, spongiform changes in addition to tau pathology in the association cortices better explain the diversity of atypical AD. Interestingly, another patient with a posterior variant of AD had a novel type of atypical plaque, which we referred to as lucent plaque. They were recognizable with HE staining in the circumference and dystrophic neurites were abundant with Gallyas-Braak staining. These plaques demonstrated intense immunoreactivity to both tau AT-8 and amyloid beta (A beta), suggesting a peculiar coexistence pattern of amyloid and tau in these plaques. Clinicopathological studies of atypical AD will provide a new understanding of the pathophysiology of AD.	5.2
In Data Mining, during the preprocessing step, there is a considerable diversity of candidate algorithms to select important features, according to some criteria. This broad availability of algorithms that perform the Feature Selection task gives rise to the difficulty of choosing, a priori, between the algorithms at hand, the most promising one for a particular problem. In this paper, we present the proposal and evaluation of a new architecture for the recommendation of Feature Selection algorithms based on the use of Metalearning. Our framework is very flexible since the user can adapt it to its proper needs. This flexibility is one of the main advantages of our proposal over other approaches in the literature, which involve steps that cannot be adapted to the user's local requirements. Furthermore, it combines several concepts of intelligent systems, including Machine Learning and Data Mining, with topics derived from expert systems, as user and data-driven knowledge, with meta-knowledge. This set of solutions coupled with leading edge technologies allows our architecture to be integrated into any information system, which impact on the automation of services and in reducing human effort during the process. Regarding the Metalearning process, our framework considers several types of properties inherent to the data sets, as well as, Feature Selection algorithms based on many information, distance, dependence and consistency measures. The quality of the methods for Feature Selection was estimated according to a multicriteria performance measure, which guided the ranking process of these algorithms for the construction of data metabases. Proposed by the authors of this work, this multicriteria performance measure combines any three measurements on a single one, creating an interesting and powerful tool to evaluate not only FS algorithms but also to assess any context where it is necessary a combination to maximize a measure or minimize it. The recommendation models, represented by decision trees and induced from the training metabases, allowed us to see in what circumstances a Feature Selection algorithm outperforms the other and what aspects of the data present greater influence in determining the performance of these algorithms. Nevertheless, if the user wishes, any other learning algorithm may be used to induce the recommendation model. This versatility is another strong point of this proposal. Results show that with the characterization of data, through statistical, information and complexity measures, it is possible to reach an accuracy higher than 90%. Besides yielding recommendation models that are interpretable and robust to overfitting, the developed architecture is less computationally expensive than approaches recently proposed in the literature.

Background: Untold numbers of women worldwide are survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) with a substantial number of these experiencing co-occurring mental health and substance use problems. Despite the complex interconnections among these problems, funding mechanisms and organizational structures and mandates have been designed to address just a single, focal problem. One of the challenges for frontline providers is the lack of effective, evidence-informed inter-professional education or training to help them identify and appropriately respond to co-occurring problems. We developed an evidence-informed, competency-based curriculum to address this gap. In this paper we report on its effectiveness in increasing knowledge, changing beliefs and enhancing skills of frontline workers from all three sectors. Methods: The curriculum consists of multiple elements: a text manual; an interactive, online series of modules; and, an in-person workshop. Frontline workers (n = 1111) in the violence against women (VAW) (n = 499), mental health (n = 229), addiction treatment (n = 167), and associated sectors (n = 149) were recruited to attend the workshop and instructed to read the manual or complete the online modules before attending. Some failed to respond (n = 67). Online pre-and post-tests were used to assess changes in knowledge, beliefs and skills; evaluations of the workshop were also collected. Results: Matched pre- and post-tests were available for over half of the participants (n = 624). Results show statistically significant improvements across all six competency domains from pre to post-test (p < 0.0001). Significant changes in participants' knowledge and stigmatizing beliefs were achieved. There was no correlation among differences in sector, age, size of organization, years of experience or prior training. Participant feedback made evident prior misconceptions about women experiencing co-occurring problems, improved understanding about the need to bridge silos, as well as the need for enhanced self-care. Conclusions: An educational intervention designed to sensitize frontline workers to the realities of women's experiences of co-occurring problems, educate about the challenges of accessing help when there are co-occurring problems, and bridge discipline and practice-based silos, can effectively challenge and alter providers' negative attitudes and stigmatizing beliefs.	5.0
The supply of water for rural populations in developing countries continues to present enormous problems, particularly where there is arsenic contamination in the groundwater, as exists over significant parts of Bangladesh. In response, improvements in the sustainability of water supplies are feasible through the use of a combination of water sources wherein rainwater harvesting is employed for a portion of the year. This can potentially reduce the duration of the year during which arsenic-contaminated groundwater is utilized. As demonstrated, a rainwater cistern volume of 0.5 m(3) in the Jessore district area of Bangladesh can provide rainwater for periods averaging 266 days of the year, which allows groundwater at 184 mu g/L arsenic to be used as a water supply for the remainder of the year. This dual supply approach provides the body burden equivalent to the interim drinking water guideline of arsenic concentration of 50 mu g/L for 365 days of the year (assuming the water consumption rate is 4 L/cap/day for a family of five with a rainwater collection area of 15 m(2)). If the water use rate is 20 L/cap/day, the same cistern can provide water for 150 days of the year; however, although this is insufficient to supply water to meet the body burden equivalent guideline of 50 mu g/L. Results are provided also for different rooftop areas, sizes of cisterns and alternative arsenic guidelines [World Health Organization (WHO) and Bangladeshi]. These findings provide useful guidelines on supply options to meet sustainability targets of water supply. However, they also demonstrate that the use of cisterns cannot assist the meeting of the 10 mu g/L WHO target arsenic body burden, if the arsenic contamination in the groundwater is high (e. g., at 100 mu g/L).	4.3
Natural interaction refers to people interacting with technology as they are used to interact with the real world in everyday life, through gestures, expressions, movements, etc., and discovering the world by looking around and manipulating physical objects [16]. In the domain of cultural heritage research has been conducted in a number of directions including (a) Personalised Information in Museums, (b) Interactive Exhibits, (c) Interactive Games Installations in Museums, (d) Museum Mobile Applications, (e) Museums presence on the Web and (f) Museum Social Applications. Most museums target family groups and organize family-oriented events in their programs but how families choose to visit particular museums in response to their leisure needs has rarely been highlighted. This work exploits the possibility of extending the usage of AmI technology, and thus the user experience, within leisure spaces provided by museums such as cafeterias. The Museum Coffee Table is an augmented physical surface where physical objects can be used for accessing information about artists and their creations. At the same entertainment for children is facilitated through the integration of popular games on the surface. As a result, the entire family can seat around the table, drink coffee and complete their visit to the museum acquiring additional knowledge and playing games.	4.0
Today's globalized environment exposes people to culture mixing-mixing of iconic symbols of different cultures in the same space at the same time. Findings on individuals' exposure to culture mixing provide evidence for both exclusionary and inclusionary responses. In this article, we focus on the growing phenomenon of culture mixing of global and local symbols and artifacts. We generate a conceptual model to identify who is likely to respond in what way to the mixed cultural environment and why. To answer these questions, we build on the global acculturation model, which aims to explain individuals' adaptation to the global environment by considering the relative strength of their local and global identities. We extend this model by considering not only the two entities' relative strength but also their balance-the degree of symmetry between the identities' strength. We propose that individuals with dominant (unbalanced) identity types (global or local) will exhibit negative and exclusionary responses to culture mixing, whereas individuals with balanced identity types (glocal or marginal) will exhibit positive and inclusionary responses to culture mixing. We also incorporate the concept of bicultural identity integration (BII) to suggest that individuals with high identification with both cultures (glocals) and with high BII will exhibit more inclusive responses than glocals with low BII. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.	2.0
Computer network is a dynamic entity whose state changes with the introduction of new services, installation of new network operating system, and addition of new hardware components, creation of new user roles and by attacks from various actors instigated by aggressors. Unauthorized intrusion into a computer system or network is one of the most serious threats to computer security. Intrusion detection systems have been developed to provide early warning of an intrusion so that defensive action can be taken to prevent or minimize damage. Intrusion detection involves detecting unusual patterns of activity or patterns of activity that are known to correlate with intrusions. One of the two most publicized threats to security is the intruder (the other is viruses), often referred to as a hacker or cracker. Various security mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete network. In this paper, we have derived more number of probabilities for prediction rules and implemented those probabilities in the simulation model web application to protect the datacenter.	0.2
Security is an important problem in wireless sensor networks. Intrusion detection system is one of the most common methods of network security, for which more and more people have shown solicitude. In this paper, a dynamic random password authentication (DRPA) method is proposed for the identity authentication of communication nodes, which can detect and prevent malicious behavior at each stage of the network operation. This paper introduces the method of automatic generation of random passwords. When a user wants to communicate, the password will be verified to confirm whether it is a normal user or a malicious user. The passwords generation and verification process is very suitable for wireless sensor networks. By using NS2, the simulation experiments are carried out and the results show that this method is superior to the other methods.	0.2
Maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment depends on the ability to metabolize exogenously and endogenously generated toxins, and to repair cellular damage caused by such toxins. Reactive aldehydes have been demonstrated to cause specific genotoxic injury, namely DNA interstrand cross-links. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a member of a 19 isoenzyme ALDH family with different substrate specificities, subcellular localization, and patterns of expression. ALDH2 is localized in mitochondria and is essential for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby placing it directly downstream of ethanol metabolism. Deficiency in ALDH2 expression and function are caused by a single nucleotide substitution and resulting amino acid change, called ALDH2*2. This genetic polymorphism affects 35-45% of East Asians (about-560 million people), and causes the well-known Asian flushing syndrome, which results in disulfiram-like reactions after ethanol consumption. Recently, the ALDH2*2 genotype has been found to be associated with marrow failure, with both an increased risk of sporadic aplastic anemia and more rapid progression of Fanconi anemia This review discusses the unexpected interrelationship between aldehydes, ALDH2 and hematopoietic stem cell biology, and in particular its relationship to Fanconi anemia (C) 2016 The Authors.

The present study examined teachers' domain-specific self-efficacy (TSE) in relation to individual students with a variety of social-emotional behaviors in class. Using a sample of 526 third-to sixth-grade students and 69 teachers, multilevel modeling was conducted to examine students' externalizing, internalizing, and prosocial behaviors as predictors of TSE toward individual students, and the potential moderating roles of teaching experience and teachers' perceived amount of classroom misbehavior. Results showed that most of the variance in TSE occurred within teachers. Students' externalizing behavior was negatively associated with TSE for instructional strategies, behavior management, student engagement, and emotional support. In contrast, teachers reported higher levels of self-efficacy toward students with high levels of prosocial behavior, irrespective of teaching domain. Students' internalizing behavior predicted lower levels of TSE for instructional strategies and emotional support, and higher levels of TSE for behavior management. Last, teachers' perceived levels of classroom misbehavior exacerbated the negative association between externalizing student behavior and TSE for behavior management. These findings illustrate the importance of viewing TSE from a dyadic perspective.	2.4
An exciting paradise of data is emerging into our daily life along with the development of relative perceptive technologies in smart home. How to automatically and actively recognize real-time activities from the big data is one key challenge for the future pervasive computing and ambient intelligence. Solving this problem can greatly enhance the development of relative technologies for eldercare, childcare or healthcare. This paper proposes an event-driven approach, namely activity event model, for real-time activity recognition in smart home (ERAR). The ERAR approach segments data flow based on AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm and recognizes activities based on SVM model. The AES Dynamic Segmentation algorithm uses activity event similarity (AES) to dynamically segment data flow, and can effectively distinguish concurrent activities. Experiments in the context of smart home are presented to show that our ERAR approach performs better than the baseline approaches.	4.0
Point alignment is an important topic in computer vision. In order to implement cross-stitch embroidery in an automatic way, the grid points in a raster like pattern are desired to be recognized at first. In this paper, we design an algorithm to align the grid points in a raster like pattern in case of checkerboard pattern, and the proposed method was used to recognize the weave holes in a cross-stitch pattern. The method implemented in four steps. First, vertices on the boundary were extracted via removing the inner points. Next, the four corner points were detected in the extracted boundary points. Then the left-lower and left-upper points were positioned. Finally, the points alignment was implemented starting at the left-lower point from the bottom to top, left to right. The comparison experiments demonstrated that our method is robust to geometrical distortion and pose change. The method was applied to align the weave holes in a cross-stitch pattern. The results showed that the proposed method addressed its potential application to the machine weave of the cross-stitch. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	0.0
Temporary closures of polluted coastal waters to shellfish harvesting protect human health but also generate broad socioeconomic impacts on rural, fishing-dependent communities. Improved understanding of these impacts could help coastal managers prioritize investments to protect water quality and mitigate the effects of coastal pollution. Using a regression model of monthly landings, we explore the impact of temporary closures on the commercial harvest of soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) in the Machias Bay region of Maine (USA). We find that economic losses are significant and depend heavily on tidal activity, and the size, frequency and timing of closures. Over the nine-year sample period (2001 2009), temporary pollution closures contributed to the loss of 33.6 million in forgone revenue (2014 dollars), approximately 27.4% of total revenue. Closures linked to combined sewer overflows from the Machias wastewater system produce the majority of these losses ($2.0 million) with the largest occurring during the peak clamming season (May August). Our results highlight the variability of the impacts of closures and the information burden for efficient management of shellfish areas and coastal waters. By strategically reducing pollution, managers could limit public health risks, avoid destabilizing harvesting and revenue, and bolster the resilience of fishing communities. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper reviews recent developments in power loss analysis applicable, but not limited to, the thermal design of electrical machines. Accurate and computationally efficient loss prediction is an essential element in thermal analysis of electrical machines, and has become an increasingly important part of the machine design-development process. The continuous drive towards 'more electric' technologies has resulted in a need for a more comprehensive and detailed design approach, where various multi-physics and multi-disciplinary effects are accounted for. This 'design for application' methodology relies strongly on the advancements and evolution of the existing theoretical and experimental design techniques to satisfy the evermore-demanding machine design requirements. The thermal behaviour and efficiency of the power conversion are the machine performance measures, which are the essential elements of the 'design for application' approach. An overview of the challenges and limitations regarding the power loss analysis in the context of thermal design of electrical machines is provided in the paper. All of the major loss components associated with the active parts of the machine assembly are discussed.	3.3
Mammalian evolution has occurred in the presence of mutualistic, commensal, and pathogenic micro-and macro-organisms for millennia. The presence of these organisms during mammalian evolution has allowed for intimate crosstalk between these colonizing species and the host immune system. In this review, we introduce the concept of the 'multibiome' to holistically refer to the biodiverse collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi and multicellular helminthic worms colonizing the mammalian intestine. Furthermore, we discuss new insights into multibiome-host interactions in the context of host-protective immunity and immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we provide reasons to account for the multibiome in experimental design, analysis and in therapeutic applications. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have developed a network robot system framework with the objective of enabling practical deployment of social robots to provide real-world services in everyday social environments. This framework addresses practical issues in social human-robot interaction by integrating ambient intelligence systems, networked data stores, human supervisors, and centralized planning. All of the elements of the system have been developed and tested in public and commercial spaces such as shopping malls, resulting in a flexible robot control architecture based on practical, real-world requirements. We describe several elements of the system and demonstrate examples of its use in five years of real-world field deployments and research. Finally, we present the Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform (UNR-PF), an internationally-standardized high-level architecture for service robots based on our framework.	4.0
Temperature-based death time estimation is based either on simple phenomenological models of corpse cooling or on detailed physical heat transfer models. The latter are much more complex but allow a higher accuracy of death time estimation, as in principle, all relevant cooling mechanisms can be taken into account. Here, a complete workflow for finite element-based cooling simulation is presented. The following steps are demonstrated on a CT phantom: Computer tomography (CT) scan Segmentation of the CT images for thermodynamically relevant features of individual geometries and compilation in a geometric computer-aided design (CAD) model Conversion of the segmentation result into a finite element (FE) simulation model Computation of the model cooling curve (MOD) Calculation of the cooling time (CTE) For the first time in FE-based cooling time estimation, the steps from the CT image over segmentation to FE model generation are performed semi-automatically. The cooling time calculation results are compared to cooling measurements performed on the phantoms under controlled conditions. In this context, the method is validated using a CT phantom. Some of the phantoms' thermodynamic material parameters had to be determined via independent experiments. Moreover, the impact of geometry and material parameter uncertainties on the estimated cooling time is investigated by a sensitivity analysis.	3.0
This study presents a novel approach based on a four-electrode electrochemical biosensor for the detection of tau protein one of the possible markers for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biosensor is based on the formation of stable antibody antigen complexes on gold microband electrodes covered with a layer of a self-assembled monolayer and protein G. Antibodies were immobilized on the gold electrode surface in an optimal orientation by protein G interaction. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used to analyze impedance change, which revealed a linear response with increasing tau concentrations. The assay is fast ( < 1 h for incubation and measurement) and very sensitive. The limit of quantification for the full-length 2N4R tau protein is 0.03 pM, a value unaltered when the assay was processed in bovine serum albumin or human serum. This technology could be adapted for the detection of other biomarkers to provide a multiple assay to identify AD progression in a point of care setting.	5.2
Previous research has suggested an important role for the emotion of hatred in intergroup aggression. Recent theoretical and empirical work has strongly suggested that the combination of anger, contempt, and disgust (ANCODI) comprise the basic elements of hatred, and are the key emotions associated with intergroup aggression. No study, however, has provided evidence that these emotions cause hostile cognitions about specific groups. We report two studies that provide initial evidence. In both, participants were members of ideologically motivated groups and were primed with ANCODI. In Study 1 participants primed with ANCODI produced more aggressive cognitions relative to their opponent outgroup than a neutral outgroup; this effect did not occur for participants primed with fear-sadness. In Study 2 participants primed with ANCODI engaged in more competitive decision making against their opponent outgroups than a neutral outgroup; this effect did not occur for participants primed with disgust only. These findings contribute to the literature on the role of emotion in intergroup aggression and hostility, and provide a more nuanced view of the role of emotions in intergroup relations, possibly identifying the basic emotional elements of hatred.

Study Design: To report a new technique. Objective: To introduce a new method of precise correction controlling for ankylosing spondylitis kyphosis. Summary of Background Data: The exact angle method is excellent for calculating the pedicle subtraction osteotomy angle but is difficult to perform during surgery. In this study, the precise rod bending technique was proposed as a new method for precise correction controlling for ankylosing spondylitis kyphosis through illustrative cases. Methods: A preoperative plan using the exact angle method, with exact osteotomy angle and level determined, was prepared using a whole-spine lateral x-ray film. Then a precise contoured rod imitating the predicted spine correction was obtained using the lateral spine x-ray film that was of the actual size of the trunk. This rod model was disinfected and used for precisely controlling kyphosis correction in ankylosing spondylitis patients with good cervical spine and hip joints. Results: Four ankylosing spondylitis kyphosis patients were successfully corrected using the precise bending rod technique. Their mean age was 31 years, the mean operative time was 247 minutes (160-320 min), the mean volume of bleeding was 1482mL (727-2700 mL), and the average follow-up period was 13.8 months (9-17 mo). All patients regained their sagittal balance (all C7-SSVL <= 2 cm). The predicted ostetomy degree was accurate to within 2 degrees compared with the achieved degree at the osteotomy site. No complications occurred during or after surgery. Conclusions: The precise rod bending technique is a simple, effective method for precise correction of kyphosis caused by ankylosing spondylitis. The surgical result corresponded to the preoperative planning.	5.3
The aim of the article is to describe the nonverbal communication patterns that passengers of the Delhi Metro use to manage density-induced territorial intrusions, and to identify some of the contextual variables that affect their deployment. After introducing the notion of interrogative look and the dataset, the following section depicts the techniques that passengers were observed to employ in order to solve the problem of territorial intrusion without breaking anonymity. The bulk of the analysis deals with the structure and function of interrogative looks, an objectively defined pattern of nonverbal behavior that the touched uses to signal her discontent to the toucher. The rest of the section describes a less frequent pattern whereby passengers contagiously signal the playful character of their mischiefs. Next is examined if and how density, i. e. the number of individuals per surface unit, influences as a contextual variable the occurrence of interrogative looks. The closing discussion considers the main findings from the standpoint of their local specificity.	2.3
This study examined the impact of a selective anxiety prevention program for offspring of clinically anxious parents on three domains of child functioning: (1) social, (2) familial, and (3) emotional/behavioral. Dyads were randomized into either the Coping and Promoting Strength program (CAPS; n = 70) or Information Monitoring (IM; n = 66) comparison group. Multi-informant assessments were conducted at baseline, post intervention, and 6 and 12 months follow-ups. Random effects mixed models under the linear growth modeling (LGM) framework was used to assess the impact of CAPS on growth trajectories. Over time, children in the CAPS group had significantly lower anxiety, anxious/depressed symptoms, and lower total behavior problems (parent report), compared to children in IM group. The intervention did not impact other domains assessed (e.g., social functioning), which may be due to floor effects on these measures. Longitudinal follow-up data is needed to provide valuable information about this high risk population.	5.4
Buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist and kappa antagonist which is used for the treatment of pain and opioid addiction. A mixture of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride has been approved for the treatment of opioid dependence. In this study a third order derivative spectrophotometric method based on zero-crossing technique has been used for the simultaneous determination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride in tablets. The measurements were carried out at wavelengths of 257.8 (zero-crossing point of naloxone hydrochloride) and 252.2 nm (zero-crossing point of buprenorphice hydrochloride) for buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride, respectively in the third order derivative spectra obtained in methanol and 0.1 M NaOH (50: 50) as solvent. The method was found to be linear in the range of 20-80 mu g/mL for buprenorphine hydrochloride and 5-20 mu g/mL for naloxone hydrochloride. The within-day and between-day coefficient of variation and error values were less than 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. The proposed method was successfully used for simultaneous determination of these drugs in pharmaceutical dosage form without any interference from excipients or need to prior separation before analysis.	5.0
We present a scalable computing framework for the solution stochastic multiobjective optimization problems. The proposed framework uses a nested conditional value-at-risk (hCVaR) metric to find compromise solutions among conflicting random objectives. We prove that the associated nCVaR minimization problem can be cast as a standard stochastic programming problem with expected value (linking) constraints. We also show that these problems can be implemented in a modular and compact manner using PLASM (a Julia-based structured modeling framework) and can be solved efficiently using PIPS-NLP (a parallel nonlinear solver). We apply the framework to a CHP design study in which we seek to find compromise solutions that trade-off cost, water, and emissions in the face of uncertainty in electricity and water demands.

Research on pain judgement has shown that several features of a target influence empathy for others' pain. Considering the pivotal role of morality in social judgement, we investigated whether judgements of others' social and physical suffering vary as a function of the target's moral status. Study 1 manipulated the moral characteristics of an unknown other and found that participants ascribed less social (but not physical) suffering to a target depicted as lacking moral status rather than to a target high in morality. Study 2 added a control condition in which no information about the target's moral qualities was provided, and showed that the effect of morality on social pain judgements was driven by the depiction of the target as lacking moral traits. Study 3 revealed the specific role of morality, as information on another evaluative dimension (i.e., competence) had no effects on pain judgements. Study 4 showed that social targets perceived as lacking moral qualities are thought to experience less social pain than highly moral targets because of their perceived lower level of humanity. Overall, our findings suggest that social (but not physical) pain might represent a capacity that is denied to social targets that are perceived low in morality.	2.2
The New Zealand Earth System Model (NZESM) is currently under development to help inform scientists, policy makers, climate-sensitive sectors of the economy, and the general public in New Zealand about climate change. The term `climate model' is generally used to describe a computer model that incorporates physical aspects of the climate system such as atmospheric and oceanic fluid mechanics and thermodynam- ics. In addition, Earth System Models represent aspects of biology and chemistry such as marine biogeochemistry and atmospheric ozone chemistry. The development of the NZESM represents a step-change in model complexity for New Zealand science, and a major motivation for its development is to reduce Southern Hemisphere specific mod- elling problems such as the formation of Southern Ocean sea ice and Antarctic Bottom Water. The atmosphere, land surface, ocean and sea ice components of the model are already available in New Zealand. In the future, additional models representing (for ex-ample) ocean biogeochemistry and marine ice-sheets will also be added to the NZESM framework. Over the next 5 years, the NZESM will be run to produce hindcasts for the past 150 years and projections for up to 200 years into the future. Such experiments will ... enable New Zealanders to adapt, manage risk, and thrive in a changing climate, which is the mission statement of the Deep South National Science Challenge. Over the next decade, the NZESM will be used in Earth System science research throughout New Zealand, both in terms of pure science and via communication of its results to New Zealanders.	3.4
Background: sIgE and sIgG4 detection is necessary for more accurate and effective type I hypersensitivity diagnostics and the estimation of disease development. Typically, the analyses of these antibodies are performed separately with the help of various specialized systems. The aim of this study was to develop a microarray-based method for the simultaneous quantitative detection of sIgE and sIgG4 to the most common allergens in a single sample. Methods: A quantitative method for the simultaneous detection of sIgE and sIgG4 was developed based on the technology of hydrogel microchips previously designed at Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences (EIMB RAS). The microarray contained gel pads with immobilized allergens and gel pads that allow for the obtaining of sIgE and sIgG4 internal calibration curves for each allergen during the assay. The possibility of the simultaneous detection of sIgE and sIgG4 was developed using the corresponding Cy5 and Cy3 fluorescent dyes. Results: The multiplex immunoassay method using hydrogel microarrays developed in this study allowed the quantitative detection of sIgE and sIgG4 to 31 allergens from different groups in a single assay. A comparison of the microarray with the existing plate-based analogues (i.e., ALLERG-O-LIQ and sIgG4 ELISA) was performed by analysing 152 blood serum samples and by evaluating Pearson correlation coefficients, ROC analysis, and Passing-Bablok linear regression results. Conclusion: The implementation of this method in allergy diagnostics will provide the possibility of simultaneously performing primary patient screening and obtaining additional information concerning the severity of the allergies and the choice of an appropriate therapy.	5.1
The basic idea of nanofluid was to enhance the thermal conductivity of base fluid. However, the classical nanofluid models have some drastic limitations, i.e. they cannot describe a class of fluids that have certain microscopic characters arising from the microrotation and local structure of the fluid elements. Therefore, the present work is one of the infrequent contributions that describes the microrotation and microinertia characteristics of nanofluids. More exactly, in this work, the unsteady free convection flow of micropolar nanofluids is investigated over a vertical plate. Five types of oxide nanoparticles namely copper oxide, titanium oxide, alumina oxide, iron oxide and graphene oxide are suspended in three different types of fluids such as water, kerosene and engine oil. Exact solutions of the governing problem are obtained by the Laplace transform method. Solutions for conventional or regular nanofluid is also recovered as a special case. Temperature of graphene oxide suspended micropolar nanofluid is higher than other oxide nanoparticles based nanofluids. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.	3.4
Secure data aggregation (SDA) schemes are widely used in distributed applications, such as mobile sensor networks, to reduce communication cost, prolong the network life cycle and provide security. However, most SDA are only suited for a single type of statistics (i.e., summation-based or comparison-based statistics) and are not applicable to obtaining multiple statistic results. Most SDA are also inefficient for dynamic networks. This paper presents multi-functional secure data aggregation (MFSDA), in which the mapping step and coding step are introduced to provide value-preserving and order-preserving and, later, to enable arbitrary statistics support in the same query. MFSDA is suited for dynamic networks because these active nodes can be counted directly from aggregation data. The proposed scheme is tolerant to many types of attacks. The network load of the proposed scheme is balanced, and no significant bottleneck exists. The MFSDA includes two versions: MFSDA-I and MFSDA-II. The first one can obtain accurate results, while the second one is a more generalized version that can significantly reduce network traffic at the expense of less accuracy loss.	0.2
A combined theoretical and experimental investigation was carried out with the objective of evaluating theoretical predictions relating to a two-dimensional airfoil subjected to high amplitude harmonic oscillation of the free stream at constant angle of attack. Current theoretical approaches were reviewed and extended for the purposes of quantifying the hound, unsteady vortex sheet strength along the airfoil chord. This resulted in a closed form solution that is valid for arbitrary reduced frequencies and amplitudes. In the experiments, the bound, unsteady vortex strength of a symmetric 18% thick airfoil at low angles of attack was measured in a dedicated unsteady wind tunnel at maximum reduced frequencies of 0.1 and at velocity oscillations less than or equal to 50%. With the boundary layer tripped near the leading edge and mid-chord, the phase and amplitude variations of the lift coefficient corresponded reasonably well with the theory. Near the maximum lift coefficient overshoot, the data exhibited an additional high-frequency oscillation. Comparisons of the measured and predicted vortex sheet indicated the existence of a recirculation bubble upstream of the trailing edge which sheds into the wake and modifies the Kutta condition. Without boundary layer tripping, a mid-chord bubble is present that strengthens during flow deceleration and its shedding produces a dramatically different effect. Instead of a lift coefficient overshoot, as per the theory, the data exhibit a significant undershoot. This undershoot is also accompanied by high-frequency oscillations that are characterized by the bubble shedding. In summary, the location of bubble and its subsequent shedding play decisive roles in the resulting temporal aerodynamic loads.	3.4
Ketamine is used clinically as a racemic mixture of optical isomers that differ in their analgesic properties and psychomimetic effects. Administered individually, or together as the racemate, ketamine enantiomers differ in their hepatic clearance and duration of anesthetic effect. S(+) ketamine exhibits a greater clearance and faster anesthetic recovery compared to the racemate and a greater clearance compared to R(-) ketamine. Ketamine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily via N-demethylation to norketamine, yet little is known about the human metabolism of ketamine enantiomers. The purpose of this investigation therefore was to characterize ketamine racemate and enantiomer metabolism by human liver and to test the hypothesis that differences in hepatic ketamine enantiomer metabolism can account for observed differences in ketamine enantiomer pharmacokinetics. Ketamine N-demethylation by microsomes from three human livers was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At ketamine concentrations typically achieved during anesthesia (5 muM), the rate of S(+) ketamine demethylation was 20% greater than that of R(-) ketamine and 10% greater than that of the racemate (P <.05). At all ketamine concentrations, the rate of racemate demethylation was less than the sum of the rates for the individual enantiomers, reflecting a metabolic enantiomeric interaction whereby one ketamine enantiomer inhibits the metabolism of the other enantiomer. N-demethylation of racemic ketamine and each enantiomer was catalyzed by two apparent enzymes, a high affinity-low capacity enzyme (K(m1) 30-50 muM, V(max1) 2-6 nmoles.min-1.nmole-1) and a low affinity-high capacity enzyme (K(m2) 600-800 muM, V(max2) 9-15 nmoles.min-1.nmole-1). At therapeutic concentrations, ketamine metabolism is catalyzed predominantly by one enzyme (the low K(m) enzyme), permitting calculation of the in vitro clearance parameter V(max1)/K(m1). In vitro clearances of ketamine enantiomers and the racemate were excellent predictors of the relative in vivo clearances. These results demonstrate relative enantiomeric selectivity in human liver ketamine metabolism, which accounts for observed differences in the clinical pharmacokinetics of racemic ketamine and ketamine enantiomers.	6.2
The overarching objective of this article is to describe the Swedish public's knowledge about HIV and attitudes toward people living with HIV during the period 1987-2011. Within the framework of this objective, the article also directs a special focus at the association between knowledge about HIV transmission and attitudes toward people who are HIV positive. The study is based on the results of a questionnaire sent to a stratified random sample on eight occasions between 1987 and 2011. The study population comprises the Swedish general public aged 16-44 and is stratified on the basis of the respondents' age, with each of five age groups (16-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-34, and 35-44) comprising 20% of the study respondents. A total of 21,027 individuals have completed the questionnaire in the eight surveys. The survey instrument is relatively short and comprises 27 questions on knowledge, attitudes and sexual behaviour relating to HIV. The eight surveys show that the public's knowledge about HIV and its different transmission routes is high and has increased over time. Above all there has been an increase in the level of knowledge about how HIV is not transmitted between people. However, the public's knowledge about the infectiousness of individuals receiving treatment for HIV infection is low. Public attitudes toward people with HIV have also undergone a clear shift over time, toward increased tolerance and a decline in the level of fear, especially in social situations. Despite this, a residual suspicion and stigmatisation can be seen in the public's attitudes to people who are HIV positive. This is most obvious from the questions that link HIV to sexuality and here the changes are very modest over time. Public knowledge about HIV and its transmission routes has increased between 1987 and 2011. Attitudes toward people who are HIV positive have generally become more tolerant and positive, not least in relation to different social situations. The fear of becoming infected has declined. At the same time there remains a stigma, which continues to direct suspicion at people who are living with HIV and to ascribe them negative characteristics and behaviors that are based on prejudice. The results show, however, that the public's attitudes toward same-sex relationships are clearly more accepting today than they were previously, and that the symbolic association between HIV and this group is tending to become weaker.	2.0
IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein, which is aberrantly expressed in several tumor types and is closely associated with the development, metastasis and prognosis of cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that IQGAP1 has broad prospects in the basic and clinical research of tumors. The present study aimed to explore the effects of IQGAP1-small interfering (si) NA on the proliferation and metastasis of U251 and U373 glioma cell lines, which markedly expressed IQGAP1. The human glioma cell lines (U251 and U373) were transfected with siRNA and transfection efficacy was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting kit-8, and cell metastasis capabilities were detected using cell adhesion, migration and invasion assays. In addition, the expression levels of several tumor-associated genes were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results indicated that IQGAP1 was expressed at higher levels in glioma tissues compared with in normal brain tissues. IQGAP1-siRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, and cell adhesion, migration and invasion. Furthermore, the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, Snail, MMP9, fibronectin 1 and Twist were suppressed, and E-cadherin was upregulated in response to siRNA-IQGAP1. The present study identified the function of IQGAP1 in glioma cell biology, and indicated that it may be considered a novel target for glioma treatment.	6.1
Human tauopathies such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Pick's disease etc., are a group of neurodegenerative diseases which are characterized by abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau that leads to formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Recapitulating several features of human neurodegenerative disorders, the Drosophila tauopathy model displays compromised lifespan, locomotor function impairment, and brain vacuolization in adult brain which is progressive and age dependent. Here, we demonstrate that tissue-specific downregulation of the Drosophila homolog of human c-myc proto-oncogene (dMyc) suppresses tau-mediated morphological and functional deficits by reducing abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and restoring the heterochromatin loss. Our studies show for the first time that the inherent chromatin remodeling ability of myc proto-oncogenes could be exploited to limit the pathogenesis of human neuronal tauopathies in the Drosophila disease model. Interestingly, recent reports on successful uses of some anti-cancer drugs against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in clinical trials and animal models strongly support our findings and proposed possibility.	5.2
In the context of cell biology, the term mesoscale describes length scales ranging from that of an individual cell, down to the size of the molecular machines. In this spatial regime, small building blocks self-organise to form large, functional structures. A comprehensive set of rules governing mesoscale self-organisation has not been established, making the prediction of many cell behaviours difficult, if not impossible. Our knowledge of mesoscale biology comes from experimental data, in particular, imaging. Here, we explore the application of soft X-ray tomography (SXT) to imaging the mesoscale, and describe the structural insights this technology can generate. We also discuss how SXT imaging is complemented by the addition of correlative fluorescence data measured from the same cell. This combination of two discrete imaging modalities produces a 3D view of the cell that blends high-resolution structural information with precise molecular localisation data.	6.1
Computer-aided process planning is an important component for linking design and manufacturing in computer-aided design/computer-aided process planning/computer-aided manufacturing integrated manufacturing systems. Operation sequencing in computer-aided process planning is one of the most essential tasks. To solve the problem and acquire optimal process plans, operation sequencing is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with various constraints, and a novel modified ant colony optimization algorithm is developed to solve it. To ensure the feasibility of process plans, constrained relationships considered among operations are classified into two categories called precedence constraint relationships and clustering constraint relationships. Operation precedence graph based on constrained relationships is formed to get visual representation. To ensure good manufacturing economy, in the mathematical model for optimization, total weighted production cost or weighted resource transformation time related to machine changes, setup changes, tool changes, machines and tools is utilized as the evaluation criterion. To avoid local optimum and enhance global search ability, adaptive updating method and local search mechanism are embedded into the optimization algorithm. Case studies of three parts are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the modified ant colony optimization algorithm, and some comparisons between the modified ant colony optimization algorithm and previous genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, tabu search and particle swarm optimization algorithm are discussed. The results show that the modified ant colony optimization algorithm performs well in the operation sequencing problem.	3.0
Excessive sedimentation derived from anthropogenic activities is a main factor in habitat and biodiversity loss in freshwater ecosystems. To prevent offsite movement of soil particles, many environmental regulatory agencies mandate the use of perimeter silt fences. However, research regarding the efficiency of these devices in applied settings is lacking, and fences are often ineffective due to poor installation and maintenance. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of research regarding silt fences, address the current culture surrounding silt fence installation and maintenance, and provide several recommendations for improving the knowledge base related to silt fence effectiveness. It is clear that there is a need for integrated long-term (i.e., extending from prior to fence installation to well after fence removal) multi-disciplinary research with appropriate controls that evaluates the effectiveness of silt control fences. Through laboratory experiments, in silica modelling and field studies there are many factors that can be experimentally manipulated such as soil types (and sediment feed rate), precipitation regimes (and flow rate), season, slope, level of site disturbance, fence installation method, type of fence material, depth of toe, type and spacing of support structures, time since installation, level of inspection and maintenance, among others, that all require systematic evaluation. Doing so will inform the practice, as well as identify specific technical research needs, related to silt fence design and use. Moreover, what constitutes proper installation and maintenance is unclear, especially given regional- and site-level Variation in precipitation, slope, and soil characteristics. Educating and empowering construction crews to be proactive in maintenance of silt fencing is needed given an apparent lack of compliance monitoring by regulatory agencies and the realities that the damage is almost instantaneous when silt fences fail. Our goal is not to dismiss silt fences as a potentially useful tool. Instead, we question the way they are currently being used and call for better science to determine what factors (in terms of fence design, installation and site-characteristics) influence effectiveness as well as better training for those that install, maintain and inspect such devices. We also encourage efforts to look beyond the fence to consider how silt fences can be combined with other sediment control strategies as part of an integrated sediment control program.

Objective. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has been extensively implicated in the regulation of body weight, food intake, and energy. expenditure. The role of PTP1B appears to be cell and brain region dependent. Results. Herein, we demonstrated that chronic high-fat feeding enhanced PTP1B expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) of rats compared to rats on chow: Knocking down PTP1B with oligonucleotide antisense (ASO) decreased its expression and was sufficient to improve the anorexigenic effect of insulin through IR/Akt signaling in the CeA. ASO treatment reduces body weight, fat mass, serum leptin levels, and food intake and also increases energy expenditure, without altering ambulatory activity. These changes were explained, at least in part, by the improvement of insulin sensitivity in the CeA, decreasing NPY and enhancing oxytocin expression. There was a slight decline in fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels possibly due to leanness in rats treated with ASO. Surprisingly, the elevated plus maze test revealed an anxiolytic behavior after reduction of PTP1B in the CeA. Conclusions. Thus, the present study highlights the deleterious role that the amygdalar PTP1B has on energy homeostasis in obesity states. The reduction of PTP1B in the CeA may be a strategy for the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance and anxiety disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.4
Objectives: This study focuses on facilitation of clients' psychosocial communication during prenatal counseling for fetal anomaly screening. We assessed how psychosocial communication by clients is related to midwives' psychosocial and affective communication, client-directed gaze and counseling duration. Methods: During 184 videotaped prenatal counseling consultations with 20 Dutch midwives, verbal psychosocial and affective behavior was measured by the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). We rated the duration of client-directed gaze. We performed multilevel analyses to assess the relation between clients' psychosocial communication and midwives' psychosocial and affective communication, client-directed gaze and counseling duration. Results: Clients' psychosocial communication was higher if midwives' asked more psychosocial questions and showed more affective behavior (beta = 0.90; Cl: 0.45-1.35; p < 0.00 and beta = 132; CI: 0.18-2.47; p = 0.025, respectively). Clients psychosocial communication was not related to midwives client-directed gaze. Additionally, psychosocial communication by clients was directly, positively related to the counseling duration (beta = 0.59; CI: 0.20-099; p= 0.004). Conclusions: In contrast with our expectations, midwives' client-directed gaze was not related with psychosocial communication of clients. Practice implications: In addition to asking psychosocial questions, our study shows that midwives' affective behavior and counseling duration is likely to encourage client's psychosocial communication, known to be especially important for facilitating decision-making.

Brucella species are facultative intracellular pathogens that infect animals as their natural hosts. Transmission to humans is most commonly caused by direct contact with infected animals or by ingestion of contaminated food and can lead to severe chronic infections. Brucella can invade professional and non-professional phagocytic cells and replicates within endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. The host factors required for Brucella entry into host cells, avoidance of lysosomal degradation, and replication in the ER-like compartment remain largely unknown. Here we describe two assays to identify host factors involved in Brucella entry and replication in HeLa cells. The protocols describe the use of RNA interference, while alternative screening methods could be applied. The assays are based on the detection of fluorescently labeled bacteria in fluorescently labeled host cells using automated wide-field microscopy. The fluorescent images are analyzed using a standardized image analysis pipeline in CellProfiler which allows single cell-based infection scoring. In the endpoint assay, intracellular replication is measured two days after infection. This allows bacteria to traffic to their replicative niche where proliferation is initiated around 12 hr after bacterial entry. Brucella which have successfully established an intracellular niche will thus have strongly proliferated inside host cells. Since intracellular bacteria will greatly outnumber individual extracellular or intracellular non-replicative bacteria, a strain constitutively expressing GFP can be used. The strong GFP signal is then used to identify infected cells. In contrast, for the entry assay it is essential to differentiate between intracellular and extracellular bacteria. Here, a strain encoding for a tetracycline-inducible GFP is used. Induction of GFP with simultaneous inactivation of extracellular bacteria by gentamicin enables the differentiation between intracellular and extracellular bacteria based on the GFP signal, with only intracellular bacteria being able to express GFP. This allows the robust detection of single intracellular bacteria before intracellular proliferation is initiated.	6.1
Stormwater runoff poses serious environmental problems and public health issues in Rwanda, a tropical country that is increasingly suffering from severe floods, landslides, soil erosion and water pollution. Using the WetSpa Extension model, this study assessed the changes in rainfall runoff depth in Rwanda from 1990 to 2016 in response to precipitation and land use changes. Our results show that Rwanda has experienced a significant conversion of natural forest and grassland to cropland and built-up areas. During the period 1990-2016, 7090.02 km(2) (64.5%) and 1715.26 km(2) (32.1%) of forest and grassland covers were lost, respectively, while the cropland and built-up areas increased by 135.3% (8503.75 km(2)) and 304.3% (355.02 km(2)), respectively. According to our estimates, the land use change effect resulted in a national mean runoff depth increase of 2.33 mm/year (0.38%). Although precipitation change affected the inter-annual fluctuation of runoff, the long-term trend of runoff was dominated by land use change. The top five districts that experienced the annual runoff depth increase (all >3.8 mm/year) are Rubavu, Nyabihu, Ngororero, Gakenke, and Musanze. Their annual runoff depths increased at a rate of >3.8 mm/year during the past 27 years, due to severe deforestation (ranging from 62% to 85%) and cropland expansion (ranging from 123% to 293%). These areas require high priority in runoff control using terracing in croplands and rainwater harvesting systems such as dam/reservoirs, percolation tanks, storage tanks, etc. The wet season runoff was three times higher than the dry season runoff in Rwanda; appropriate rainwater management and reservation could provide valuable irrigation water for the dry season or drought years (late rainfall onsets or early rainfall cessations). It was estimated that a reservation of 30.5% (3.99 km(3)) of the runoff in the wet season could meet the cropland irrigation water gap during the dry season in 2016.	4.3
Digital technology has been widely used in the field of implant dentistry. From a surgical standpoint, computer-guided surgery can be utilized to enhance primary implant stability and to improve the precision of implant placement. From a prosthetic standpoint, computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) technology has brought about various restorative options, including the fabrication of customized abutments through a virtual design based on computer-guided surgical planning. This case report describes a novel technique combining the use of a three-dimensional (3D) printed surgical template for the immediate placement of an implant, with CAD/CAM technology to optimize hard and soft tissue healing after bone grafting with the use of a socket sealing abutment.	3.0
Aggressive behaviors in schools have the potential to cause serious harm to students' emotional and social well-being and to limit their ability to achieve their full academic potential. Prevention programs developed to reduce children's aggressive behaviors in school settings can provide interventions at a universal or targeted level. The main aim of our randomized control study was to examine the efficacy of Coping Power, adapted as a universal prevention program, in reducing children's behavioral problems and improving school grades. Nine classes participated (184 students, mean age 91 months) from two elementary state schools in Tuscany, Italy. Study findings showed a significant reduction in behavioral problems and an improvement in school grades for the intervention classes relative to the control classes. This study suggests the Coping Power program can be delivered in school settings at both universal and targeted prevention levels, and that in this multi-tiered prevention model, teachers, educators and school psychologists can learn a set of intervention skills which can be delivered with flexibility, thus reducing some of the complexity and costs of schools using multiple interventions.	2.4
The decreasing cost and size of video sensors has led to camera networks becoming pervasive in our lives. However, the ability to analyze these images effectively is very much a function of the quality of the acquired images. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically controlling the fields of view of individual pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras in a camera network leading to improved situation awareness (e. g., where and what are the critical targets and events) in a region of interest. The network of cameras attempts to observe the entire region of interest at some minimum resolution while opportunistically acquiring high resolution images of critical events in real time. Since many activities involve groups of people interacting, an important decision that the network needs to make is whether to focus on individuals or groups of them. This is achieved by understanding the performance of video analysis tasks and designing camera control strategies to improve a metric that quantifies the quality of the source imagery. Optimization strategies, along with a distributed implementation, are proposed, and their theoretical properties analyzed. The proposed methods bring together computer vision and network control ideas. The performance of the proposed methodologies discussed herein has been evaluated on a real-life wireless network of PTZ capable cameras.	0.0
Introduction. - Modern techniques of computer-aided design and tridimensional prototyping for manufacturing silicone elastomer custom implants are growing. They have widely modified the surgical indications in our unit. Materials and methods. - By presenting their experience of 611 cases managed between 1993 and 2016, the authors describe the method of conception from CT-scans, the virtual image of the body and the manufacture of the custom-made implant perfectly adapted to the anatomy of each one. The operative techniques are described for the three main indications: the funnel chest or pectus excavatum (474 cases) according to a modified CHIN classification is corrected simply and very satisfactorily. This approach may render thoracic surgery techniques obsolete. Indeed, these operations remain risky and of doubtful functional utility; Poland syndrome (116 cases), where the use of a custom-made implant for compensation of muscle volume is frequently used, but can be improved by a transfer of adipose tissue or a classic breast implant; the leg atrophies (21 cases) receive custom elastomer implants introduced in a sub-fascial plane. Results. - The results are excellent for pectus excavatum but more difficult to optimize for the other two indications, requiring sometimes complementary techniques. Complications are rare and often benign, implants endure for life. Quality of life, psychological comfort and self-esteem have been improved with low morbidity and without having undergone a painful surgical experience. Conclusion. - Reconstructive procedures of congenital malformations by custom-made silicone implants open a new field of activity for our surgical specialty with vast opportunities.

Remote sensing applications in water resources management are becoming an essential asset in all different levels of integrated water rational use. Due to remote sensing data availability and different acquisition sensors of satellite images, a wide variability of benchmarks could be conducted under the same theme. Rainwater harvesting is the branch of science where the rainwater is the main target to improve groundwater recharge, stratocumulus clouds are the main source of rain in arid regions. Cloud detection using remote sensing techniques proved to be efficient recently but the general uses of different cloud detection techniques are to precisely omit clouds from satellite images. The use of cloud detection scheme described herein is designed for the MERIS Level1B data; therefore, total set of 60 MERIS images was collected on monthly basis for 5 years started from January 2008. The use of the cloud detection algorithm is to find proper land cover suitable for rainwater harvesting mostly covered with cloud all over the year. Evaluation of land use for rainwater harvesting in terms of groundwater recharge is considered, several factors were taken into consideration and NDWI is one of the most important factors involved. Results pointed out that some regions in southern Saudi Arabia are qualified enough to be considered as potential sites for better rainwater harvesting.	4.3
For multi-output Boolean functions (also called S-boxes), various measures of nonlinearity have been widely discussed in the literature but many problems are left open in this topic. The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach to estimating the nonlinearity of S-boxes. A more fine-grained view on the notion of nonlinearity of S-boxes is presented and new connections to some linear codes are established. More precisely, we mainly study the nonlinearity indicator (denoted by N-v) for S-boxes from a coding theory point of view. Such a cryptographic parameter N-v is more related to best affine approximation attacks on stream ciphers. We establish a direct link between Nv and the minimum distance of the corresponding linear code. We exploit that connection to derive the first general lower bounds on N-v of non-affine functions from F(2)n to F(2)m for m dividing n. Furthermore, we show that N-v can be determined directly by the weight distribution of the corresponding linear code.	0.3
Research supervision services like providing study materials can be enhanced through mobile information retrieval algorithms. An example is semantic searching algorithms, which require the user to input one or two real world concepts. Systems that implement mobile learning approaches like ambient learning can use semantic searching algorithms to support research supervision services through mobile phones. However, there is low adoption of such approaches in some of the African universities. This has been attributed to limited technical limitations of mobile devices that include mobile phones. For instance, complex interfaces, restricted input and small screens on mobile phones make it difficult to enter search keywords when the user is in a hurry. As an attempt to address these limitations, this paper describes dynamic heuristics - greedy search algorithm that automatically generate search keywords. The algorithm can be used to allow flexible mobile information retrieval on a typical ambient learning system.	4.0
Intersections are known for their integral and complex nature due to a variety of the participants' behaviors and interactions. This paper presents a review of recent studies on the behavior at intersections and the safety analysis for three types of participants at intersections: vehicles, drivers, and pedestrians. This paper emphasizes on techniques which are strong candidates for automation with visual sensing technology. A new behavior and safety classification is presented based on key features used for intersection design, planning, and safety. In addition, performance metrics are introduced to evaluate different studies, and insights are provided regarding the state of the art, inputs, algorithms, challenges, and shortcomings.	0.0
This review begins with a comprehensive history of opioid dependence and treatment in the United States. The focus is an evidence-based treatment model for opioid/opiate dependent individuals. The role of reward genetic polymorphisms and the epigenetic modifications that lead to vulnerability to use and misuse of opiates/opioid to treat pain are reviewed. The neurochemical mechanisms of acute opiate withdrawal and opiate/opioid reward mechanisms are explored with a goal of identifying specific treatment targets. Alterations in functional brain connectivity based on neurobiological mechanisms in heroin dependence and abstinence are also reviewed. A new clinical model an alternative to merely blocking acute withdrawal symptoms as identified in the DSM-5 is proposed. Genetic diagnosis at the onset of detoxification, to determine risk stratification, and identify polymorphic gene targets for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical interventions, followed by the simultaneous initiation of Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT), to enable psychological extinction, and steady pro-dopaminergic therapy with the goal of developing dopamine homeostasis is recommended. The objective of these interventions is to prevent future relapse by treating all Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) behaviors and eventually make an addiction-free life possible.	5.0
The detection and correction of document skew is one of the most important document image analysis steps. The ICDAR2013 Document Image Skew Estimation Contest (DISEC' 13) is the first contest which is dedicated to record recent advances in the field of skew estimation using well established evaluation performance measures on a variety of printed document images. The benchmarking dataset that is used contains 1550 images that were obtained from various sources such as newspapers, scientific books and dictionaries. The document images contain figures, tables, diagrams, architectural plans, electrical circuits and they are written in various languages such as English, Chinese and Greek. This paper describes the details of the contest including the evaluation measures used as well as the performance of the twelve methods submitted by ten different groups along with a short description of each method.	1.2
Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody, is a part of the treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. The most common side effect of cetuximab is skin rash, which has a similar distribution to acne vulgaris and some overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. The aim of the current study was to determine whether acne vulgaris in adolescence (AinA) is predictive of a cetuximab-related rash to better understand the pathogenesis of this side effect and explore potential preventive actions. From July 2013 to June 2015, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer planned for treatment with cetuximab were enrolled in the study. Before initiating treatment, patients completed a questionnaire evaluating endocrine disorders, other chronic diseases, smoking, chronic medications, allergies, and dermatologic history of AinA and its severity. Patients were followed for 6 months. Data were collected from 32 participants (16 women, 16 men). Twenty-three (69%) patients experienced a cetuximab-associated skin reaction. Nine (28%) patients had a history of AinA. Of these, seven developed a cetuximab-associated skin reaction. Three of the five (60%) patients who used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) developed severe (grades 3-4) skin toxicity versus 4/27 (15%) patients who were not on PPIs (P=0.057). The degree of skin toxicity correlated to the median time-to-tumor-progression: 2 months for patients with grades 0-1 compared with 5.5 months for grades 2-4 skin toxicity (P=0.047, 95% confidence interval 1.06-4.95). No significant correlation was found between AinA and cetuximab-associated skin reactions. The correlation between PPI treatment and severe skin toxicity related to cetuximab should be examined further.	5.1
Altered social-emotional functioning is considered to play an important role in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa (AN). Recently, there has been increasing interest in investigating the role of intranasal oxytocin in social-emotional processing. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of intranasal oxytocin on the interpretation and expression of emotions among people with AN. Thirty women with AN and 29 age-matched healthy women took part in the present study, which used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. The participants received a single dose of 40 IU of intranasal oxytocin in one session and a placebo spray in the other. Fifteen minutes after administration, the participants completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test to assess the interpretation of complex emotions and mental states followed by a video task, which assessed expressions of facial affect when they were viewing humorous and sad film clips. The intranasal oxytocin did not significantly influence the expression or interpretation of emotions in the AN or healthy comparison groups. The AN group expressed significantly less positive emotion, spent more time looking away and reported experiencing a significantly more negative affect in response to the film clips. The finding that intranasal oxytocin had little to no effect on the interpretation or expression of emotions in either group supports the notion that the effects of oxytocin on social-emotional processing are not straightforward and may depend on individual and environmental differences, as well as the emotion being processed. Replication of these findings is necessary to explore the effect of timing on the effects of oxytocin before firm conclusions can be drawn. Nonetheless, these findings add to the steady accumulation of evidence that people with AN have reduced emotional expression and avoidance of emotionally provoking stimuli.	2.1
The mechanical energy loss and the wall resistance are very important in practical engineering. These problems are investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation in this paper. The results are as follows. (1) A new mechanical energy equation for the total flow is obtained, and a general formula for the calculation of the mechanical energy loss is proposed. (2) The general relationship between the wall resistance and the mechanical energy loss for the steady channel flow is obtained, the simplified form of which for the steady uniform channel flow is in consistent with the formula used in Hydraulics deduced by pi theorem and dimensional analysis. (3) The steady channel flow over a backward facing step with a small expansion ratio is numerically simulated, and the mechanical energy loss, the wall resistance as well as the relationship between the wall resistance and the mechanical energy loss are calculated and analyzed.	3.1
Evaluate the effect of continuing care interventions for cocaine use with HIV risk-reduction components on HIV sex-risk. Explore whether cocaine use at treatment initiation interacts with the type of continuing care intervention to affect HIV sex-risk. Cocaine dependent participants (N = 321) were randomized to: (1) Treatment as usual (TAU): intensive outpatient treatment, (2) TAU and telephone monitoring and counseling (TMC), and (3) TAU and TMC plus incentives for participation in telephone contacts (TMC+). Participants in TMC and TMC+ received a brief HIV intervention, with booster sessions as needed. Generalized estimating equations analysis compared TAU, TMC and TMC+ at 6, 12, 18, 24 months post-baseline on the following outcomes: overall HIV sex-risk, number of sexual partners, condom usage, exchange of drugs for sex, exchange of sex for drugs, exchange of money for sex, exchange of sex for money, and crack house visits. Overall sex-risk decreased for all treatment conditions at follow-up, with no treatment main effects. For people with no cocaine use at baseline, TAU experienced greater sex-risk reductions than TMC (p < .01) and TMC+ (p < .001). The three treatment conditions are effective in reducing HIV sex-risk. TMC with HIV risk-reduction components is unnecessary for cocaine-dependent clients who stop using cocaine early in treatment.	5.0
Background: Anti-TNF agents have revolutionised rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment; however, a third of patients fail to achieve therapeutic responses. Unexpectedly, studies in murine and human arthritis have indicated that anti-TNF treatment can increase circulating T helper 17 (Th17) cells, but the relationship to treatment response is unclear. To identify immune correlates of anti-TNF treatment response, we conducted a longitudinal study using clinical, ultrasound and T cell assessments. Methods: Patients with RA (n = 25) were studied at protocol visits during the initial 12 weeks of anti-TNF treatment. Improvement in the disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28) >1.2 defined treatment responders (n = 16) and non-responders (n = 9). Changes in synovial thickening and vascularity of 10 metacarpophalangeal joints were quantitatively assessed by grey scale and power Doppler ultrasound. The frequency of circulating Th17 cells was determined by IL17 enzyme-linked immunospot assay (Elispot) and flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)). Results: The frequency of circulating IL17-producing cells increased significantly 12 weeks after anti-TNF initiation (Elispot median (range) specific spot forming cells (spSFC)/10(6) 360 (280-645) vs 632 (367 -1167), p = 0.003). The increase in CD4 + IL17+ cells at 12 weeks was confirmed by FACS (median (range) %, 0.7 (0.5-0.9) vs 1.05 (0.6-1.3); p = 0.01). The increase in circulating Th17 cells inversely correlated with reduction in synovial vascularity (r = -0.68, p = 0.007) and thickening (r = -0.39; p = 0.04). Higher frequencies of circulating Th17 cells at baseline were associated with poorer anti-TNF treatment response defined by ultrasonographic measures. Conclusions: These results demonstrate a link between changes in circulating Th17 cells with resolution of ultrasonographic features of synovial inflammation and vascularity during anti-TNF treatment. The findings may reflect redistribution of Th17 cells from inflamed joints or TNF-driven regulation of Th17 cell production.	5.3
1. Vulnerability segmentation hypothesis proposes that plant branches are more resistant to cavitation than their terminal leaves, namely, the difference in vulnerability to cavitation between branches and their terminal leaves is positive (P50leaf-branch>0). This allows leaves to act as safety valves to protect hydraulic pathway from dysfunction. 2. Recent studies showed that several species from humid regions have negative values of P50leaf-branch, indicating a lack of vulnerability segmentation in these species (LVS species). 3. We hypothesize that compared with species from humid regions, vulnerability segmentation is critical and necessary for arid species to survive droughts, but LVS species may take compensatory hydraulic strategies to maintain safety margins during drought periods. 4. We compile branch and leaf hydraulic trait data of 69 broadleaved woody species belonging to different biomes with contrasting climatic conditions as indicated by variable aridity index (AI), and we find that P50leaf-branch becomes small and even negative with the increase of AI. Although leaves of LVS species may lose their function as safety valves, their deep rooting, great hydraulic conductivity, and/or high stem capacitance features are critical for them to maintain hydraulic safety. 5. The results indicate that vulnerability segmentation is evidently common for species from arid regions, but not necessarily the case for some species from humid regions. With robust cavitation-resistant leaves and effective hydraulic compensatory strategies, LVS species can maintain water supply and the functionality of leaves, thus giving them a hydraulic advantage over counterparts in the face of potential drought stress. A is available for this article.	3.1
This paper presents a simple approach for load flow analysis of a radial distribution network with embedded generation. The proposed approach utilizes forward and backward sweep algorithm based on Kirchoff's current law (KCL) and Kirchoff's voltage law (KVL) for evaluating the node voltages iteratively. In this approach, computation of branch current depends only on the current injected at the neighbouring node and the current in the adjacent branch. This approach starts from the end nodes of sub lateral line, lateral line and main line and moves towards the root node during branch current computation. The node voltage evaluation begins fro in the root node and moves towards the nodes located at the far end of the main, lateral and sub lateral lines. The proposed approach has been tested using three radial distribution systems of different size and configuration and is found to be computationally efficient. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is further demonstrated by integrating the embedded generation into the load flow analysis of the radial distribution network.	1.3
Sex parties are environments where men who have sex with men (MSM) have the opportunity to have sex with multiple partners over a brief period of time. Dim lighting and nonverbal communication are the characteristics of sex parties that make sexual communication more challenging. We report on qualitative data from 47 MSM who attended sex parties in New York City. Participants responded to distinct hypothetical scenarios involving the use of color-coded wristbands to communicate (1) condom use preferences, (2) sexual position (e.g., top, bottom), and (3) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status at sex parties. The majority had positive-to-neutral attitudes toward color-coded wristbands to indicate (1) condom use preference and (2) sexual position (70.8, 75.0 % HIV positive; 63.6, 81.8 %, HIV negative, respectively). These men cited that wristbands would facilitate the process of pursuing partners with similar interests while also avoiding the discomforts of verbal communication. In contrast, 41.7 % of HIV-positive and 50.0 % of HIV-negative men expressed unfavorable attitudes to using wristbands to communicate HIV status. These men cited the potential for HIV-status discrimination as well as suspicions around dishonest disclosure. Although participants were receptive to utilizing color-coded wristbands at sex parties to convey certain information, it may be unfeasible to use wristbands to communicate HIV status.	2.3
Objective: A clinician's ability to infer patients' thoughts and feelings is a critical component of high quality care. The goal of this article is to present a new test to measure this ability in clinicians, called the Test of Accurate Perception of Patients' Affect (TAPPA). Methods: Audiovisual clips were taken from patients' actual medical visits. The patients reviewed the videotape after the visit to identify their thoughts and feelings during the visit. This information was used to extract short audiovisual clips for which the correct answer was the patient's report of the thought or feeling associated with that clip. The TAPPA contains 48 audiovisual clips, each responded to in a multiple choice format. Results: The TAPPA showed good psychometric properties (optimal mean and good variance, adequate internal consistency, and strong re-test reliability) and convergent validity with other tests of emotion recognition. In addition, the test showed predicted better performance by female than male participants. Conclusion: The TAPPA promises to be a valuable tool for research and education on provider-patient relationships and quality of care. Practice implications: A tool for testing clinicians' understanding of patients' thoughts and feelings may contribute to better quality of care and to improved selection and training.

In addition to buffering plants from water stress during severe droughts, plant water storage (PWS) alters many features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil-plant system. How PWS impacts water dynamics and drought resilience is explored using a multi-layer porous media model. The model numerically resolves soil-plant hydrodynamics by coupling them to leaf-level gas exchange and soil-root interfacial layers. Novel features of the model are the considerations of a coordinated relationship between stomatal aperture variation and whole-system hydraulics and of the effects of PWS and nocturnal transpiration (Fe,night) on hydraulic redistribution (HR) in the soil. The model results suggest that daytime PWS usage and Fe,night generate a residual water potential gradient (p,night) along the plant vascular system overnight. This p,night represents a non-negligible competing sink strength that diminishes the significance of HR. Considering the co-occurrence of PWS usage and HR during a single extended dry-down, a wide range of plant attributes and environmental/soil conditions selected to enhance or suppress plant drought resilience is discussed. When compared with HR, model calculations suggest that increased root water influx into plant conducting-tissues overnight maintains a more favorable water status at the leaf, thereby delaying the onset of drought stress.	3.1
The physicochemical properties of anode material are important for the electron transfer of anode bacteria and electricity generation of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In this work, carbon cloth anode was pretreated with isopropanol, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in order to reduce the anode functional groups. The influence of functional groups on the electrochemical properties of carbon cloth anode and power generation of MFCs was investigated. The anode pretreatments removed the surface sizing layer of carbon cloth and substantially reduced the contents of C-O and pyridinic/pyrrolic N groups on the anode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry analyses of the biofilm-matured anodes revealed an enhanced electrochemical electron transfer property because of the anode pretreatments. As compared with the untreated control (612 +/- 6mWm(-2)), the maximum power density of an acetate-fed single-chamber MFC was increased by 26% (773 +/- 5mWm(-2)) with the isopropanol treated anode. Additional treatment with H2O2 and NaOCl further increased the maximum power output to 844 +/- 5mWm(-2) and 831 +/- 4 mWm(-2). A nearly inverse liner relationship was observed between the contents of C-O and pyridinic/pyrrolic N groups on anodes and the anodic exchange current density and the power output of MFCs, indicating an adverse effect of these functional groups on the electricity production of anodes. Results from this study will further our understanding on the microbial interaction with carbon-based electrodes and provide an important guidance for the modification of anode materials for MFCs in future studies.

A variety of compartment models are used for the quantitative analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data. Traditionally, these models use an iterative fitting (IF) method to find the least squares between the measured and calculated values over time, which may encounter some problems such as the overfitting of model parameters and a lack of reproducibility, especially when handling noisy data or error data. In this paper, a machine learning (ML) based kinetic modeling method is introduced, which can fully utilize a historical reference database to build a moderate kinetic model directly dealing with noisy data but not trying to smooth the noise in the image. Also, due to the database, the presented method is capable of automatically adjusting the models using a multi-thread grid parameter searching technique. Furthermore, a candidate competition concept is proposed to combine the advantages of the ML and IF modeling methods, which could find a balance between fitting to historical data and to the unseen target curve. The machine learning based method provides a robust and reproducible solution that is user-independent for VOI-based and pixel-wise quantitative analysis of dynamic PET data.	0.1
Based on the orthogonal superposition theorem of three alternating magnetic components, a universal uniform magnetic spin vector is superimposed using tri-axial Helmholtz coils, achieving successive digital control of the orientation, the rotational speed, and the magnetic flux density of the universal magnetic spin vector. For increasing the magnitude and orientation accuracy of the magnetic spin vector, this paper presents a mathematical model associated with the magnitude error and orientation error of the universal magnetic spin vector, along with a double error compensation method for the magnitude and orientation of the universal magnetic spin vector superimposed by three alternating magnetic components. The double error compensation method includes the current magnitude compensation by three different structural coefficients of tri-axial Helmholtz coils and the current phase compensation by two relative phase differences under linear polarization. The results have shown that the double compensation method can increase the magnitude and orientation accuracy of the rotating magnetic vector effectively, which would achieve an accurate posture adjustment and steering control on the capsule robots in curving environment.	1.4
Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their functional brain networks are presumably already altered. To test this hypothesis, we compared magnetoencephalography (MEG) eyes-closed resting-state recordings from 29 MCI subjects and 29 healthy elderly subjects in the present exploratory study. Functional connectivity in different frequency bands was assessed with the phase lag index (PLI) in source space. Normalized weighted clustering coefficient (normalized Cw) and path length (normalized Lw), as well as network measures derived from the minimum spanning tree [MST; i.e., betweenness centrality (BC) and node degree], were calculated. First, we found altered PLI values in the lower and upper alpha bands in MCI patients compared to controls. Thereafter, we explored network differences in these frequency bands. Normalized Cw and Lw did not differ between the groups, whereas BC and node degree of the MST differed, although these differences did not survive correction for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR). As an exploratory study, we may conclude that: (1) the increases and decreases observed in PLI values in lower and upper alpha bands in MCI patients may be interpreted as a dual pattern of disconnection and aberrant functioning; (2) network measures are in line with connectivity findings, indicating a lower efficiency of the brain networks in MCI patients; (3) the MST centrality measures are more sensitive to detect subtle differences in the functional brain networks in MCI than traditional graph theoretical metrics.	5.2
In this paper, thermal modeling and analysis of a 10kWdouble-stator switched reluctance machine (DSSRM) is presented. Thermal management is an essential step of the machine design, since overheatedwindings and coresmight destroy the insulation and lead to failure of themachine. A three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element method (FEM) has been used to numerically calculate the temperature distribution in different parts of the machine. Furthermore, to include the use of water as coolant, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been utilized. Thermal performance of the prototype is then analyzed at various load conditions. A 10 kW prototype of the DSSRM has been built and the results have been experimentally verified.	3.3
Saliency modeling has played an important part in computer vision studies over the past 30 years. Many state-of-the-art models adopted complex mathematical and machine learning theories. In this paper, a simple and effective visual attention model is proposed. We find that a single fixed template is enough for saliency map generation; this idea is inspired by the receptive field of the human visual system. All that is needed is to convolve the input image with this template with additional post-processing. Experiments show that our model is extremely fast and performs better than state-of-the-art models in human eye fixation prediction.	0.0
Background: China's rapid urbanization over the past decades has exacerbated the problems of environmental degradation and health disparities. However, few studies have analysed the differences between urban and rural residents in relation to how environmental quality impacts health outcomes. This study examines the associations between Chinese people's perceptions of environmental quality and their self-rated health, particularly focusing on differences between rural and urban residents in environment-health relationships. Methods: Using a logistic regression model and data from the 2013 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), a representative sample of data for 3,402 urban residents (46 +/- 16 years) and 2,439 rural residents (48 +/- 15 years) was analysed. The dependent variable used for the logistic regressions was whether or not respondents reported being healthy. Independent variables included respondents' evaluations of the living environment, and how frequently they participated in physical activities. Interaction terms were employed to measure the moderating effects of physical exercise on the relationship between perceived environmental quality and health. Results: The percentage of healthy urban residents was significantly larger than that of healthy rural respondents (70.87% versus 62.87%). Urban respondents living in areas with sufficient green space were more likely to report good health (OR = 0.749, CI = [0.628, 0.895]), while rural respondents without reliable access to fresh water were more likely to report poor health (OR = 0.762, CI = [0.612, 0.949]). Urban respondents who were exposed to green spaces and exercised frequently were 21.6 per cent more likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 1.216, CI = [1.047, 1.413]). Those who lived in areas with insufficient green space and exercised frequently were 19.1 per cent less likely to report good health than those who exercised infrequently (OR = 0.805, CI = [0.469, 1.381]). No evidence suggested that physical exercise exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between exposure to air pollution and health. Conclusions: On average, urban residents have better health than rural residents. Among four indicators for low environmental quality (air pollution, lack of green spaces, water pollution, uncertain access to freshwater resources), green space was an important determinant of urban residents' health status, while unreliable access to fresh water harmed rural residents' health. Physical exercise moderated the effects of exposure to green spaces on urban residents' health.	4.4
Uncertainty must be taken into account in all aspects of ambient intelligence and human decisions and activities. We investigate how to utilize both probabilistic and possibilistic sources of information for use in humanized decision-making. In particular we examine aspects of the possibilistic conditioning of probability developed by Yager. To provide bounding of the resulting probability analysis of the cases of completely certain and uncertain probability and possibility distribution are carried out. Additionally the cases of intermediate uncertainty and a general case of possibilities are analyzed. The Zadeh consistency measure is also used to assess these cases. To consider whether the conditioned probability is more informative for decision-making, three measures, Shannon entropy, Gini index and Renyi entropy are used to compare the original probability distributions and the conditioned distribution for the cases described.	4.0
In order to investigate the rounding process of high precision centerless grinding in time domain reliably and predictably, a virtual machine design approach is essential particularly towards 0.1-0.3 mu m roundness precision. The virtual machine system presented in this paper is developed through high-level integration of the machine characteristics, workpiece rounding mechanism and their intrinsic correlation. In this system, the primary elements affecting the workpiece roundness regeneration, including kinematics, dynamics and control of the machine, grinding dynamics and machining conditions, are integrated into the high precision virtual centerless grinding to render the rounding process, evaluate the machine performance and optimize grinding strategies accordingly. An application case study on virtual machining of the targeted workpiece roundness 0.1 mu m is provided to present the implementation perspectives of the virtual machine system for high precision centerless grinding.	3.3
Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) is normally cleaved by alpha-secretase, but can also be cleaved by ?-secretase (BACE1) to produce C99 fragments in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. C99 is subsequently cleaved to amyloid beta (A beta), the aggregation of which is known to cause Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, C99 removing is for preventing the disease. Selenoprotein S (SelS) is an ER membrane protein participating in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), one of the stages in resolving ER stress of misfolded proteins accumulated in the ER. ERAD has been postulated as one of the processes to degrade C99; however, it remains unclear if the degradation depends on SelS. In this study, we investigated the effect of SelS on C99 degradation. We observed that both SelS and C99 were colocalized in the membrane fraction of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells. While the level of SelS was increased by ER stress, the level of C99 was decreased. However, despite the induction of ER stress, there was no change in the amount of C99 in SelS knock-down cells. The interaction of C99 with p97(VCP), an essential component of the ERAD complex, did not occur in SelS knock-down cells. The ubiquitination of C99 was decreased in SelS knock-down cells. We also found that the extracellular amount of A beta(1-42) was relatively higher in SelS knock-down cells than in control cells. These results suggest that SelS is required for C99 degradation through ERAD, resulting in inhibition of A beta production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.2
Effective HIV prevention requires knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the social networks across which infections are transmitted. These networks most commonly comprise chains of sexual relationships, but in some populations, sharing of contaminated needles is also an important, or even the main mechanism that connects people in the network. Whereas network data have long been collected during survey interviews, new data sources have become increasingly common in recent years, because of advances in molecular biology and the use of partner notification services in HIV prevention and treatment programmes. We review current and emerging methods for collecting HIV-related network data, as well as modelling frameworks commonly used to infer network parameters and map potential HIV transmission pathways within the network. We discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of existing methods and models, and we propose a research agenda for advancing network analysis in HIV epidemiology. We make the case for a combination approach that integrates multiple data sources into a coherent statistical framework. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.	6.0
Switched power electronic converters involve different control actions for different system events. A local control strategy may be developed which reacts only to some local information available to each component without any communication between the different system components located far away in real time. The purpose of this paper is to present a low cost memory based control strategy in a dc-dc boost converter. The control employed in this work is based on a sliding-mode hysteretic control strategy where the sliding manifold is derived a priori and stored as a look-up table in digital memory hardware. The proposed control implementation strategy is low cost and offers a robust dynamic response that is used to mitigate many disturbances in the system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	1.4
Background: Early diagnosis of food allergies (FA) is important for a favorable prognosis. This study aimed to determine the level of awareness of FA among pediatricians in Kuwait. Method: A 43-item self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed to pediatricians working at 4 government hospitals in Kuwait. Results: A total of 140 pediatricians completed the questionnaire, with a participation rate of 51.1% (81 males and 59 females). The mean age of participants was 40.81 years, and the mean number of years working in pediatrics was 13.94 years. The mean overall knowledge score was 22.2. The pediatricians' overall knowledge scores were found to be significantly associated with their age (older pediatricians had higher overall scores) and years of experience as a pediatrician but were independent from hospital site, gender, or rank. A multiple linear regression revealed pediatrician age and gender were the only variables that were significantly associated with the overall knowledge score. Only 16.4% of the participants answered at least 2/ 3 of the survey questions correctly. The questions that were correctly answered by <= 2/3 of the participants constituted 80% of clinical presentation questions, 66.6% of diagnostics questions, 77.7% of treatment questions, and 42.8% of prevention questions. Interestingly, among 68 pediatricians (48.5%) who determined that they felt comfortable evaluating and treating patients with FA, only 12 (17.6%) passed the questionnaire. Conclusions: This survey demonstrates that there is a noteworthy deficiency of pediatricians' awareness about FA. The implementation of strategies to improve pediatricians' awareness is critical to diagnose food allergy patients early and improve their health and outcomes.	5.1
As a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase, demalonylase, and desuccinylase, sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) in host cells has been reportedly observed in the mitochondria, in the cytosol/cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Various functional roles of SIRT5 have also been described in cellular metabolism, energy production, detoxification, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, but some of the reported results are seemingly inconsistent or even contradictory to one another. Using immunocytochemistry, molecular biology, gene transfection, and flow cytometry, we investigated the expression, subcellular distribution, and possible functional roles of SIRT5 in regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress of cultured SH-EP neuroblastoma cells. Both endogenous and transfected exogenous SIRT5 were observed in mitochondria of host SH-EP cells. Overexpression of SIRT5 markedly protected SH-EP cells from apoptosis induced by staurosporine or by incubation in Hank's balanced salt solution. SIRT5 also lowered the level of oxidative stress and countered the toxicity of hydrogen peroxide to SH-EP cells. It was suggested that the anti-apoptotic role of SIRT5 was mediated, at least in part, by its anti-oxidative effect in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells although the involved molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated in details.	6.0
The effects of five towns on river water pollution were examined along the Lyna River (southern watershed of the Baltic Sea, northern Poland). The relationships among the spatially derived indicators of urbanization, environmental variables, and physicochemical and microbiological data (heterotrophic plate count at 22 and 37 degrees C, and fecal coli) obtained from longitudinal river profiling have been examined with the use of multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis with factor analysis (PCA/FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). We recognized the river channel as an environmental path that links serial urban areas into an urban river continuum. An overall increasing trend in nutrients and indicator bacteria from suburban headwaters to urbanized sections of the river was detected despite a significant decrease in those between the towns. We concluded that the role of a multicity is equally as important as a single urban area in predicting the impacts of man-made pollutants on river water quality.	4.4
Objective: Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a type of behavioral addiction characterized by abnormal executive control, leading to loss of control over excessive gaming. Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common comorbid disorders in IGD, involving delayed development of the executive control system, which could predispose individuals to gaming addiction. We investigated the influence of childhood ADHD on neural network features of IGD. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis was performed on 44 young, male IGD subjects with and without childhood ADHD and 19 age-matched, healthy male controls. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)-seeded connectivity was evaluated to assess abnormalities in default mode network (DMN) connectivity, which is associated with deficits in executive control. Results: IGD subjects without childhood ADHD showed expanded functional connectivity (FC) between DMN-related regions (PCC, Medial prefrontal cortex, thalamus) compared with controls. These subjects also exhibited expanded FC between the PCC and brain regions implicated in salience processing (anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex) compared with IGD subjects with childhood ADHD. IGD subjects with childhood ADHD showed expanded FC between the PCC and cerebellum (crus II), a region involved in executive control. The strength of connectivity between the PCC and cerebellum (crus II) was positively correlated with self-reporting scales reflecting impulsiveness. Conclusion: Individuals with IGD showed altered PCC-based FC, the characteristics of which might be dependent upon history of childhood ADHD. Our findings suggest that altered neural networks for executive control in ADHD would be a predisposition for developing IGD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	5.0
Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) catalyzes the eighth step of glycolysis and is often found upregulated in cancer cells. To test the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 26 residue of PGAM1 greatly enhances its activity, we performed both conventional and steered molecular dynamics simulations on the binding and unbinding of PGAM1 to its substrates, with tyrosine 26 either phosphorylated or not. We analyzed the simulated data in terms of structural stability, hydrogen bond formation, binding free energy, etc. We found that tyrosine 26 phosphorylation enhances the binding of PGAM1 to its substrates through generating electrostatic environment and structural features that are advantageous to the binding. Our results may provide valuable insights into computer-aided design of drugs that specifically target cancer cells with PGAM1 tyrosine 26 phosphorylated.	3.0
Alcohol dependence causes physical, social, and moral harms and currently represents an important public health concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), alcoholism is the third leading cause of death worldwide, after tobacco consumption and hypertension. Recent epidemiologic studies have shown a growing trend in alcohol abuse among adolescents, characterized by the consumption of large doses of alcohol over a short time period. Since brain development is an ongoing process during adolescence, short-and long-term brain damage associated with drinking behavior could lead to serious consequences for health and wellbeing. Accumulating evidence indicates that alcohol impairs the function of different components of the melanocortin system, a major player involved in the consolidation of addictive behaviors during adolescence and adulthood. Here, we hypothesize the possible implications of melanocortins and glial cells in the onset and progression of alcohol addiction. In particular, we propose that alcohol-induced decrease in alpha-MSH levels may trigger a cascade of glial inflammatory pathways that culminate in altered gliotransmission in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens (NAc). The latter might potentiate dopaminergic drive in the NAc, contributing to increase the vulnerability to alcohol dependence and addiction in the adolescence and adulthood.	5.0
Multi-label learning draws great interests in many real world applications. It is a highly costly task to assign many labels by the oracle for one instance. Meanwhile, it is also hard to build a good model without diagnosing discriminative labels. Can we reduce the label costs and improve the ability to train a good model for multi-label learning simultaneously? Active learning addresses the less training samples problem by querying the most valuable samples to achieve a better performance with little costs. In multi-label active learning, some researches have been done for querying the relevant labels with less training samples or querying all labels without diagnosing the discriminative information. They all cannot effectively handle the outlier labels for the measurement of uncertainty. Since maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) provides a robust analysis for outliers in many machine learning and data mining algorithms, in this paper, we derive a robust multi-label active learning algorithm based on an MCC by merging uncertainty and representativeness, and propose an efficient alternating optimization method to solve it. With MCC, our method can eliminate the influence of outlier labels that are not discriminative to measure the uncertainty. To make further improvement on the ability of information measurement, we merge uncertainty and representativeness with the prediction labels of unknown data. It cannot only enhance the uncertainty but also improve the similarity measurement of multi-label data with labels information. Experiments on benchmark multi-label data sets have shown a superior performance than the state-of-the- art methods.	0.1
With the rapid developments of computer technology and information technology, human-machine interfaces of aircrafts, ships, nuclear power plants, battlefield command system, and other complex information systems have evolved from the traditional control mode to digital control mode with visual information interface. This paper studies error factors of information interface in human-computer interaction based on visual cognition theory. A feasible error-cognition model is established to solve some design problems which result in serious failures in information recognition and analysis, and even in operation and execution processes. Based on Rasmussen, Norman, Reason and other error types as well as the HERA and CREAM failure identification models, we performed classification and cognitive characterization for error factors according to information search, information recognition, information identification, information selection and judgment as well as the decision-making process and obtained the comprehensive error-cognition model for complex information interface.	1.4
Aiming the problem of parking information release is large flow, and release information is not timely and not accurately, the internet of vehicle (IOV) of the urban traffic parking system is proposed based on the parking lot sensor network and sensor combination and its electrical control circuits. This system will be use the core technology of internet of things (IOT) and combinate the timer and elastic pressure switch with a pressure sensor and its electrical circuits to realize the parking information acquisition, release, query, reservation and parking navigation with reliable and accurately. Experimental results shows the electrical control circuits will be better management the parking information with accurately and the car user uses the vehicle terminal to search the target parking lot and to receive the parking information. This system will be to alleviate the urban traffic and improve the utilization efficiency of urban parking lot, for the future of the city and social development to provide better technical support and basis.	1.2
Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic conditions not only fundamentally affect patients' quality of life and physiological needs but are also negatively associated with work ability. The costs of poor work ability, which, in sum, are more than treatment costs, pose an economic burden to society and patients. Work ability in RA appears to be multifactorial; symptoms such as pain, swelling, and stiffness play a major role, as these directly affect functional disability. Also, RA patients typically suffer from reduced muscle strength. Lower extremity function and grip strengths especially impair their quality of life. However, the role of muscle strength and disease activity as determinants of work ability have not yet been studied. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare work ability in working-age participants with seropositive RA and with high and low disease activity; the secondary objective is to evaluate the association of muscle strength, functional ability, and frailty with work ability. Methods: This monocentric cross-sectional study will be conducted at a rheumatologic outpatient clinic and day hospital with approximately 100 seropositive RA patients aged <65 years. A clinical disease activity index as a measure for rheumatoid disease activity will be assessed during the patients' routine visits at the clinic. Work ability, frailty, and functional disability will be evaluated with (self-reported) questionnaires as well as with physical tests (Work Ability Index/Score; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index; Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument; Short Physical Performance Battery). Muscle strength will be determined with dynamometer measurements of isometric hand grip strength and quadriceps femoris muscle contraction strength. Sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale) and sexual functioning as physiological needs will additionally be determined with self-reported questionnaires. Results: For this study funding has already been awarded and enrollment has been completed. Data are currently being evaluated. Conclusions: This study will evaluate the association of work ability with modifiable parameters such as muscle strength and functional ability. It will provide further insights into work ability in RA and its associated risk factors. Any evidence of association will motivate further research, and the findings might encourage interventions focused specifically on improving muscle strength and lower extremity function to positively affect work ability.	5.3
The traditional prehospital management of trauma victims with potential spinal injury has become increasingly questioned as authors and clinicians have raised concerns about over-triage and harm. In order to address these concerns, the Norwegian National Competence Service for Traumatology commissioned a faculty to provide a national guideline for pre-hospital spinal stabilisation. This work is based on a systematic review of available literature and a standardised consensus process. The faculty recommends a selective approach to spinal stabilisation as well as the implementation of triaging tools based on clinical findings. A strategy of minimal handling should be observed.	5.3
The reductionist approach of dissecting biological systems into their constituents has been successful in the first stage of the molecular biology to elucidate the chemical basis of several biological processes. This knowledge helped biologists to understand the complexity of the biological systems evidencing that most biological functions do not arise from individual molecules; thus, realizing that the emergent properties of the biological systems cannot be explained or be predicted by investigating individual molecules without taking into consideration their relations. Thanks to the improvement of the current -omics technologies and the increasing understanding of the molecular relationships, even more studies are evaluating the biological systems through approaches based on graph theory. Genomic and proteomic data are often combined with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks whose structure is routinely analyzed by algorithms and tools to characterize hubs/bottlenecks and topological, functional, and disease modules. On the other hand, co-expression networks represent a complementary procedure that give the opportunity to evaluate at system level including organisms that lack information on PPIs. Based on these premises, we introduce the reader to the PPI and to the co-expression networks, including aspects of reconstruction and analysis. In particular, the new idea to evaluate large-scale proteomic data by means of co-expression networks will be discussed presenting some examples of application. Their use to infer biological knowledge will be shown, and a special attention will be devoted to the topological and module analysis.	6.0
There is substantial evidence that non-B27 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are associated with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Studies in Mexican and Tunisian populations demonstrated the association of SpA and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B15. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of HLA-A, B, and DR antigens in a group of Colombian patients with a diagnosis of SpA. A total of 189 patients and 100 healthy subjects were included in the present study. All subjects underwent a complete characterization of HLA alleles A, B, and DR. Of the 189 studied patients, 35 were reactive arthritis (ReA), 87 were ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and 67 undifferentiated SpA (uSpA). According to the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria, 167 were axial SpA (axSpA) and 171 were peripheral SpA (pSpA). 63.8% were men, with a mean age of 35.9 +/- 12.7 years. 40.7% (77/189) of patients were HLA-B27 positive of which 52.9% had AS and 42.5% axSpA. 23.2% (44/189) of patients were HLA-B15 positive: 23.8% were uSpA, 12.57% were axSpA, and 11.7% were pSpA. In addition, HLA-DRB1*01 was associated with AS (58.6%) and axSpA (42.5%). Also, HLA-DRB1*04 was present in 62 patients with AS (71.2%) and in 26 with axSpA (15.5%). In this population, we found a strong association between the presence of HLA-B27 and the diagnosis of axSpA and AS, but the HLA-B15 is also significantly associated with all subtypes of the disease, predominantly with pSpA. Additionally, HLA-DR1 and DR4 were associated in a cohort of patients with SpA from Colombia.	5.3
Machine learning models for site of metabolism (SoM) prediction offer the ability to identify metabolic soft spots in low-molecular-weight drug molecules at low computational cost and enable data-based reactivity prediction. SoM prediction is an atom classification problem. Successful construction of machine learning models requires atom representations that capture the reactivity-determining features of a potential reaction site. We have developed a descriptor scheme that characterizes an atom's steric and electronic environment and its relative location in the molecular structure. The partial charge distributions were obtained from fast quantum mechanical calculations. We successfully trained machine learning classifiers on curated cytochrome P450 metabolism data. The models based on the new atom descriptors showed sustained accuracy for retrospective analyses of metabolism optimization campaigns and lead optimization projects from Bayer Pharmaceuticals. The results obtained demonstrate the practicality of quantum-chemistry-supported machine learning models for hit-to-lead optimization.	0.1
Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the limited landfill spaces, water pollution, energy consumption and harmful gas emissions. Proper management of demolition waste (DW) is a complex process and requires systematic thinking and analysis. Many methods have been proposed to study the environmental impact assessment of demolition waste management (DWM). However, it is found that the currently available studies pay little attention from the perspective of complex adaptive system (CAS) to consider the attitude and interaction of the heterogeneous stakeholders as well as the importance of green DWM which has a great influence on the effectiveness of DW management. The aim of this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence the environmental performance of DWM. To achieve this aim, a model for evaluating the environmental impact of DWM was developed by using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The main factors considered in the model are the ratio of green deconstruction (i.e., building deconstruction) managers vs. conventional demolition (i.e. building destruction) managers, the ratio of green design managers (i.e. design for deconstruction) vs. conventional design managers, and the interaction behavior of heterogeneous stakeholders following the herd theory. In the model, the environmental impact assessment was quantified into four categories i.e. land resources, water resources, air resource and energy resources. The proposed model is demonstrated by using the data drawn from the Chinese construction industry. The results reveal that if the deconstruction method and the deconstruction oriented design are widely adopted by architects and engineers, the negative environmental impacts generated by DW can be reduced by at least 50%. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for government departments to make decisions on how to improve environmental performance of DWM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	4.4
Beaver Slide is near 177.8km (110.5mi) on the Dalton Highway and the road gradient is approximately 11%, built on a hill side. Each year, soft spots, also commonly named as frost boils, were observed starting from late April and lasting for the entire summer. The frost boils have resulted in an extremely unsafe driving condition and frequent accident occurrences. Conventional repair methods cannot effectively solve this issue. A newly developed geotextile, which has high specific surface area, was installed in the selected test section to mitigate the frost-boil issue in August 2010. This type of geotextile can provide high wettability and relatively high suction (capillary force), consequently be able to laterally transport water (a high-directional transmissivity) under unsaturated conditions. Test results over the initial 2years had proved the effectiveness of the geotextile to alleviate frost heave and the subsequent thaw-weakening issue. However, there were still some concerns regarding its long-term performance, such as clogging of the microscopic drainage channels and mechanical failures. The data collected during the past 5 years were used to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the wicking fabric. A scanning electron microscope was used to explore the interaction between the wicking fabric and in situ soils, and to determine the condition of the fabric 5 years after the installation.

Nitrogen (N) fertilizers are critical in today's agriculture especially in the United States. Leaching, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from N fertilizer use and the implications for global climate and water pollution raised serious concerns among environmentalists and agronomists. Prices of N fertilizers increased geometrically over the past few years. The projected increase in maize (Zea mays L.) ethanol production is expected to increase N fertilizer demand and prices. Hay prices are, however, staggering and producers are looking for alternatives to N fertilizers. This review paper assessed trends in fertilizer use and prices as well as factors affecting fixation and transfer of dinitrogen (N-2) in forage production systems. Additionally, economic implications of using N fertilizers and grass-legume mixtures are discussed. From the review, it was apparent that legumes have the potential to replace N fertilizers or at least complement the use of N fertilizers in forage production systems. However, N transfer in forage production systems is low. A lot more research is needed to answer the question Why legumes fix so much N-2 and transfer just a small proportion to other crops. Similarly, identifying compatible grass-legume species that enhance N-2 fixation will be a giant step towards reduced N fertilizer use and ensuring environmental sustainability. With the sharp increase in N fertilizer prices, the use of legumes in forage production systems seems promising.	4.4
Accurate estimates of biomass are required for relating ecosystem functioning to atmospheric carbon regulation. Biomass may be directly measured through field sampling, which can then be used to calibrate biomass predictions from remote sensing and/or modelling. Field sampling generally entails measuring the fresh mass of individual trees or shrubs and then estimating the moisture contents of a representative sub-samples, which are then used to calculate dry mass. Because any errors in the estimation of the moisture content (MC) correction are translated proportionally to the biomass prediction of an individual tree or shrub, care is required to ensure MC estimates are unbiased and as precise as possible. There are numerous different protocols currently applied to attain MC, with these differing in accuracy (bias and precision) and cost of implementation. A dataset of MC of above-ground biomass (AGB) of 1396 individuals (trees or shrubs) was used to assess which protocols for within- and among-individual sampling are likely to provide the most cost-effective estimates of MC within acceptable bounds of accuracy. Monte Carlo analysis was used to explore key sources of error in within-individual MC estimation. Results suggest these MC estimates may be based on at least the bole and crown components of AGB, with bias resulting if MC is based on stem wood only, particularly in young (or small) individuals. Little gain in accuracy was attained with more intensive sub-sampling (e.g. into foliage, twig, branches, bark, and stem wood components). Moreover, further efficiencies may be gained by applying existing empirical models to estimate the proportion of AGB that is crown based on easily measured variables such as stem diameter, thereby avoiding the resource-intensive process of partitioning to obtain fresh weights measurements of components. However to minimise bias, it is important to undertake MC sampling at each study site, and to stratify sampling among-individuals by both appropriate taxonomic grouping (e.g. plant functional type) and age-class. For a given plant functional type-by-size (or age) strata at a given site a precision of about 4% coefficient of variation of the average MC estimate can be achieved with intensive within- and among-individual sampling. However a precision of 8-10% is achievable using our recommended less intensive but more efficient protocol; derive an average MC for at least six individuals, and for each individual, intensively sub-sample bole and crown components for MC, which is then applied to the fresh weights of these components. This latter estimate may be obtained from partitioning of the AGB, or for the highest efficiency, from predictions obtained from the application of existing representative empirical relationships of partitioning based on the size of the individual.

Maintenance and repair of the highway network system are major expenses in the state budget. For this reason various concerned organizations are pointing out the need for developing an intelligent and efficient pavement performance model that can prioritize pavement maintenance and rehabilitation works. Such models can forecast the remaining pavement service life and pavement rehabilitation needs, and can help in the formulation of pavement maintenance and strengthening programmes which will reduce the road agency and road user costs. The flexible pavement performance or deterioration models involve the complex interaction between vehicles and the environment, and the structure and surface of the pavement. Performance models relating to the pavement distress conditions like, cracking, raveling, potholing, and roughness are analyzed and developed by various researchers. But most of these models are found applicable to a particular set of traffic or environment conditions, thus highlighting the need of model(s) that can work in varied conditions satisfactorily. The paper presents a detailed review of various pavement performance models to examine the role of factors related to pavement materials, environmental conditions, type of traffic and volume of traffic, and to identify the limitations and gaps in the present knowledge on such models.	4.1
Background: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can offer compelling evidence for protein function, especially when viewed in the context of proteome-wide interactomes. Bacteria have been popular subjects of interactome studies: more than six different bacterial species have been the subjects of comprehensive interactome studies while several more have had substantial segments of their proteomes screened for interactions. The protein interactomes of several bacterial species have been completed, including several from prominent human pathogens. The availability of interactome data has brought challenges, as these large data sets are difficult to compare across species, limiting their usefulness for broad studies of microbial genetics and evolution. Results: In this study, we use more than 52,000 unique protein-protein interactions ( PPIs) across 349 different bacterial species and strains to determine their conservation across data sets and taxonomic groups. When proteins are collapsed into orthologous groups (OGs) the resulting meta-interactome still includes more than 43,000 interactions, about 14,000 of which involve proteins of unknown function. While conserved interactions provide support for protein function in their respective species data, we found only 429 PPIs (similar to 1% of the available data) conserved in two or more species, rendering any cross-species interactome comparison immediately useful. The meta-interactome serves as a model for predicting interactions, protein functions, and even full interactome sizes for species with limited to no experimentally observed PPI, including Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica which are predicted to have up to 18,000 and 31,000 PPIs, respectively. Conclusions: In the course of this work, we have assembled cross-species interactome comparisons that will allow interactomics researchers to anticipate the structures of yet-unexplored microbial interactomes and to focus on well-conserved yet uncharacterized interactors for further study. Such conserved interactions should provide evidence for important but yet-uncharacterized aspects of bacterial physiology and may provide targets for anti-microbial therapies.	6.4
The paper presents a study leading to a new acute toxicity test on embryonic and juvenile organisms of the great pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis Linnaeus). Sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and ammonium hydroxide were used as waterborne toxicants in laboratory experiments. The exposure time was 24 h. Tests were conducted in 5-10 replications for each toxicant. The toxicity of the substances was classified according to different scales and the test's sensitivity was compared to that of the commonly used bioindicator Daphnia magna Straus. The assessment of toxicity impact was supported by microscopic observations. The probit method was used as a parametric statistical procedure to estimate LC50 and the associated 95% confidence interval. Our study showed that the early developmental stages of Lymnaea stagnalis are very sensitive bioindicators, making it possible to detect even very low levels of the above-mentioned water toxicants. The highest toxicity is shown by ammonium hydroxide with LC50/24h values, respectively, 24.27 for embryos and 24.72 for juvenile forms, and the lowest is shown by nitric acid ions with LC50/24h values, respectively, 105.19 for embryos and 170.47 for juvenile forms. It is highly cost-effective due to simple and efficient breeding and the small size of the organisms in the bioassay population. Compared with Daphnia magna, relatively low concentrations of toxicants caused a lethal effect on embryonic and juvenile organisms of the great pond snail. Owing to their common occurrence and sensitivity, early developmental forms of Lymnaea stagnalis can be a valuable new tool in biomonitoring of the freshwater environment.	4.4
Persistent organic pollutants like organochlorine pesticides continue to contaminate large areas worldwide raising questions concerning their management. We designed and tested a method to link soil and water pollution in the watershed of the Galion River in Martinique. We first estimated the risk of soil contamination by chlordecone by referring to past use of land for banana cultivation and took 27 soil samples. We then sampled surface waters at 39 points and groundwater at 16 points. We tested three hypotheses linked to the source of chlordecone pollution at the watershed scale: (i) soils close to the river, (ii) soils close to the sampling point, (iii) throughout the sub-watershed generated at the sampling point. Graphical and statistical analysis showed that contamination of the river increased when it passed through an area with contaminated plots and decreased when it passed through area not contaminated by chlordecone. Modeling showed that the entire surface area of the watershed contributed to river pollution, suggesting that the river was mainly being contaminated by the aquifers and groundwater flows. Our method proved to be a reliable way to identify areas polluted by chlordecone at the watershed scale and should help stakeholders focus their management actions on both hot spots and the whole watershed.

Machine Design is the most perspective field of study in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME) at the University of West Bohemia with regards to the demand for graduates in this field. These days, the main issue of higher education in the Czech Republic related to Machine Design is the lack of opportunities for students of Machine Design to acquire practical knowledge and experience in the field. The problem is that engineering companies offer work experience only to individual students as they try to hire them after graduation. But engineering companies are not motivated enough to contribute to the Machine Design teaching process by providing knowledge and experience to the majority of students. As this is not going to change soon, universities have to provide real applications to its students instead. Currently, there are not enough opportunities for students to acquire practical knowledge in the field during their studies. The required amount of work experience for engineering students in the Czech Republic is only one week, which is insufficient in comparison with the German system, where internship semesters are a mandatory part of studying at a Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences). It is necessary to provide practical information and real applications in class to compensate for the lack of practical experience. FME is concerned in this matter and it has launched the project for enhancement of the teaching process. A new concept of electronic learning materials for Machine Design was developed as a part of the project. The learning materials were developed by academics in cooperation with local engineering companies to provide students and academics at FME with real design projects reworked for learning purposes. The Machine Design teaching process is complicated due to the complexity of the mechanical design process, as it has its own particularities which need to be considered while creating learning materials. When describing the mechanical design process, not only the design process itself has to be described. Also the production processes, project schedules, economic aspects of the design project, legislative, technical standards and regulations have to be described as well. As these parts of the mechanical design process affect each other, it is important to describe them in the context of the mechanical design process to show the interconnection between them. The electronic form of learning materials was selected as it offers many advantages over the standard printed form. The main reason for selecting the electronic form of learning materials is the ability to work with Computer-aided engineering (CAE) models. Three-dimensional CAE models replaced drawing boards in every engineering company several years ago and thus it is important to include CAE models in the Machine Design teaching process. Thanks to the technology of exporting CAE models to the standard portable document format (PDF) it is possible to modify CAE models for learning purposes and use them as a learning tool. CAE models can be enhanced with a large amount of information regarding a design project such as manufacturing processes, materials or component functions and can be supplemented by technical drawings, illustrated project descriptions and further information. All the learning material is converted into a single PDF file so that every student can access it anywhere, anytime. Versatility and interactivity are the biggest benefits of the new electronic learning materials. The new electronic learning materials can be used when explaining new subject matter to show its application, or as a basis for students' assignments, individual work, teamwork or dissertations. The sample electronic learning materials are being produced and will be made available to students through the courseware of the University of West Bohemia. This paper intends to present the learning materials and describe their form, structure and content and their benefits for academics and students of Machine Design.	3.3
This study was intended to analyze the intersection of experience of sexual stigma low-socioeconomic status, and suicide attempt amongst young Brazilians (11-24 years old). In each of the data collection periods (2004-2006: n = 7185; 2010-2012: n = 2734), participants completed a questionnaire-based instrument. Network analysis provided support for a Minority Stress Model, oriented around whether participants had experienced sexual stigma. Although suicide attempts decreased by 20% for participants who had not experienced sexual stigma, there was a 60% increase for those who had experienced sexual stigma. Of particular note were the increases in rates of reported community and familial physical assault, molestation, and rape for those who had experienced sexual stigma. An analysis of centrality statistics demonstrated that both experiences of this Minority Stress Model were fundamentally different, and that those disparities increased over the time frame observed in this study. At the center of this model, shortest paths statistics exhibited a direct conditioned connection between experiencing sexual stigma and suicide attempts. We discuss the social and historical contexts that contributed to these dynamics, and emphasize the need for policy change.	2.0
Herein we report the synthesis and activity of an enzyme-directed immunostimulant with immune cell activation mediated by -galactosidase, either exogenously added, or on B16 melanoma cells. Covalent attachment of a -galactopyranoside to an imidazoquinoline immunostimulant at a position critical for activity resulted in a pro-immunostimulant that could be selectively converted by -galactosidase into an active immunostimulant. The pro-immunostimulant exhibited -galactosidase-directed immune cell activation as measured by NF-B transcription in RAW-Blue macrophages or cytokine production (TNF, IL-6, IL-12) in JAWSII monocytes. Conversion of the pro-immunostimulant into an active immunostimulant was also found to occur using -galactosidase-enriched B16 melanoma cells. In co-culture experiments with either immune cell line, -galactosidase-enriched B16 cells effected activation of bystander immune cells.	6.3
Recent years have witnessed a processor development trend that integrates central processing unit (CPU) and graphic processing unit (GPU) into a single chip. The integration helps to save some host-device data copying that a discrete GPU usually requires, but also introduces deep resource sharing and possible interference between CPU and GPU. This work investigates the performance implications of independently co-running CPU and GPU programs on these platforms. First, we perform a comprehensive measurement that covers a wide variety of factors, including processor architectures, operating systems, benchmarks, timing mechanisms, inputs, and power management schemes. These measurements reveal a number of surprising observations.We analyze these observations and produce a list of novel insights, including the important roles of operating system (OS) context switching and power management in determining the program performance, and the subtle effect of CPU-GPU data copying. Finally, we confirm those insights through case studies, and point out some promising directions to mitigate anomalous performance degradation on integrated heterogeneous processors.	0.4
Representational State Transfer (REST) web services has gained popular acceptance over the world-wide-web as a straightforward choice to the traditional or SOAP-based services. However, at present the REST-based service implementation does not have pre-defined security protection methods. In this paper, we present a defense mechanism against REST-based web service attacks called the REST-IDS, for a defense-in-depth network security in web service layer. REST-IDS is an intelligent mechanism that employs statistical approach to the stateof-the-art Text Mining-Based Anomaly Detection (TMAD) model to detect unknown novel vulnerabilities, which is sensitive to payload attacks.	0.2
The main aim of this study was to objectify the treatment assignment criteria used in a clinical centre for addiction treatment in Spain. A sample of 162 patients (87 inpatients and 75 outpatients) who sought treatment between 2010 and 2012 was assessed. Clinical characteristics (addiction severity, psychopathological symptoms, impulsiveness and maladjustment) of the two treatment groups (inpatient and outpatient) into which patients were assigned according to the clinical criteria of therapists were analysed to identify which variables were more relevant for patient placement. Moreover, the therapeutic progression of patients who met and did not meet the assignment criteria received was studied. According to the results, a score above 4 in the family/social support area of the European Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI), or, in cases of a score between 2 and 4 in the family/social area of EuropASI, a score above 2 in the partner subscale of the Maladjustment Scale correctly classified 73.5% of cases (96.6% of inpatients and 46.7% of outpatients). Comparisons of therapeutic results depending on matching or mismatching these assignment criteria showed a larger effect size in mismatching patient assignment criteria for outpatient treatment. The results obtained in this study provide an objective criterion for addicted patient placement. Moreover, from a cost-effective perspective, they question the necessity of inpatient treatment in most cases, demonstrating that outpatient treatment is a sufficient level of care. This study addresses the approach to assigning patients to the treatment modality that best fits them, implementing the least expensive level of care needed to achieve treatment success.

The software support for simulation of electrical circuits has been developed for more than sixty years. Currently, the standard tools for simulation of analogous circuits are the simulators based on the open source package Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis generally known as SPICE (Biolek 2003). There are many different applications that provide graphical interface and extended functionalities on the basis of SPICE or, at least, using SPICE models of electronic devices. The author of this paper performed a simulation of a circuit that acts as an electronic diode in Multisim and provides a comparison of the simulation results with the results obtained from measurements on the real circuit.	1.2
This paper presents a method of the determination of a minimal stable realisation of the fractional continuous-time linear system with different fractional orders. For the proposed method, a digraph-based algorithm was constructed. In this paper, we have shown how we can perform the transfer matrix using electrical circuits consisting of resistances, inductances, capacitances and source voltages. The proposed method was discussed and illustrated with some numerical examples.	1.2
Ranking items is an essential problem in recommendation systems. Since comparing two items is the simplest type of queries in order to measure the relevance of items, the problem of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking has been widely studied. Furthermore, ranking with pairwise comparisons has recently received a lot of attention in crowdsourcing systems where binary comparative queries can be used effectively to make assessments faster for precise rankings. In order to learn a ranking based on a training set of queries and their labels obtained from annotators, machine learning algorithms are generally used to find the appropriate ranking model which describes the data set the best. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for learning multiple latent rankings by using pairwise comparisons. Our novel model can capture multiple hidden rankings underlying the pairwise comparisons. Based on the model, we develop an efficient inference algorithm to learn multiple latent rankings as well as an effective inference algorithm for active learning to update the model parameters in crowdsourcing systems whenever new pairwise comparisons are supplied. The performance study with synthetic and real-life data sets confirms the effectiveness of our model and inference algorithms.	0.1
In the design of nuclear power plants, various natural circulation passive cooling systems are considered to remove residual heat from the reactor core in the event of a power loss and maintain the plant's safety. These passive systems rely on gravity differences of fluids, resulting from density differentials, rather than using an external power-driven system. Unfortunately, a major drawback of such systems is their weak driving force, which can negatively impact safety. In such systems, there is a temperature difference between the heat source and the heat sink, which potentially offers a natural platform for thermoelectric generator (TEG) applications. While a previous study designed and analyzed a TEG-based passive core cooling system, this paper considers TEG applications in other passive cooling systems of nuclear power plants, after which the concept of a TEG-based passive cooling system is proposed. In such a system, electricity is produced using the system's temperature differences through the TEG, and this electricity is used to further enhance the cooling process.	1.0
Sediment transport is an important aspect of soil erosion, and sediment transport capacity (T-c) is a key to establishing process -based erosion models. A lot of studies exist that have determined T-c for overland flow, however, few studies have been conducted to determine T-c for loess sediments on steep slopes. Experimental data for this region are thus needed. The objectives of this study are to formulate new equations to describe T-c and evaluate the suitability of these equations for loess sediments on steep slopes. The slope gradients in this study ranged from 10.51% to 38.39%, and flow discharges per unit width varied from 1.11 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) to 3.78 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1). Results showed that 11 increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope gradient, with R-2 = 0.99 and Nash -SuT(c)liffe model efficiency (NSE) = 0.99. T, was more sensitive to flow discharge than slope gradient. T-c increased as a power function with mean flow velocity, which was satisfied to predict T-c with R-2 = 0.99 and NSE = 0.99. Shear stress (R2 = 0.89, NSE = 0.88) was also a good predictor of T-c, and stream power (R-2 = 0.96, NSE = 0.96) was a better predictor of T-c than shear stress. However, unit stream power was not a good predictor to estimate T-c in our study, with R-2 = 0.63 and NSE = 0.62. These findings offer a new approach for predicting T-c for loess sediments on steep slopes. 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	3.1
This paper proposes an image encryption scheme based on Cellular Automata (CA). CA is a self-organizing structure with a set of cells in which each cell is updated by certain rules that are dependent on a limited number of neighboring cells. The major disadvantages of cellular automata in cryptography include limited number of reversal rules and inability to produce long sequences of states by these rules. In this paper, a non-uniform cellular automata framework is proposed to solve this problem. This proposed scheme consists of confusion and diffusion steps. In confusion step, the positions of the original image pixels are replaced by chaos mapping. Key image is created using non-uniform cellular automata and then the hyper-chaotic mapping is used to select random numbers from the image key for encryption. The main contribution of the paper is the application of hyper chaotic functions and non-uniform CA for robust key image generation. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method has a very large key space and is resistive against noise and attacks. The correlation between adjacent pixels in the encrypted image is reduced and the amount of entropy is equal to 7.9991 which is very close to 8 which is ideal.	0.3
The present study presents a new experimental technique to measure friction angle between soil and Geosynthetic Clay Liner (GCL). The method in question avoids some deficiencies observed on the inclined plane and pullout tests. Moreover, the technique allows observing the GCL tensile behaviour. The experimental frame is easy to build in usual geotechnical laboratory. The one employed is made-up in civil engineering Department of Ouargla University (Algeria). It is usable for testing both GCLs and other geosynthetic materials. Also, it permits to apply various experimental conditions (like slide velocity, confining pressure and water content) to the tested materials. The present method highlights that the soil-GCL interaction is, actually, a combination of two loading forces: soil-GCL interface friction and pure traction of the GCL material. The obtained results allow evaluating both soil-GCL angle of friction and intrinsic stiffness of the GCL in relation with the confining pressure.	4.1
Like most other things, fracking has its good and bad points. In the former regard, it is a technological breakthrough that can increase the supplies of energy of the entire economy. In the latter, it has been linked with an increased incidence of earthquakes and water pollution, surely negatives. As well, there is some evidence fracking would not exist, at least not to the present extent, were it not for government subsidies, which, we argue, misallocate resources.	4.4
Background and aimsCognitive impairment has been associated with excessive alcohol use, but its neural basis is poorly understood. Chronic excessive alcohol use in adolescence may lead to neuronal loss and volumetric changes in the brain. Our objective was to compare the grey matter volumes of heavy- and light-drinking adolescents. DesignThis was a longitudinal study: heavy-drinking adolescents without an alcohol use disorder and their light-drinking controls were followed-up for 10 years using questionnaires at three time-points. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at the last time-point. SettingThe area near Kuopio University Hospital, Finland. ParticipantsThe 62 participants were aged 22-28years and included 35 alcohol users and 27 controls who had been followed-up for approximately 10 years. MeasurementsAlcohol use was measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)-C at three time-points during 10years. Participants were selected based on their AUDIT-C score. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at the last time-point. Grey matter volume was determined and compared between heavy- and light-drinking groups using voxel-based morphometry on three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance images using predefined regions of interest and a threshold of P<0.05, with small volume correction applied on cluster level. FindingsGrey matter volumes were significantly smaller among heavy-drinking participants in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, right orbitofrontal and frontopolar cortex, right superior temporal gyrus and right insular cortex compared to the control group (P<0.05, family-wise error-corrected cluster level). ConclusionsExcessive alcohol use during adolescence appears to be associated with an abnormal development of the brain grey matter. Moreover, the structural changes detected in the insula of alcohol users may reflect a reduced sensitivity to alcohol's negative subjective effects.	5.0
Smart environments possess devices that collaborate to help the user non-intrusively. One possible aid smart environment offer is to anticipate user's tasks and perform them on his/her behalf or facilitate the action completion. In this paper, we propose a framework that predicts user's actions by learning his/her behavior when interacting with the smart environment. We prepare the datasets and train a predictor that is responsible to decide whether a target transducer value should be changed or not. Our solution achieves a significant improvement for all target transducers studied and most combinations of parameters yields better results than the base case.	4.0
It is hard to estimate optical flow given a realworld video sequence with camera shake and other motion blur. In this paper, we first investigate the blur parameterisation for video footage using near linear motion elements. We then combine a commercial 3D pose sensor with an RGB camera, in order to film video footage of interest together with the camera motion. We illustrate that this additional camera motion/trajectory channel can be embedded into a hybrid framework by interleaving an iterative blind deconvolution and warping based optical flow scheme. Our method yields improved accuracy within three other state-of-the-art baselines given our proposed ground truth blurry sequences; and several other realworld sequences filmed by our imaging system.	0.0
The discrete-time robust disturbance attenuation problem for the n-degrees of freedom (dof) mechanical systems with uncertain energy function is considered in this paper. First, it is shown in the continuous time-setting that the robust control problem of n-dof mechanical systems can be reduced to a disturbance attenuation problem when a specific type of control rule is used. Afterwards, the robust disturbance attenuation problem is formulised as a special disturbance attenuation problem. Then, the discrete-time counterpart of this problem characterised by means of L-2 gain is given. Finally, a solution of the problem via direct-discrete-time design is presented as a sufficient condition. The proposed discrete-time design utilizes discrete gradient of the energy function of considered system. Therefore, a new method is also proposed using the quadratic approximation lemma to construct discrete gradients for general energy functions. The proposed direct-discrete-time design method is used to solve the robust disturbance attenuation problem for the double pendulum system. Simulation results are given for the discrete gradient obtained with the method presented in this paper. Note that the solution presented here for the robust disturbance attenuation problem give an explicit algebraic condition on the design parameter, whereas solution of the same problem requires solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential inequality in general nonlinear systems.	1.4
This research addresses three important issues regarding interpersonal expectancy effects and communication across various modalities. The phenomena of behavioral confirmation and disconfirmation were tested in an original experiment involving 148 participants using computer-mediated communication (CMC). First, this study tested a boundary condition asserted by previous theorists about whether or not confirmation and disconfirmation could occur in communication channels without nonverbal communication. Secondly, it shed light on an important causal variable of perceived malleability of interpersonal expectancies in a novel, simultaneous test of confirmation and disconfirmation. Lastly, it verified the hyperpersonal model of CMC by demonstrating behavioral confirmation, and extended the model by specifying when disconfirmation occurs online.	2.3
Conserving water resources and protecting them from the pollution are of high importance in natural cycle of our life. Nitrate, as one of the important sources of water pollution, is a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems, and due to its high solubility, its extraction from the water is a costly process. Providing a reliable, low cost and fast method is necessary for eliminating pollution. This study tried to determine the refining potential and capacity of Eichhornia crassipes for removing nitrate from the water. Factors such as initial concentration of nitrate, contact time, absorbent mass, pH and the presence of other competing ions such as sulfate on nitrate absorption have been studied. The results showed that the best efficiency of nitrate removal, more than 99%, in the optimum condition (the retention time of 30 hours, absorbent dose three plants (15 stems) and pH = 6.4) occurred. In addition, the efficiency of nitrate removal in the presence of sulfate ions did not reduce. By increasing the initial nitrate concentration, from 30 to 150 mg/L, there was no significant change in removal efficiency. Actually, by increasing absorbent mass, removal time increased from 67.96% to 100%. The process of nitrate absorption followed Langmuir isotherm (R-2 = 1). However, the results showed that Eichhornia crassipes, a promising plant with great functionality, can be used as a refiner for removing nitrate and it is a simple, efficient and low cost method.	4.4
In this article, the load-settlement characteristics of unreinforced and reinforced two-layered soil during the loading process are investigated. A series of bearing ratio tests was performed on a granular soil as the base layer overlaying a cohesive soil as the subgrade layer. Three reinforcing conditions (unreinforced, reinforced with nonwoven geotextile, and reinforced with geogrid) at the interface of layers, with four compaction moisture contents (CMCs) of the subgrade layer and three thicknesses of the base layer for both soaked and non-soaked conditions are considered. The results show that the CMC of the subgrade layer has a significant effect on the behavior of two-layered soil, such as swelling amount and the efficiency of the reinforcements. Reinforcing with geogrid resulted in a considerable increase in strength of the soaked samples due to adhesion between geogrids and clayey subgrade layer. For nonwoven geotextiles, strength of the two-layered soil decreased at shallow penetration depths due to reinforcements; and as the penetration increased in depth, the strength also increased. Also, it was found that with decreases in base layer thickness, the test variable's value (i.e., CMC), and the type of geosynthetic reinforcement have significant effects on the behavior of two-layered soil.	4.1
The prevalence of antisocial behavior in school settings is still discouraging. Students that often engage in aggressive acts may lack in the ability to appreciate the emotional consequences of their behaviors and share others' emotions. The Children's Empathic Attitudes Questionnaire (CEAQ) is one of the questionnaires used to assess empathy in children and early adolescents. This study is aimed to validate the Spanish version of CEAQ. The sample comprised 297 children (50% males), aged from 7 to 12 years (M = 9.53, SD = 1.2), from Madrid. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated an excellent fit for a unidimensional model, chi(2)(89) = 110.702, p = .059; CFI = .972; RMSEA = .029, 95% CI [.000,.045]. Multigroup invariance analysis showed no significant gender-related differences in all levels. Results also referred an acceptable reliability (omega = .824, r = .610). These results provide psychometric support for the use of the Spanish version of CEAQ as a valid and reliable instrument to assess empathy in children and youth population, especially for school-based interventions.	2.4
Background: Sex chromosome aneuploidies occur in approximately one in 420 live births. The most frequent abnormalities are 45, X (Turner syndrome), 47, XXX (triple X), 47, XXY (Klinefelter syndrome), and 47, XYY. The prevalence of males with more than one extra sex chromosome (e.g. 48, XXYY or 48, XXXY) is less common. However, the literature provides little information about the cognitive and behavioural phenotype and the natural history of the disease. We report the clinical, neurocognitive, social cognitive and psychiatric characterization of a patient with 49, XYYYY syndrome. Case presentation: The patient presented with a complex phenotype including a particular cognitive profile with intellectual deficiency and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with limited interests. Moreover, social anxiety disorder with selective mutism and separation anxiety disorder were observed (DSM-5 criteria, MINI Assessment). Conclusion: It is now admitted that 49, XYYYY has unique medical, neurodevelopmental and behavioural characteristics. Interestingly, ASD is more common in groups with Y chromosome aneuploidy. This clinical report suggests that understanding the cognitive and social functioning of these patients may provide new insights into possible therapeutic strategies, as cognitive remediation or social cognitive training.	2.1
The purpose of this study was to analyze the swing characteristics of the kicking leg in order to elucidate the technical mechanisms of the drive curve shot (topspin curve shot). The orientation of the ankle joint at the point of ball impact closely resembles the orientation during a general curve shot or inside shot. Moreover, for the ankle joint movement at the point of ball impact, there is less mediolateral movement (y direction) compared to a curve shot, and more movement in the vertical direction (z direction). Based on the fact that the angle of the vertical rotational axis at that point is larger than that in other shots, this is likely to be one of the factors in generating topspin on the ball. Therefore, we believe that some of the most important and fundamental characteristics of drive curve shots are a smaller angle of attack and a larger vertical movement of the ankle joint at the point of impact, as compared to normal curve shots.

Social cognition is fundamentally interpersonal: individuals' behaviour and dispositions critically affect their interaction partners' information processing. However, cognitive neuroscience studies, partially because of methodological constraints, have remained largely perceiver-centric: focusing on the abilities, motivations, and goals of social perceivers while largely ignoring interpersonal effects. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the neural bases of perceiving emotionally expressive and inexpressive social targets. Sixteen perceivers were scanned using fMRI while they watched targets discussing emotional autobiographical events. Perceivers continuously rated each target's emotional state or eye-gaze direction. The effects of targets' emotional expressivity on perceiver's brain activity depended on task set: when perceivers explicity attended to targets' emotions, expressivity predicted activity in neural structures-including medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex-associated with drawing inferences about mental states. When perceivers instead attended to targets' eye-gaze, target expressivity predicted activity in regions-including somatosensory cortex, fusiform gyrus, and motor cortex-associated with monitoring sensorimotor states and biological motion. These findings suggest that expressive targets affect information processing in manner that depends on perceivers' goals. More broadly, these data provide an early step toward understanding the neural bases of interpersonal social cognition.	2.2
Mobile devices including popular smartphone contributes to efficiency improvement of on-site data processing. Mobile environment for real-time data processing needs some additional aspects besides desktop ones, as the style of mobile app, mobile web and mobile web app. Generally, mobile app provides internal storage service so that offline data processing is possible. But mobile app needs separate development according to different types of devices or operating systems, even to different sizes of display panel of mobile devices. Geo-based data are composed of vector and raster formats from complex structure, compared to other data sets including image data and multimedia data. Hence, even though mobile applications development for geo-based data is more complicated than other ones, users' demands with respect to geo-based data processing functionalities on mobile environment are increasing in these days. Mobile web supported by technical basis of HyperText Markup Language5 (HTML5) is regarded as useful service type combining geo-based data processing modules and mobile environments, because it does not require user' downloading or installation of programs and just needs web browsers. Indexed DB Application Programming Interface (API) within this international web standard provides offline data storage functions on mobile environment. Using this API, data sets can be permanently stored into mobile devices, not cache memory. Among numerous geo-data functionalities, visualization topic is basically and commonly used in most mobile services. This study presents an implementation case of mobile web app with geobased data visualization processing on online and offline mode. Types of geo-based data sets are base map of Open Street Map (OSM), OSM vector layers with Extensible Markup Language (XML) contents and high resolution satellite images of optical sensor. It is thought that the result of this implementation can play a role to create intelligent mobile application fields using both geo-based data sets and earth observation satellite image sets.	0.4
The temperature recovering curve derived by cold stimulation experiment reveals human inner metabolism status. The changes of the curve involve many heat-influence factors in which metabolic heat-production is the most important. This paper adopts Tikhonove regularization method to eliminate the measured infrared image data errors and constructs a numerical model based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to compute two main heat components heat transfer quantity of blood perfusion and heat-production quantity of metabolism. Different component results are obtained in two typical recovering curves. And the metabolic heat-production quantity comparisons between the diabetic and the healthy show that the metabolic function of the healthy are much better than that of the diabetic numerically. This provides a novel method to estimate the human metabolism quantitatively.	6.2
Classroom observation is an important part of language teacher education (Kelly & Grenfell 2004) but its effects could be enhanced through observation and guided analysis of video-recorded lessons. As a Matter of fact, focus on teacher talk and on its specific conversational patterns (Sinclair 1982, Sinclair & Brazil 1982) could be of great benefit on teacher education. Moreover, digital data (audio, video and text) presenting natural speech in context would be a relevant tool for teacher trainers, in order to help their trainees to develop teaching awareness and interaction ability, especially if such data are easily and freely accessible and properly treated through new methods of computer-based multimodal analysis. In this study we have analysed, through a multimodal approach, teacher talk questioning in several L2 and LS Italian classrooms. Questioning is one of the most common techniques used by teachers (Richards, 1996) and serves as the principal way in which teachers control the classroom interaction. In some classrooms over half of class time is taken up by question-and-answer exchanges (Richards, 1996). We have focused on two main types of questions: display questions and referential questions. Through the usage of some video-recorded lessons, transcribed and subtitled, we have investigated the presence and relevance of non-linguistic patterns, that match with regularity with these linguistic phenomena. Particularly, we have examined specific non-verbal and para-verbal activities made by the speakers, tightly linked to the various types of questions, and we have noted that there are recurring behaviours used together with the over mentioned linguistic structures, to express specific communicative and didactic scopes and functions, that is to say to build and spread knowledge in a L2/LS Italian classroom.	2.3
Volvariella volvacea is difficult to store fresh because of the lack of low-temperature resistance. Many traditional mutagenic strategies have been applied in order to select out strains resistant to low temperature, but few commercially efficient strains have been produced. In order to break through the bottleneck of traditional breeding and significantly improve low-temperature resistance of the edible fungus V. volvacea, strains resistant to low temperature were constructed by genome shuffling. The optimum conditions of V. volvacea strain mutation, protoplast regeneration, and fusion were determined. After protoplasts were treated with 1% (v/v) ethylmethylsulfonate (EMS), 40Sec of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, 600 Gy electron beam implantation, and 750 Gy(60)Co- irradiation, separately, the lethality was within 70%-80%, which favored generating protoplasts being used in following forward mutation. Under these conditions, 16 strains of V. volvacea mutated by EMS, electron beam, UV irradiation, and Co-60- irradiation were obtained. The 16 mutated protoplasts were selected to serve as the shuffling pool based on their excellent low-temperature resistance. After four rounds of genome shuffling and low-temperature resistance testing, three strains (VF1, VF2, and VF3) with high genetic stability were screened. VF1, VF2, and VF3 significantly enhanced fruit body shelf life to 20, 28, and 28H at 10 degrees C, respectively, which exceeded 25%, 75%, and 75%, respectively, compared with the storage time of V23, the most low-temperature-resistant strain. Genome shuffling greatly improved the low-temperature resistance of V. volvacea, and shortened the course of screening required to generate desirable strains. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to apply genome shuffling to breeding new varieties of mushroom, and offers a new approach for breeding edible fungi with optimized phenotype.

EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) is a 10-channel spectroradiometer onboard DSCOVR (Deep Space Climate Observatory) spacecraft. In addition to the near-infrared (NIR, 780 nm) and the 'red' (680 nm),channels, EPIC also has the 02 A-band (764 +/- 0.2 nm) and B-band (687.75 +/- 0.2 nm). The EPIC Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is defined as the difference between NIR and 'red' channels normalized to their sum. However, the use of the O2 B-band instead of the 'red' channel mitigates the effect of atmosphere on remote sensing of surface reflectance because O2 reduces contribution from the radiation scattered by the atmosphere. Applying the radiative transfer theory and the spectral invariant approximation to EPIC observations, the paper provides supportive arguments for using the O2 band instead of the red channel for monitoring vegetation dynamics. Our results suggest that the use of the O2 B-band enhances the sensitivity of the top-of-atmosphere NDVI to the presence of vegetation. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	4.2
The traditional power control schemes for induction heating device mainly focus on the pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and the pulse density modulation. But they cannot solve the problems of power control, efficiency, and load-adaption well. This paper presents and analyzes the asymmetrical frequency modulation (AFM) control scheme used in the full-bridge series resonant inverter. With the proposed AFM control technique, the output power is controlled by two variables: the operation frequency and the division factor. Better efficiency performance can be achieved in the medium and low output power range when compared with PFM. The principles as well as the zero-voltage switching condition of the AFM are explained and the power losses of switches are analyzed. A control algorithm that schedules the three control modes of AFM is experimentally verified with a digital signal processor based induction heating prototype. The load-adaption, noise and thermal distribution problem of switches are also analyzed.	1.4
Major basketball competitions are characterized by complex and rapid attack and defense phases, mainly involving higher execution speed in performing technical procedures as well as individual and collective tactical actions. This research aims at presenting to basketball coaches the results we obtained by applying the PROFILE OF NONVERBAL SENSITIVITY (PONS) nonverbal communication test (N. AMBADY 1980). We consider that the optimization of this type of communication can improve game relations among players, as well as between athletes and coaches, in implementing game tactics and in achieving outstanding performance.

Background: Food allergen labeling is an important tool to reduce risk of exposure and prevent anaphylaxis for individuals with food allergies. Health Canada released a Canadian food allergen labeling regulation (2008) and subsequent update (2012) suggesting that research is needed to guide further iterations of the regulation to improve food allergen labeling and reduce risk of exposure. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to examine consumer preferences in food labeling for allergy avoidance and anaphylaxis prevention. A secondary objective was to identify whether different subgroups within the consumer population emerged. Methods: A discrete choice experiment using a fractional factorial design divided into ten different versions with 18 choice-sets per version was developed to examine consumer preferences for different attributes of food labeling. Results: Three distinct subgroups of Canadian consumers with different allergen considerations and food allergen labeling needs were identified. Overall, preferences for standardized precautionary and safety symbols at little or no increased cost emerged. Conclusion: While three distinct groups with different preferences were identified, in general the results revealed that the current Canadian food allergen labeling regulation can be improved by enforcing the use of standardized precautionary and safety symbols and educating the public on the use of these symbols.	5.1
Quality control of laser additive manufactured medical implants is of interest, especially if nondestructive quality control can be performed on parts before implantation. X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT or CT) can be used for defect/porosity analysis as well as for comparing the part surface with its computer-aided design (CAD) file. In both cases, the limited use of CT is partly due to the variation in scan types and the quality of scans that can occur. We present a simple method demonstrating the use of a light metal casting as a reference porosity sample, to confirm good CT image quality and to quantify minimum detectable pore size for the selected CT scan settings. This makes a good comparison for additive manufactured parts, since castings generally contain more porosity. A full part-to-CAD comparison shows how the part is compared with its CAD file, as a second-quality control. The accuracy of the CAD variance is given by the minimum detectable pore size. Finally, the part is sectioned and scanned at two higher resolution settings showing small porosity (10-50 mu m diameter) present but well distributed, as expected.	3.0
Objective: A previous study conducted by our group found theory of mind (ToM) differences in preschool children who sustained mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) compared with typically developing peers, 6 months postinjury. The goals of the current longitudinal study were to determine whether these findings are the result of a brain-injury-specific effect or rather a general-injury effect, to examine the long-term evolution of ToM skills following preschool mTBI, as well as to investigate the links between ToM abilities and general social functioning. Method: Seventy-two children who sustained mTBI between the ages of 18 and 60 months were evaluated 6 and 18 months postinjury on ToM tasks including desires and emotions reasoning and false belief understanding. They were compared with 58 participants who sustained an orthopedic injury (OI) and 83 typically developing children (TDC). Results: The 3 groups did not differ on demographic and baseline characteristics. The mTBI group obtained poorer scores relative to both comparison groups on the desires and emotions reasoning task, both at 6 and 18 months injury. No correlations were found between injury characteristics and ToM performance. For the mTBI group, associations were found between ToM performance and global social competence. Conclusion: These findings suggest a brain-injury-specific effect that persists in the long-term following mTBI in preschool children.	2.1
Chemistry was already pioneered by ancient Egyptians up to 4000 years ago. Despite its age, chemistry is by no means a dying scientific discipline. The different branches of study within chemistry have infiltrated all fields of life science research, and nobody can work in this area without using chemistry in the broadest sense. The present article is a personal view on how chemistry supports life science research, in particular in the field of nutrition and metabolism research. It provides insight into how chemistry, in close collaboration with life science research, helps to fill the gaps between our current fragmentary understanding and the comprehensive knowledge required for better understanding the molecular details of metabolism, health and disease, and aging. The most important contributions of the chemical disciplines to these studies with respect to a systems biological description of human nutrition and metabolism will be outlined.	6.2
The goal of the study was to determine if people's endorsement of different moral foundations influences their degree of prosocial behavior in a set of economic exchange games. Moral Foundations Theory has proven to be a useful means of categorizing ideas about morality and predicting opinions on aspects of social justice, political orientation, and other constructs related to prosocial behavior. This study sought to determine if Progressivism, the degree to which individuals endorse the individualizing moral foundations (i.e., Harm/Care and Fairness/Reciprocity) over the binding moral foundations (i.e., In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity), would lead to more frequent cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, a higher level of investment in the Trust Game, a higher level of return of one's partner's investment in the Trust Game, and fewer points stolen in the Thieves' Game. The results indicated no relationship between Progressivism and performance in the Thieves' Game. In three separate linear regressions controlling for age, gender, race, and Big-5 personality traits Progressivism was associated with more frequent cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma, a higher level of investment in the Trust Game, and a higher level of return of one's partner's investment in the Trust Game. Therefore it does appear that moral foundations do predict performance in economic exchange games and that,a greater endorsement of Progressivism is associated with more prosocial behavior.

To evade the well-known impossibility of unconditionally secure quantum two-party computations, previous quantum private comparison protocols have to adopt a third party. Here, we study how far we can go with two parties only. We propose a very feasible and efficient protocol. Intriguingly, although the average amount of information leaked cannot be made arbitrarily small, we find that this average will not exceed 14 bits for any length of the bit-string being compared.	0.3
Two principal types of human in vivo studies with non-pharmaceuticals can be distinguished: (1) human metabolism studies are used for identification of target metabolites which can subsequently be used in biological monitoring studies. Furthermore, they allow extrapolation from excretion of metabolite(s) to exposure to the parent compound on the basis of an understanding of human pharmacokinetics. (?) Pharmacodynamic or effect studies are restricted to the study of acute and inherently reversible changes and are most likely to improve risk assessment in the following areas: neurobehavioural effects (e.g, alcohol, organic solvents), alterations in biochemical markers (e.g. cholinesterase inhibition following organophosphate exposure) and topical effects (e.g, skin irritancy). Ethical considerations al e of prime importance and, as a minimum, any human study must comply with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol should include scientifically sound objectives, a justification of subject numbers. a formal risk-benefit analysis and provisions for appropriate ethical review. The welfare of the individual participating in the study must be paramount. Informed consent has to be obtained and subjects must be free to withdraw from the study at any time. Compensation should be given for the inconvenience of participating in the study. but never for undergoing risk. Provided these conditions are met, human volunteer studies can be a powerful tool in risk assessment and risk management of exposure to non-pharmaceutical products.

The emergence of proteomics has led to major technological advances in mass spectrometry (MS). These advancements not only benefitted MS-based high-throughput proteomics but also increased the impact of mass spectrometry on the field of structural and molecular biology. Here, we review how state-of-the-art MS methods, including native MS, top-down protein sequencing, cross-linking-MS, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange-MS, nowadays enable the characterization of biomolecular structures, functions, and interactions. In particular, we focus on the role of mass spectrometry in integrated structural and molecular biology investigations of biological macromolecular complexes and cellular machineries, highlighting work on CRISPR-Cas systems and eukaryotic transcription complexes.	6.0
Background: Previous genomewide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of putative risk loci for alcohol dependence (AD). However, only a few loci have replicated and these replicated variants only explain a small proportion of AD risk. Using an innovative approach, the goal of this study was to generate hypotheses about potentially causal variants for AD that can be explored further through functional studies. Methods: We employed targeted capture of 71 candidate loci and flanking regions followed by next-generation deep sequencing (mean coverage 78X) in 806 European Americans. Regions included in our targeted capture library were genes identified through published GWAS of alcohol, all human alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases, reward system genes including dopaminergic and opioid receptors, prioritized candidate genes based on previous associations, and genes involved in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. We performed single-locus tests to determine if any single variant was associated with AD symptom count. Sets of variants that overlapped with biologically meaningful annotations were tested for association in aggregate. Results: No single, common variant was significantly associated with AD in our study. We did, however, find evidence for association with several variant sets. Two variant sets were significant at the q-value <0.10 level: a genic enhancer for ADHFE1 (p=1.47x10(-5); q=0.019), an alcohol dehydrogenase, and ADORA1 (p=5.29x10(-5); q=0.035), an adenosine receptor that belongs to a G-protein-coupled receptor gene family. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first sequencing study of AD to examine variants in entire genes, including flanking and regulatory regions. We found that in addition to protein coding variant sets, regulatory variant sets may play a role in AD. From these findings, we have generated initial functional hypotheses about how these sets may influence AD.	6.4
This paper presents a new approach to infer worldwide malware-infected machines by solely analyzing their generated probing activities. In contrary to other adopted methods, the proposed approach does not rely on symptoms of infection to detect compromised machines. This allows the inference of malware infection at very early stages of contamination. The approach aims at detecting whether the machines are infected or not as well as pinpointing the exact malware type/family. The latter insights allow network security operators of diverse organizations, Internet service providers and backbone networks to promptly detect their clients' compromised machines in addition to effectively providing them with tailored anti-malware/patch solutions. To achieve the intended goals, the proposed approach exploits the darknet Internet space and initially filters out misconfiguration traffic targeting such space using a probabilistic model. Subsequently, the approach employs statistical methods to infer large-scale probing activities as perceived by the dark space. Consequently, such activities are correlated with malware samples by leveraging fuzzy hashing and entropy based techniques. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated using a recent 60 GB of real darknet traffic and 65 thousand real malware samples. The results concur that the rationale of exploiting probing activities for worldwide early malware infection detection is indeed very promising. Further, the results, which were validated using publically available data resources, demonstrate that the extracted inferences exhibit noteworthy accuracy and can generate significant cyber security insights that could be used for effective mitigation.

Research on intergroup contact has grown exponentially over the past decade. Such research has typically extolled the benefits of positive interaction between members of historically divided communities, particularly on outcomes related to prejudice reduction. Emerging work in the field, however, has qualified this optimistic picture by identifying three gaps in the existing literature. First, in everyday life, contact may be construed as a negative experience that increases rather than decreases responses such as prejudice, anxiety, and avoidance. Second, in real-life settings, contact is often circumscribed by informal practices of (re)segregation that are easily overlooked if researchers rely primarily on examining structured contact and explicit processes using primarily laboratory and questionnaire methods. Third, positive contact may have ironic effects on the political attitudes and behaviors of the historically disadvantaged, undermining their recognition of social injustice and decreasing their willingness to engage in collective action to challenge the status quo. Although it is now a truism that intergroup contact can reduce intergroup prejudice, these developments emphasize the importance of maintaining a critical perspective on the contact hypothesis as a model for promoting social change in historically divided and unequal societies. They also lay the foundations for future developments in the field.	2.0
Chronic health conditions of the elderly lead to limitations in physical activity with disability, anxiety, and increased need for medical care and assisted living conditions. Physical performance tests are used to screen for pending loss of mobility and can serve as endpoints to monitor the effectiveness of intervention measures. Since limited mobility is associated with the physical and mental health of a person, evaluation of this in preclinical aging studies in mice will provide a translational approach for testing new intervention strategies. We assessed physiological parameters in 4, 12, 20 and 28 month old C57BL/6 and CB6F1 male mice using a rotating rod, a free running wheel, and a photo beam activity field, designed to determine changes in coordinated walking ability, self-motivated running distance, and anxiety response to a novel environment, respectively. Older mice showed decreased coordinated walking times and decreased running distances, predictive of physical performance ability and motivation in the elderly. Changes in both lateral and vertical movements were observed in a novel cage environment suggesting different levels of anxiety. Because the genetic background of the two mouse strains influenced test results in an age-dependent manner, it is imperative to recognize that diverse genetic backgrounds in mice may yield different data in preclinical studies and would need to be interpreted individually for translational applications.

This research examined how affective and cognitive responses to culture fusion, a specific type of culture mixing that features the blending of different cultures or parts thereof into a new entity, are influenced by individual differences in Need for Closure (NFC). Two studies showed that individuals high (vs. low) in NFC felt less favorable toward culture fusion (i.e., the affective response), both at an abstract level (i.e., society structure models; Study 1, N = 191) and at a more concrete level (i.e., food stimuli; Study 2, N = 257). In addition, high NFC individuals tended to assign culturally fused stimuli to one discrete culture, rather than acknowledging them as culturally hybrid (i.e., the cognitive response). Furthermore, mediation analyses showed that the relationships between NFC and responses toward culture fusion were mediated by Right-Wing Authoritarianism. These findings are interpreted in terms of the threat to epistemic security needs posed by culture fusion.	2.0
With the advances of stem cell research, development of intelligent biomaterials and three-dimensional biofabrication strategies, highly mimicked tissue or organs can be engineered. Among all the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting based on inkjet printing technology has the promises to deliver and create biomimicked tissue with high throughput, digital control, and the capacity of single cell manipulation. Therefore, this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. The most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review, including vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In addition, the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery, which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. With layer-by-layer assembly, three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. Therefore, bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues. Collectively, bioprinting has great potential and broad applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The future advances of bioprinting include the integration of different printing mechanisms to engineer biphasic or triphasic tissues with optimized scaffolds and further understanding of stem cell biology.	1.4
Social pressure exerted by urban development, the increase in erosion on many coastal stretches, and the rise in sea level due to climate change over the last few decades have led governments to increase investment in coastal protection. In turn, a reduction in costs and increases in ease of construction and rate of implementation have led to sand-filled geotextile elements, such as bags, tubes, and containers, becoming an alternative or supplement to traditional coastal defence materials, such as rubble mounds, concrete, and so on. Not all coastal zones are appropriate for sand-filled geotextile structures as coastal defences. This article analyses suitable zones for locating geotextile bag revetments to protect coasts from storm erosion and concludes that the least suitable zones are the surf zone (on an open coast and on a slightly protected coast) and deep water (on an open coast), except if a suitable reinforcement is carried out when the demand makes it necessary this build this kind of defence.	4.1
This study focuses on four textile industries (DH-GEDA, NOYA, ALMHADI, and ALSAR) established between 2005 and 2008 in the peri-urban areas of Dukem and Gelan. The objectives of the study were to generate baseline information regarding the concentration levels of selected pollutants and to analyze their effects on biophysical environments. This study also attempts to explore the level of exposure that humans and livestock have to polluted effluents and the effects thereof. The findings of this study are based on data empirically collected from two sources: laboratory analysis of sample effluents from the four selected textile plants and quantitative as well as qualitative socioeconomic data collection. As part of the latter, a household survey and focus group discussions (FGDs) with elderly and other focal persons were employed in the towns of Dukem and Gelan. The results of the study show that large concentrations of biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and pH were found in all the observed textile industries, at levels beyond the permissible discharge limit set by the national Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). Furthermore, sulfide (S-2), R-phosphate (R-PO43), and Zn were found in large concentrations in DH-GEDA and ALMHADI, while high concentrations were also identified in samples taken from ALSAR and ALMHADI. In spite of the clear-cut legal tools, this study shows that the local environment, people, and their livestock are exposed to highly contaminated effluents. We therefore recommend that the respective federal and regional government bodies should reexamine the compliance to and actual implementation of the existing legal procedures and regulations and respond appropriately.	4.4
Dense motion field estimation is a key computer vision problem. Many solutions have been proposed to compute small or large displacements, narrow or wide baseline stereo disparity, or non-rigid surface registration, but a unified methodology is still lacking. The authors introduce a general framework that robustly combines direct and feature-based matching. The feature-based cost is built around a novel robust distance function that handles keypoints and weak features such as segments. It allows us to use putative feature matches to guide dense motion estimation out of local minima. The authors' framework uses a robust direct data term. It is implemented with a powerful second-order regularisation with external and self-occlusion reasoning. Their framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in several cases (standard optical flow benchmarks, wide-baseline stereo and non-rigid surface registration). Their framework has a modular design that customises to specific application needs.	0.0
Background: The Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS: SFHS) is a family-based population cohort with DNA, biological samples, socio-demographic, psychological and clinical data from approximately 24,000 adult volunteers across Scotland. Although data collection was cross-sectional, GS: SFHS became a prospective cohort due to of the ability to link to routine Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Over 20,000 participants were selected for genotyping using a large genome-wide array. Methods: GS: SFHS was analysed using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to test the effects of a large spectrum of variants, imputed using the Haplotype Research Consortium (HRC) dataset, on medically relevant traits measured directly or obtained from EHRs. The HRC dataset is the largest available haplotype reference panel for imputation of variants in populations of European ancestry and allows investigation of variants with low minor allele frequencies within the entire GS: SFHS genotyped cohort. Results: Genome-wide associations were run on 20,032 individuals using both genotyped and HRC imputed data. We present results for a range of well-studied quantitative traits obtained from clinic visits and for serum urate measures obtained from data linkage to EHRs collected by the Scottish National Health Service. Results replicated known associations and additionally reveal novel findings, mainly with rare variants, validating the use of the HRC imputation panel. For example, we identified two new associations with fasting glucose at variants near to Y_RNA and WDR4 and four new associations with heart rate at SNPs within CSMD1 and ASPH, upstream of HTR1F and between PROKR2 and GPCPD1. All were driven by rare variants (minor allele frequencies in the range of 0.08-1%). Proof of principle for use of EHRs was verification of the highly significant association of urate levels with the well-established urate transporter SLC2A9. Conclusions: GS: SFHS provides genetic data on over 20,000 participants alongside a range of phenotypes as well as linkage to National Health Service laboratory and clinical records. We have shown that the combination of deeper genotype imputation and extended phenotype availability make GS: SFHS an attractive resource to carry out association studies to gain insight into the genetic architecture of complex traits.	6.4
Purpose The application of organic and inorganic fertilizers to soil can result in increased gaseous emissions, such as NH3, N2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as nitrate leaching, contributing to climate warming and ground and surface water pollution, particularly in regions with hot climates, where high temperatures and high soil nitrification rates often occur. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NIs) has been shown to effectively decrease nitrogen (N) losses from the soil-plant system. Materials and methods Non-disruptive laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to assess the extent to which temperature (20 and 30 degrees C) and nutrient source (mineral and organic fertilizers) influence the rate of carbon (C)- and N-related microbial processes in soil in response to the NI 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). Furthermore, short-term changes in the ability of microbes to degrade C substrates were evaluated in disruptive soil microcosms using microbial community-level physiological profiling and the abundance of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene as a measure of total bacterial population size. Results and discussion DMPP reduced net nitrification after 2 and 4 weeks of incubation at 30 and 20 degrees C by an average of 78.3 and 84.5 %, respectively, and with similar dynamics for mineral or organic fertilization. The addition of labile organic matter with cattle effluent led to a rapid increase in C mineralization that was significantly reduced by DMPP at both temperatures, whereas no changes could be detected after the addition of mineral fertilizer. The culturable heterotrophic microorganisms showed metabolic diversification in the oxidation of C sources, with organic fertilizer playing a major role in the substrate utilization patterns during the first week of incubation and the DMPP effects prevailing from day 14 until day 28. Furthermore, the copy number of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was reduced by the application of DMPP and organic fertilizer after 28 days. Conclusions Our results show the marked efficiency of DMPP as an NI at elevated temperatures of incubation and when associated with both mineral and organic fertilization, providing support for its use as a tool to mitigate N losses in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, we also observed impaired C respiration rates and bacterial abundances, as well as shifts in communitylevel physiological profiles in soil, possibly indicating a short-term effect of DMPP and organic fertilizers on non-target Crelated processes and microorganisms.	4.4
The pathophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begin decades before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Understanding the early mechanisms associated with AD pathology is, therefore, especially important for identifying disease-modifying therapeutic targets. While the majority of AD clinical trials to date have focused on anti-amyloid-beta (A beta) treatments, other therapeutic approaches may be necessary. The ability to monitor changes in cellular networks that include both A beta and non-A beta pathways is essential to advance our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of AD and subsequent development of cognitive symptoms and dementia. Metabolomics is a powerful tool that detects perturbations in the metabolome, a pool of metabolites that reflects changes downstream of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic fluctuations, and represents an accurate biochemical profile of the organism in health and disease. The application of metabolomics could help to identify biomarkers for early AD diagnosis, to discover novel therapeutic targets, and to monitor therapeutic response and disease progression. Moreover, given the considerable parallel between mouse and human metabolism, the use of metabolomics provides ready translation of animal research into human studies for accelerated drug design. In this review, we will summarize current progress in the application of metabolomics in both animal models and in humans to further understanding of the mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis.

During the last decades photogrammetric computer vision systems have been well established in scientific and commercial applications. Recent developments in image-based 3D reconstruction systems have resulted in an easy way of creating realistic, visually appealing and accurate 3D models. We present a fully automated processing pipeline for metric and geo-accurate 3D reconstructions of complex geometries supported by an online feedback method for user guidance during image acquisition. Our approach is suited for seamlessly matching and integrating images with different scales, from different view points (aerial and terrestrial), and with different cameras into one single reconstruction. We evaluate our approach based on different datasets for applications in mining, archaeology and urban environments and thus demonstrate the flexibility and high accuracy of our approach. Our evaluation includes accuracy related analyses investigating camera self-calibration, georegistration and camera network configuration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	0.0
